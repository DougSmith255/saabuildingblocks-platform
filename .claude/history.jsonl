Use your collective intelligence to solve the objective efficiently. The Queen must coordinate, workers must collaborate, and the hive must think as one.\n\nRemember: You are not just coordinating agents - you are orchestrating a collective intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts.","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1762288195129,"project":"/home/claude-flow","sessionId":"56573755-c6a9-48f3-987e-155dafe0c636"}
