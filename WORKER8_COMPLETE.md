## Verification Results

### Pre-Archive Production Check
```
‚úÖ HTTP 200 - Site healthy
‚úÖ Next.js cache operational
‚úÖ Cloudflare CDN responding
```

### Post-Archive Production Check
```
‚úÖ HTTP 200 - Site still healthy
‚úÖ No impact on production
‚úÖ All files safely archived
```

### Archive Statistics
- **Total files moved:** 27
- **Total size:** ~340KB
- **Source directories cleaned:**
  - `/home/claude-flow/nextjs-frontend/tests/`
  - `/home/claude-flow/nextjs-frontend/` (root)

## Why These Files Were Archived

**Characteristics of archived files:**
1. ‚ùå Zero references in package.json scripts
2. ‚ùå Manual verification scripts (not automated tests)
3. ‚ùå One-time debugging/investigation scripts
4. ‚ùå Duplicate functionality (e.g., multiple 404 visual checks)
5. ‚úÖ Historical value (preserved in archive, not deleted)

**Modern test strategy (Agent 2's recommendation):**
- Automated E2E tests via Playwright (in tests/ directory)
- Integration tests in __tests__/ directory
- Unit tests co-located with components
- CI/CD pipeline execution (not manual scripts)

---

## Production Safety

**Pre-archive verification:**
```bash
curl -I https://saabuildingblocks.com
# HTTP 200 ‚úÖ
```

**Post-archive verification:**
```bash
curl -I https://saabuildingblocks.com
# HTTP 200 ‚úÖ
```

**Impact Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ No production code modified
- ‚úÖ No build scripts affected
- ‚úÖ No CI/CD pipelines impacted
- ‚úÖ Test files only moved (not deleted)
- ‚úÖ Can be restored from archive if needed

---

## File Restoration (If Needed)

**To restore an archived file:**
```bash
cp /home/claude-flow/.archive/2025-10-25-consolidation/obsolete-tests/FILENAME /home/claude-flow/nextjs-frontend/
```

**To restore all files:**
```bash
cp /home/claude-flow/.archive/2025-10-25-consolidation/obsolete-tests/* /home/claude-flow/nextjs-frontend/tests/
```

## Next Steps (Recommendations)

1. ‚úÖ **Completed:** Obsolete tests archived
2. üîÑ **Pending:** Remove references in documentation (if any)
3. üîÑ **Pending:** Update test documentation to reflect modern strategy
4. ‚úÖ **Verified:** Production unaffected by cleanup
