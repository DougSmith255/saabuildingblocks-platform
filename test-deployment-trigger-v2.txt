Deployment test v2 - 2025-10-29 04:26 UTC

Testing deployment workflow after CSS generation fix (commit 645bd9b)

Expected result:
- ✅ Health check passes (homepage returns 307 redirect)
- ✅ Build succeeds (CSS generation removed, static file used instead)
- ✅ Deployment to Cloudflare Pages completes successfully

This test verifies the complete end-to-end workflow:
WordPress Button → GitHub Actions → Cloudflare Pages
