# Deployment Tab Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you complete the setup of the new Deployment Tab in Master Controller, which provides centralized control over:
- CSS regeneration from Master Controller settings
- Cloudflare Pages deployments
- WordPress webhook integration

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps
- [x] Backend API routes created (`/api/master-controller/regenerate-css`, `/api/master-controller/deploy`, `/api/webhooks/wordpress`)
- [x] Frontend DeploymentTab component built
- [x] Migration SQL file created
- [x] WordPress webhook documentation created

## üîß Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Add GitHub Token to Environment

**Why needed:** The deployment API needs to trigger GitHub Actions workflows.

1. **Create GitHub Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name it: `SAA Master Controller Deployment`
   - Select scopes:
     - ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - ‚úÖ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

2. **Add token to environment file:**
   ```bash
   # Edit the file
   nano /home/claude-flow/packages/admin-dashboard/.env.local

   # Add this line (replace with your actual token):
   GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

3. **Verify the token is set:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/claude-flow/packages/admin-dashboard
   grep GITHUB_TOKEN .env.local
   ```

### Step 2: Run Database Migration

**Why needed:** The deployment system logs all activities to the `deployment_logs` table.

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `edpsaqcsoeccioapglhi`

2. **Navigate to SQL Editor:**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy and execute the migration SQL:**
   ```bash
   # Option A: Copy from file
   cat /home/claude-flow/packages/admin-dashboard/supabase/migrations/20251030200000_create_deployment_logs.sql

   # Option B: Use the SQL output from run-migration-direct.js (see above)
   ```

4. **Paste into SQL Editor and click "Run"**

5. **Verify table was created:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM deployment_logs LIMIT 1;
   ```

   You should see: "No rows returned" (table exists but is empty) ‚úÖ

### Step 3: Restart Admin Dashboard (if running)

**Why needed:** Load the new GitHub token into the environment.

```bash
cd /home/claude-flow/packages/admin-dashboard
pm2 restart nextjs-saa
# or if running in development:
# Press Ctrl+C and run: npm run dev
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test 1: CSS Regeneration

1. **Navigate to Master Controller:**
   - URL: https://saabuildingblocks.com/master-controller
   - Or: http://localhost:3000/master-controller (if testing locally)

2. **Go to Deployment tab**

3. **Click "Regenerate Static CSS":**
   - Should see loading state
   - Should see success toast notification
   - Should display file size and timestamp
   - Check terminal logs for execution details

4. **Verify CSS file was updated:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh /home/claude-flow/packages/public-site/public/static-master-controller.css
   # Check the timestamp - should be recent
   ```

5. **Verify CSS contains latest settings:**
   ```bash
   grep "Generated:" /home/claude-flow/packages/public-site/public/static-master-controller.css
   # Should show today's date
   ```

### Test 2: Cloudflare Deployment Trigger

1. **Click "Deploy to Cloudflare":**
   - Should see loading state
   - Should see success toast: "Deployment triggered"
   - If you click again within 5 minutes, should see rate limit message

2. **Verify GitHub Actions workflow was triggered:**
   ```bash
   # Check recent workflow runs
   gh workflow list
   gh run list --workflow=deploy-cloudflare.yml --limit 5
   ```

3. **Check deployment logs in database:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor
   - Open `deployment_logs` table
   - Should see entry with:
     - `trigger_type`: 'deploy'
     - `triggered_by`: 'master-controller'
     - `status`: 'triggered'
     - Recent timestamp

### Test 3: Deployment History

1. **In the Deployment tab, scroll to "Recent Deployments" section**

2. **Should see:**
   - Table with your recent actions
   - Columns: Time, Type, Triggered By, Status, Duration
   - Most recent entries at top

3. **Trigger multiple actions to populate history:**
   - Regenerate CSS 2-3 times
   - Try deploying once
   - Refresh page - history should persist

### Test 4: End-to-End Workflow

1. **Make a typography change:**
   - Go to Typography tab
   - Change button size from 20-35px to 22-40px
   - Click "Save Typography Settings"

2. **Deploy the change:**
   - Go to Deployment tab
   - Click "Regenerate Static CSS"
   - Wait for success
   - Click "Deploy to Cloudflare"

3. **Wait for deployment (3-5 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Monitor GitHub Actions
   gh run watch
   ```

4. **Verify on Cloudflare Pages:**
   - Go to https://saabuildingblocks.pages.dev
   - Inspect button elements
   - Should see new `font-size: clamp(22px, ..., 40px)`

## üîó Optional: Update WordPress Plugin

**Current state:** WordPress plugin fires webhook directly to GitHub Actions.

**New option:** Fire webhook to Master Controller instead (provides better logging and control).

### Steps to Update:

1. **In WordPress admin:**
   - Go to Plugins ‚Üí Editor
   - Select "SAA Auto Rebuild"
   - Find the webhook URL (around line 50)

2. **Change webhook URL:**
   ```php
   // OLD:
   $webhook_url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/...';

   // NEW:
   $webhook_url = 'https://saabuildingblocks.com/api/webhooks/wordpress';
   ```

3. **Test by publishing a blog post:**
   - Create a new post or update existing
   - Publish/update
   - Check Supabase `deployment_logs` - should see entry with `trigger_type: 'blog'`

**Note:** This is optional. The old webhook will continue to work. The new endpoint just provides better visibility.

## üìä Monitoring & Logs

### View API Logs (PM2):
```bash
pm2 logs nextjs-saa --lines 100
```

### View Deployment Logs (Supabase):
```sql
-- Recent deployments
SELECT * FROM deployment_logs
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Failed deployments
SELECT * FROM deployment_logs
WHERE status = 'error'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Deployment stats
SELECT
  trigger_type,
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(duration) as avg_duration_ms
FROM deployment_logs
GROUP BY trigger_type, status;
```

### View GitHub Actions:
```bash
# List workflows
gh workflow list

# View recent runs
gh run list --limit 10

# Watch live run
gh run watch
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to trigger deployment"

**Check:**
1. GitHub token is set in `.env.local`
2. Token has correct scopes (`repo`, `workflow`)
3. Token hasn't expired
4. PM2 process restarted after adding token

**Fix:**
```bash
cd /home/claude-flow/packages/admin-dashboard
grep GITHUB_TOKEN .env.local  # Should show token
pm2 restart nextjs-saa        # Reload environment
```

### Issue: "Could not find table 'deployment_logs'"

**Check:**
1. Migration was run successfully in Supabase Dashboard
2. Table exists in public schema

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name = 'deployment_logs';
```

If returns no rows, re-run the migration SQL.

### Issue: Rate limit message even though 5+ minutes passed

**Check deployment_logs table:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM deployment_logs
WHERE trigger_type = 'deploy'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

If timestamp is stuck, manually update:
```sql
UPDATE deployment_logs
SET created_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'
WHERE id = 'paste-id-here';
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know the setup is complete when:
- [x] GitHub token is in environment and valid
- [x] `deployment_logs` table exists in Supabase
- [x] Admin dashboard restarted with new token
- [x] "Regenerate CSS" button works and updates file
- [x] "Deploy to Cloudflare" button triggers GitHub Actions
- [x] Deployment history displays in UI
- [x] End-to-end workflow (change ‚Üí regenerate ‚Üí deploy) completes successfully
