# Turbopack Compatibility Check

## Why is Turbopack Disabled?

As of 2025-01-08, Turbopack is disabled due to a compatibility issue with Tailwind CSS v4.

**Error**: `Module not found: Can't resolve '...'` in `globals.css:3:33045`

The issue occurs when Turbopack tries to process the CSS generated by Tailwind CSS v4's `@import "tailwindcss"` directive.

## How to Test if Turbopack is Now Compatible

Run this command from the `packages/public-site` directory:

```bash
# Test build with Turbopack enabled
NODE_ENV=production npx next build
```

If the build succeeds without the CSS module resolution error, you can re-enable Turbopack!

## How to Re-enable Turbopack

1. Remove `TURBOPACK: "0"` from `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml` (line 113)
2. Test locally with the command above
3. Commit and push to trigger a deployment
4. Delete this file if Turbopack is working

## Automatic Check Schedule

A GitHub Actions workflow runs monthly to test if Turbopack compatibility has been restored.
