    "content": "<p>In this comparison between LPT vs Redfin, agents will find significant differences in commission splits, income opportunities, and the type of support provided by each brokerage. Both companies have unique models that cater to different career paths and goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Redfin</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a flexible commission split structure, ranging from 80/20 to 100/0, with no franchise or royalty fee. The production cap is set at $15K, and agents also receive stock bonuses as part of their earnings, although the amount of stock is not specified. LPT Realty’s transaction fees are $195 before agents hit the cap, and their monthly fees vary depending on the agent&#8217;s plan, with options like $500/year or $149/month. This fee structure makes LPT Realty a strong contender for agents who want flexibility and ownership opportunities.</p>\n<p>Redfin, in contrast, operates with a very different model, offering commission splits that range from 30/70 to 75/25. Redfin agents do not pay a franchise or royalty fee, but they also do not have the same earning potential as LPT Realty agents. Redfin does not offer a production cap, meaning agents are always subject to the split structure. One of the unique aspects of Redfin is that agents receive a salary in addition to commission, but the relatively low splits and lack of additional income opportunities may not be attractive to agents looking to maximize their earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out for offering agents multiple streams of income, including stock bonuses, a revenue share program, and willable income paths. The revenue share program provides an extra layer of financial stability by allowing agents to earn a percentage of the commission from agents they recruit into the company. This additional income stream is a key advantage for agents seeking to build long-term wealth.</p>\n<p>Redfin does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income, or willable income. However, it provides a salary, which offers some stability for agents who prefer a more structured compensation model. While this can be appealing for newer agents or those who prioritize a steady paycheck, the lack of passive income opportunities may not be ideal for experienced agents looking to grow their wealth.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not offer structured training programs, which can be a disadvantage for newer agents who need more guidance. However, they do provide 24/7 agent support, which ensures agents can get assistance at any time.</p>\n<p>Redfin, on the other hand, has a more established training program with four weeks of local training, which can be beneficial for agents learning the ropes. However, there is no 24/7 support, which can be limiting for agents working non-traditional hours or in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers agents a range of technological tools to help streamline their business, including CRM systems and marketing platforms, though specific tools are not detailed. The company’s model focuses on giving agents the autonomy to run their businesses with modern technology at their disposal.</p>\n<p>Redfin is known for its tech-driven platform and provides agents with access to proprietary tools, lead generation, and a strong online presence. For agents who value technology and automation, Redfin’s platform can be highly appealing, but it comes at the cost of lower earnings potential.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars based on 37 reviews, where agents praise the income opportunities and flexible commission structure. However, some agents express a desire for more training and structured support.</p>\n<p>Redfin has a Glassdoor rating of 3.6 stars from 1.9K reviews. While many agents appreciate the salary structure and technology-driven model, others raise concerns about the limited income potential and relatively low commission splits.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Redfin</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides more income flexibility through its higher commission splits, revenue share program, and stock bonuses. For agents looking for long-term wealth-building opportunities and independence, LPT Realty offers more favorable options.</p>\n<p>Redfin, on the other hand, offers a salary model that provides financial stability, along with strong technological tools and leads. However, the lower commission splits and lack of additional income streams may be limiting for agents who want to maximize their earnings.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

Importantly, LPT Realty doesn’t charge a franchise or royalty fee, so agents keep more of their income. The production cap at LPT Realty is $15K, after which agents retain 100% of their commissions. Monthly fees at LPT Realty range from $0 (with a yearly plan) to $149/month, and the transaction fee before the cap is $195.</p>\n<p>Century 21 offers commission splits ranging from 70/30 to 92/8, which is less favorable compared to LPT’s top-tier splits. Additionally, Century 21 charges an 8% franchise fee, even after the agent reaches their production cap. The production cap at Century 21 is higher, set at $22.5K, and monthly fees vary from $0 to $350. Transaction fees are included in the franchise fees, simplifying the fee structure, but the ongoing franchise fee is a major drawback.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out with its revenue share program, allowing agents to earn additional income by attracting new agents to the company. LPT also offers retirement income paths and willable income, which provides long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>Century 21 does not offer revenue share income, retirement income paths, or willable income. Agents at Century 21 are primarily reliant on their commissions, which may limit income potential compared to LPT Realty’s diverse opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>At LPT Realty, training availability and quality can vary depending on the location, and there is no 24/7 agent support, which could be a drawback for agents needing round-the-clock assistance. However, LPT does offer an extensive support network for agents through its technology platforms.</p>\n<p>Century 21 offers training that also varies by office, but agents don’t have access to 24/7 support, which can limit their ability to seek help when needed. While the brand has a good reputation for training, the experience can be inconsistent depending on the office.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty is a newer brokerage, meaning its technology and resources are built on modern, cloud-based systems. Agents have access to digital tools that streamline transactions, client management, and marketing efforts, making it ideal for those looking to leverage tech for efficiency.</p>\n<p>Century 21 offers more traditional technology, such as CRM systems and marketing tools, but the offerings vary by office. Agents may not have access to the same level of cutting-edge resources as those provided by more tech-driven brokerages like LPT Realty.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty holds a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 37 reviews. Agents highlight the flexibility of commission splits and the income potential through revenue sharing as key benefits.</p>\n<p>Century 21 has a Glassdoor rating of 4.2 stars from 1.5K reviews. While agents appreciate the company’s brand recognition and office-level support, they often mention the franchise fees as a downside.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-century-21\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Century 21</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty’s flexible commission structure, lack of franchise fees, and additional income streams through revenue share make it a better choice for agents focused on maximizing earnings and building long-term financial security. The technology-driven platform also adds to its appeal for modern agents.</p>\n<p>Century 21 remains a strong option for agents who value brand recognition and traditional support, but the higher fees and lack of additional income opportunities make it less attractive compared to LPT Realty.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

One of LPT Realty’s main attractions is the absence of franchise or royalty fees, which means agents can retain more of their earnings. The production cap at LPT Realty is $15K, and monthly fees vary from $0 to $149, depending on the agent’s preferences. Transaction fees are set at $195 before the agent hits the cap.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s International Realty, on the other hand, has commission splits that range from 70/30 to 90/10. However, agents are also subject to a 6% franchise fee, which can reduce overall earnings. Additionally, Sotheby’s does not offer a production cap, meaning agents continue to split their commission with the brokerage no matter how much they produce. Monthly fees at Sotheby’s vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the royalty fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out with its revenue share model, allowing agents to earn additional income by recruiting and growing their team. It also offers a retirement income path and willable income for agents looking to build long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s does not offer a revenue share program, retirement income, or willable income path. Agents are reliant solely on their commission-based earnings, limiting their ability to generate additional streams of income.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not provide specific training programs but does offer 24/7 agent support, which is a big plus for agents who need immediate assistance at any time of day. While it may lack structured training, the round-the-clock support helps agents stay on track and resolve issues quickly.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s offers training that varies by office, and agents benefit from the global prestige and brand recognition that comes with representing high-end properties. However, there is no 24/7 agent support, and the training quality can differ based on location.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides agents with solid technology platforms that help streamline transactions and marketing efforts. Their tools are geared toward making agents more efficient and enabling them to grow their business with minimal overhead.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s International Realty offers robust marketing tools, especially for agents who work with luxury properties. The global brand&#8217;s marketing reach is unparalleled, but the technology provided is more focused on marketing than operational efficiency compared to LPT Realty&#8217;s cloud-based solutions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 37 reviews, with agents appreciating the flexible commission splits, revenue share program, and low fees. However, some agents have pointed out that training options could be more comprehensive.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s has a Glassdoor rating of 4.0 stars from 501 reviews. Agents often praise the brand’s reputation and the luxury market access, but they also mention concerns over high fees and limited income opportunities outside of commission.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-sothebys\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Sotheby’s</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers more flexibility with commission splits, lower fees, and income-generating opportunities like revenue sharing, retirement, and willable income paths, making it a great option for agents looking for financial growth and scalability.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s, while prestigious and highly recognized in the luxury market, comes with higher costs and fewer opportunities for additional income outside of commissions.

There are no franchise or royalty fees, allowing agents to retain a larger portion of their income. Real Broker has a production cap of $12K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions. Agents also benefit from a top agent bonus of $24K, which can significantly boost their earnings. The brokerage charges a yearly fee of $750, and there are no transaction fees until the agent reaches the cap.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers commission splits that range from 60/40 to 80/20, depending on the agent’s production and office location. The brokerage charges a 6% franchise fee, which affects agents’ overall earnings. Better Homes &#038; Gardens does not offer a production cap, meaning agents will always be splitting commissions with the brokerage. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty structure, which provides some predictability in costs but limits an agent’s income growth potential compared to Real Broker.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker stands out in terms of income opportunities with its revenue share program, which enables agents to earn passive income through team building and recruitment.

Additionally, Real Broker offers a retirement income path and willable income options for agents who meet the time qualification.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens does not offer a revenue share program, retirement income path, or willable income option.

This comprehensive training and support structure is ideal for agents who want ongoing education and the flexibility to access help whenever needed.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens provides training, but the quality and availability of these programs vary by office.

    "content": "<p>This side-by-side comparison of Real Broker and Corcoran will help agents understand the differences between these two brokerages, including commission splits, income opportunities, and overall support.

Additionally, there are no franchise or royalty fees at Real Broker, allowing agents to keep more of their income. The production cap at Real Broker is set at $12K, with an additional top agent bonus of $24K. The annual fee is $750, and transaction fees are $0 until the cap is reached, making Real Broker’s fee structure simple and transparent.</p>\n<p>Corcoran, on the other hand, offers lower commission splits, ranging from 50/50 to 70/30. Agents also have to pay a 6% franchise fee, which significantly impacts their take-home pay. Corcoran does not provide a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split commissions with the brokerage no matter how much they earn. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the royalty structure, though the absence of a cap makes it less appealing for high-producing agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker stands out with its revenue share program, offering agents the chance to earn passive income through recruitment. This provides an additional revenue stream beyond commissions, which is ideal for agents focused on building a team and generating long-term wealth. Real Broker also offers a retirement income path and willable income with time qualification, further solidifying its appeal to agents looking for financial security.</p>\n<p>Corcoran does not provide any revenue share, retirement income, or willable income options. Agents at Corcoran are limited to their commission-based income, which may restrict their long-term wealth-building capabilities compared to the opportunities available at Real Broker.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers 30+ live training sessions weekly and 24/7 agent support, providing agents with the tools and resources they need to succeed. Whether you&#8217;re new or experienced, having access to real-time assistance and continuous training is a significant advantage.</p>\n<p>Corcoran’s training also varies by office, and it does not offer 24/7 agent support. While the brokerage is known for its luxury clientele, the lack of consistent training and immediate support could be a drawback for agents who require a more hands-on approach.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker uses a cloud-based platform that provides agents with cutting-edge CRM systems, marketing tools, and transaction management systems. This modern technology infrastructure ensures agents can operate efficiently and maximize productivity.</p>\n<p>Corcoran’s technology is focused on high-end marketing, tailored to its luxury market. While it provides strong marketing resources, its technology infrastructure is more traditional and may not offer the same flexibility and modern tools as Real Broker’s platform.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker holds a 4.5-star rating on Glassdoor with 109 reviews, where agents frequently highlight the revenue share model, transparent fees, and strong support system as key benefits.</p>\n<p>Corcoran has a 4.4-star rating from 321 reviews. Agents appreciate the strong brand presence and luxury market access but often mention the impact of the 6% franchise fee and lack of additional income streams as drawbacks.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-corcoran\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Corcoran</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers a more modern and scalable approach to real estate with attractive commission splits, lower fees, and more income opportunities through its revenue share program. Agents seeking long-term growth and financial security will find Real Broker’s structure more appealing.</p>\n<p>Corcoran, on the other hand, may be a better fit for agents focused on the luxury market who value brand recognition over maximizing their earnings. However, the absence of additional income opportunities and a production cap may limit the appeal for agents seeking to grow their wealth over time.</p>\n<p>For more information, explore our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to get a clearer understanding of which brokerage is right for you.

    "slug": "fathom-vs-century-21",

    "content": "<p>If you&#8217;re deciding between Fathom Realty and Century 21, you&#8217;re essentially choosing between profitability and brand tradition. Fathom offers agents a lean, commission-first model with no royalty fees, while Century 21 trades on its decades of name recognition and structured systems—but with costs that can significantly cut into your income. Both models have their place, but the best choice depends on whether you value financial freedom or the perceived advantages of a legacy brand.</p>\n<p>This side-by-side comparison breaks down what each brokerage brings to the table when it comes to commission structures, income opportunities, training, tech, and agent satisfaction—so you can confidently choose what aligns best with your goals.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty gives agents full commission retention with its 100/0 model. Agents don’t pay franchise or royalty fees, and there’s no cap to reach or maintain. The only ongoing costs are a flat $700 annual fee and per-transaction charges ranging between $165 and $465. These costs don’t change based on production level, which makes the model both simple and predictable. For agents who close regularly, this can mean tens of thousands more kept per year.</p>\n<p>Century 21 takes a more traditional approach. Commission splits typically range between 70/30 and 92/8 depending on performance and office agreements. However, even after reaching a $22,500 cap, agents continue paying an 8% franchise fee—permanently. Monthly office fees vary by location and can range from zero to $350, and while transaction fees are often built into that structure, the ongoing franchise fee alone can add up fast and seriously reduce take-home earnings.</p>\n<p>Agents focused on long-term income retention typically lean toward Fathom’s flat-fee setup, while those who prioritize affiliation with a globally recognized brand often consider Century 21 despite the higher overhead.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty sticks to commission-only earnings. There’s no revenue share, retirement plan, or willable income pathway. While the 100% model helps agents maximize income on every deal, there are no built-in opportunities to scale earnings beyond personal production. For agents who are looking to sell, close, and collect without additional layers, this setup is straightforward—but limited.</p>\n<p>Century 21 doesn’t offer additional income streams either. There’s no formal revenue share system, equity opportunities, or retirement structure, and no financial benefit to recruiting other agents. Like Fathom, your income at Century 21 is tied entirely to what you close. The difference is that franchise fees eat into that commission every step of the way, reducing profitability without offering any passive upside.</p>\n<p>As agent expectations evolve, more professionals are seeking models that reward team-building, mentorship, and production with extra income layers—something neither Fathom nor Century 21 currently delivers.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty takes a low-intervention approach to agent development. There is no formal training system in place, and agents do not have access to 24/7 support. This hands-off model can work well for experienced agents with their own resources but poses a challenge for anyone looking for mentorship, team guidance, or transaction support.</p>\n<p>Century 21 offers a more structured—but inconsistent—training model. The quality and availability of training resources vary widely from office to office. Some locations offer strong mentorship and onboarding, while others provide only basic onboarding materials and outdated workshops. Like Fathom, there is no companywide 24/7 agent support, which can leave agents scrambling during fast-moving negotiations or weekend offers.</p>\n<p>For agents who already know how to navigate the real estate process, both models offer autonomy. But for those seeking accountability and growth through consistent training, the lack of reliable coaching and accessible support makes both brokerages feel limited.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty allows agents the freedom to use whichever tools work best for their business. The brokerage does not offer a proprietary CRM or integrated marketing platform, which gives agents flexibility—but also means they’re responsible for building and maintaining their tech stack from scratch. For seasoned agents with proven systems, this freedom is a plus. For newer agents, it can feel like being left to figure it all out alone.</p>\n<p>Century 21 does offer a suite of tech tools that includes CRM systems, marketing platforms, and brand-backed resources. However, like its training model, the strength of those tools depends on the office. Some locations provide excellent support and digital infrastructure, while others fall short, leaving agents with inconsistent access to the tools they need to scale.</p>\n<p>In both models, the burden of business-building still largely falls on the agent. The question is whether you prefer full control over your tech stack with Fathom—or a franchise model that might offer tools, but not always at the level you expect.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty maintains a 4.6 out of 5 rating on Glassdoor, with hundreds of agents praising its low-cost model and high level of autonomy. Many agents highlight the simplicity of the 100% commission structure as a major benefit, though some note that the lack of hands-on support or team-building opportunities can create a ceiling for those who want to scale or grow in a collaborative environment.</p>\n<p>Century 21 has a 4.2 rating, based on more than 1,500 reviews. Agents appreciate the brand recognition and enjoy the access to a wide referral network. But concerns often focus on the high franchise fees, the variation in office culture, and the uneven quality of training and technology. For some, the brand association alone isn’t enough to justify the ongoing financial and operational trade-offs.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages offer independence—but neither delivers the complete combination of scalability, income variety, and mentorship that today’s high-performing agents are actively seeking.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Century 21</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is ideal for experienced agents who are focused on maximizing take-home pay and minimizing overhead. If you don’t need training, support, or tech and want the simplest model possible, Fathom lets you keep more of what you earn—no strings attached.</p>\n<p>Century 21 appeals to agents who value legacy branding and want to benefit from an established referral network. But the ongoing 8% franchise fee and high caps can chip away at earnings fast, and inconsistent training and tools mean not every agent receives the same level of support.</p>\n<p>Neither model offers a revenue share, stock equity, or scalable passive income path. For agents looking to build more than just a solo sales career, that absence is becoming harder to overlook.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>This comparison between Real vs Douglas Elliman highlights the key differences in commission structures, fees, and opportunities for agents to build long-term wealth. Both brokerages offer distinct approaches, making them suitable for different agent needs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Douglas Elliman</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers commission splits ranging from 85/15 to 100/0, with no franchise or royalty fees. The production cap is set at $12K, and agents have the potential to earn a top agent bonus of $24K. Monthly fees are affordable at $750 per year, and transaction fees are waived until the cap is reached, making Real Broker a cost-effective option for agents.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, on the other hand, has commission splits between 50/50 and 70/30, which are much lower than Real Broker’s top splits. Douglas Elliman also charges a 6% franchise/royalty fee, further reducing the agent’s overall earnings. Unlike Real Broker, there is no production cap, meaning agents continue to split their commissions with the brokerage indefinitely. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty structure, offering some predictability but at a higher cost.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker excels in income opportunities by offering a revenue share program, which allows agents to earn passive income by recruiting new agents. This revenue share, along with Real Broker&#8217;s retirement income path and willable income options, makes it a great option for agents focused on long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman does not offer additional income streams such as revenue sharing, retirement income, or willable income. Agents at Douglas Elliman rely solely on commission income, limiting their ability to build wealth beyond sales.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides robust training with 30+ live training sessions per week and 24/7 agent support, giving agents access to resources whenever they need them. This is an excellent option for agents who want continuous development and immediate support.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman’s training varies by office, meaning agents may experience inconsistencies in the quality of training offered. The brokerage does not provide 24/7 agent support, which could be a drawback for agents who need assistance outside of traditional working hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers modern, cloud-based technology tools designed to streamline the agent’s work, including CRM systems and marketing platforms. These tools provide flexibility and efficiency, helping agents manage their business from anywhere.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, while offering good branding and marketing resources for agents focused on high-end properties, may not offer the same level of tech-driven tools as Real Broker. The technology at Douglas Elliman is geared more toward luxury real estate marketing rather than the cloud-based efficiency provided by Real Broker.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker has a Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews, with agents praising the transparent fee structure and additional income opportunities. The support system and modern technology are also highly rated by agents.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman holds a 3.9-star rating from 638 reviews. While the brokerage is recognized for its luxury market focus and brand reputation, agents often raise concerns about the lower commission splits and high fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Douglas Elliman</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers more agent-friendly commission splits, lower fees, and significant income opportunities through its revenue share model, retirement path, and willable income options. Agents looking for a modern, flexible brokerage with long-term financial potential will find Real Broker a better fit.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman is ideal for agents targeting the luxury market, but the higher fees, lower commission splits, and absence of additional income streams may limit its appeal for those looking to maximize their earnings.</p>\n<p>For more information, explore our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to get a clearer understanding of which brokerage is right for you.

    "content": "<p>When comparing Fathom vs Coldwell Banker, agents will notice stark differences in commission structures, fees, and income opportunities, which can heavily influence their choice depending on career goals and financial priorities.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-realty-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs Coldwell Banker</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a 100/0 commission split, which means agents keep 100% of their commissions, with no franchise or royalty fees. There is no production cap, making it a straightforward model where agents pay an annual fee of $700 and transaction fees ranging from $150 to $250 per transaction. This makes Fathom a highly appealing option for agents who want to retain the bulk of their earnings without ongoing costs.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker, on the other hand, has commission splits starting at 55/45 and going up to 90/10, which means agents take home less compared to Fathom’s 100%. Additionally, Coldwell Banker charges a franchise/royalty fee of 5% to 6.5%, further reducing agents&#8217; earnings. Coldwell Banker does not have a production cap either, so agents continue to split commissions and pay royalty fees regardless of their earnings. Monthly fees at Coldwell Banker range from $150 to $179, and transaction fees are included in the royalty fee, which adds some predictability but at a higher cost.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty does not offer additional income streams such as revenue share, retirement income paths, or willable income options. Agents rely entirely on their commission-based income, which can be limiting for those looking to build passive income.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker similarly does not provide revenue share or retirement income opportunities, leaving agents to rely solely on commissions. Neither brokerage offers the ability to earn passive or residual income.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty provides no formal training or 24/7 agent support, which could be a limitation for newer agents or those who require more hands-on assistance. However, the low-cost model and full commission retention may appeal to experienced agents who are already established and require minimal support.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers training that varies by office, which can lead to inconsistencies in quality. There is no 24/7 agent support, meaning agents may need to rely on local office resources for assistance outside of standard working hours. However, Coldwell Banker’s established brand and broader network may offer some informal mentorship opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty uses a tech-driven platform that helps agents streamline their transactions and marketing. Although it may not have the extensive brand power of Coldwell Banker, Fathom’s use of technology helps agents manage their work more independently.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker provides agents with solid technology tools, including CRM and marketing resources, but the level of technology support varies by office. As a more traditional brokerage, Coldwell Banker may not offer the same modern, cloud-based solutions that Fathom’s model is built upon.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty boasts a 4.6-star Glassdoor rating from 425 reviews, where agents frequently praise the 100% commission model and the simplicity of the fee structure. However, some agents mention the lack of training and support as a potential downside.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker has a 4.3-star rating from 2.6K reviews. Agents appreciate the brand recognition and support in certain markets but express concerns about the high fees and lower commission splits compared to newer models like Fathom.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-realty-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs Coldwell Banker</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a great option for agents who want to maximize their commission with minimal fees. Its straightforward 100% commission model and low transaction fees make it appealing for independent, experienced agents. However, the lack of training and passive income opportunities may be a downside for agents who want more comprehensive support.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers brand prestige, but with higher fees, lower commission splits, and no additional income streams, it may not appeal to agents who prioritize income retention. However, agents who value the brand’s reputation and broad network might find Coldwell Banker a better fit.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.
