Traditional brick-and-mortar brokerages don’t run as efficiently because of their high cost of maintaining local office space and many layers of franchise owners.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty is the only large brokerage that has been cumulatively profitable in the past several years. eXp can afford to improve agent earnings while other brokerages <a href=\"https://esquirereb.com/compass-next-victim-real-estate-business-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decrease what agents earn.</a> Also, eXp Realty has been on <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-eXp-Realty-EI_IE907965.11,21.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor’s best companies</a> to work at for the last 8 years.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s dive into the pros and cons of joining eXp Realty for new brand agents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pros-of-joining-exp-realty-for-new-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Structural Advantages Available To New Agents At eXp Realty</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-100percent-commission-payout-possibility\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. 100% Commission Payout Possibility</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional brokerages told me new agents get anywhere from a 70/30 payout split to a 60/40 payout split (actually 64/36 and 54/44 because they didn’t deduct their 6% fee.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_1.webp\" alt=\"Illustration of diverse agents celebrating growth and opportunity at eXp Realty, with a flourishing plant and rising financial charts.\" class=\"wp-image-3922 size-full\" width=\"896\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_1.webp 896w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_1-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 896px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty’s payout split can be more than 100% of an agent’s commissions. All agents start with an 80/20 split (a real one, there’s no hidden 6% broker fee). One exception &#8211; brand new agents earn 60/40 for their first 3 transactions while they are in eXp’s mentorship program (more on the mentorship program below).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once an agent pays eXp $16,000 from their earned commissions (about $2.65 million in gross sales at 3% commission), the agent is considered “capped” that year and then the agent earns 100% of their commissions for the rest of their calendar year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-extensive-free-agent-training\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Extensive FREE Agent Training</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New agents at traditional brokerages often rely on one broker in their office to answer all their questions. A broker told me that I should buy expensive ($2000 or more) training classes to “learn” how to get leads and clients and make a commission.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp’s training extends well beyond the support offered by a single broker. eXp has 3 primary training opportunities: 1. On-boarding videos and webinars directed at helping new agents get leads, clients, and commission as fast as possible, 2. 60+ hours of live training classes available each week, and those same training classes are recorded and available on-demand if a new agent can’t make the live training. 3. Sponsorship groups incentivized to offer additional training classes to agents. These sponsorship groups run 7 tiers deep, creating a deep support system for new agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-low-agent-fees-and-costs\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Low Agent Fees and Costs</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional brokerages have so many fees: a 6% fee paid from gross commission on each transaction; a fee of $2000+ for E&amp;O insurance due at the beginning of each year; $100s in monthly desk fees and/or franchise fees. Also, at most traditional brokerages, agents must purchase their website and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/484fd15d157b2547-Low-Costs.webp/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3947 size-full\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Low-Costs.webp 500w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Low-Costs-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty has no desk fees, no franchise fees, and no royalty fees. New agents pay $149 their first month at eXp and then just $85 a month thereafter. Additionally, that low monthly fee includes a personalized IDX website, a top industry CRM with lead generation tools (one that other agents pay $6000 a year for), access to Regus Business Lounges (yep, eXp does have office space), ongoing live training, and much more.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also, at eXp E&amp;O insurance fees are much lower &#8211; $60 paid from each commission and it caps at $750 annually. Last, eXp agents pay $25 for broker review from each commission. </p>\n<h3 id=\"4-superior-support-with-exp-world-and-mentors\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Superior Support with eXp World &amp; Mentors</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To get new agent questions answered, traditional brokerages told me “go to your office broker to ask your questions”. Wow, agents have to rely on the knowledge and availability of just one person?</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty has over 2000 salaried employees in eXp World (their cloud-based office) to help answer questions and solve problems. Some employees are available 24-7.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, eXp Realty has a mentorship program for brand-new agents. New agents are assigned a mentor who has been qualified by eXp. </p>\n<h3 id=\"5-seven-tier-sponsorship-groups-can-provide-top-value\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Seven-Tier Sponsorship Groups Can Provide Value</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty&#8217;s has unique 7-tier sponsorship groups that set it apart from other real estate brokerages. These groups offer agents incredible advantages in 2 ways.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty allows agents to participate in optional revenue share programs funded by company dollar rather than agent commissions. Participation is not required, and sponsor involvement, training, and systems vary widely depending on the sponsor selected. This revenue share income can continue when an agent retires and it’s willable too.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Because sponsorship groups only profit when agents earn commissions (sponsors are paid from the 20% eXp makes before an agent caps), sponsors are incentivized to help agents succeed both in their production and in bringing in new agents to the company.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More robust sponsorship teams offer training, support, and several weekly video calls that help agents earn more commissions and revenue share income. These calls also create community. </p>\n<h3 id=\"6-innovative-technology-and-virtual-tools\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Innovative Technology and Virtual Tools</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DA767B_1.webp\" alt=\"Real estate agents immersed in high-tech virtual reality environments, showcasing eXp Realty&#039;s innovative tools.\" class=\"wp-image-3920 size-full\" width=\"896\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DA767B_1.webp 896w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DA767B_1-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 896px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In today&#8217;s digital age, having access to innovative technology and virtual tools is essential for success in real estate. eXp Realty offers cutting-edge tools and training that are expanding all the time.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, eXp Realty has eXp World, IDX websites, Skyslope to easily complete transactions, a CRM that includes lead generation tools, a marketing center with customizable marketing materials, and so much more.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"7-access-to-huge-network-of-experienced-agents-across-different-markets\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Access to Huge Network of Experienced Agents Across Different Markets</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty’s huge network of over 80,000 agents offers invaluable opportunities for learning, collaboration, and referrals. That along with eXp’s culture of sharing allows new agents to connect with experienced agents to tap into their training expertise and gain valuable insights to navigate challenges and earn more commissions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-work-from-anywhere-anytime-with-virtual-support-systems\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Work from Anywhere, Anytime with Virtual Support Systems</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty’s virtual work environment provides the flexibility to work from anywhere at any time. No eXp agent is confined by traditional office hours or geographic limitations. eXp Realty’s virtual support systems ensure agents have all the tools and resources needed for digital-age success.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-brand-new-agents-can-be-more-efficient-with-new-tech-tools\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Brand New Agents Can Be More Efficient with New Tech tools</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp has many advanced technology tools that other brokerages don’t have. Brand new agents are even more poised to take advantage of these tools than experienced agents who leave another brokerage and join eXp. That’s because experienced agents tend to keep doing what they were doing before they joined eXp and often they don’t learn to use the more efficient and effective tools that eXp offers. Brand new agents often make better use of Skyslope forms and their choice of CRM (BoldTrail, Lofty, or Cloze).</p>\n<h3 id=\"10-affordable-healthcare\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Affordable Healthcare</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although healthcare is not free at eXp, most brokerages have no healthcare options. eXp Realty offers access to group healthcare options, which may cost less and provide more coverage compared to options available through other brokerages or independent plans.</p>\n<h3 id=\"11-exp-luxury-launched\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. eXp Luxury Launched</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sothebys, The Agency, and Compass no longer have the best marketing. eXp Luxury advertises luxury homes in the best of the best publications, translates listings into different languages, and offers global exposure for luxury listings. Plus, members of eXp Luxury get four monthly training calls offering top tips and training classes for our luxury agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-exp-centralized-a-referral-division\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. eXp Centralized a Referral Division</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With over 80,000+ agents all around the world, referrals are BIG business. eXp has made referrals easy with a centralized hub. A few clicks on a form and referral paperwork is all done. For agents choosing to only provide referrals to earn commissions, eXp has made it so those agents no longer have to pay their MLS and Realtor association fees.</p>\n<h3 id=\"13-exp-commercial-real-estate-division\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. eXp Commercial Real Estate Division</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s right! Commercial agents get all the same great features and benefits that eXp offers. At eXp Realty, agents have lots of choices of how to earn an income.</p>\n<h3 id=\"14-exp-has-extensive-vendor-partners\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. eXp has Extensive Vendor Partners</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While sponsors often use the term “partner with me”, <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-partners-rebranded-exp-solutions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vendor partners</a> refers to the vendors that eXp Realty has relationships with that bring services to eXp agents. The sheer size of eXp Realty with over 88,000 agents worldwide provides bargaining power for eXp to bring the best to agents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cons-of-joining-exp-realty-for-new-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Tradeoffs New Agents Should Evaluate At eXp Realty</h2>\n<h3 id=\"?\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3923\" src=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_2.webp\" alt=\"Agents navigating through a maze against a backdrop of skyscrapers, symbolizing the challenges faced by new agents at eXp Realty.\" width=\"896\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_2.webp 896w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_2-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 896px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</h3>\n<h3 id=\"1-missed-opportunity-when-new-agent-chooses-the-wrong-sponsor\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Missed Opportunity When New Agent Chooses the “Wrong” Sponsor</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some agents join eXp Realty without naming a sponsor and others join sponsorship groups that don’t provide the value needed for that agent. It’s important for new agents to research the sponsorship groups so they won’t miss out on training, support, guidance, or resources that could have helped them thrive in their real estate careers.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Note, that agents cannot easily change sponsorship groups. To change groups, an agent must leave eXp for at least 6 months and then rejoin the company.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-revenue-share-challenges-for-new-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Revenue Share Challenges for New Agents</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some agents become discouraged when trying to bring more agents into eXp and they may struggle to build income through attracting recruits. Joining a sponsorship group with revenue share training brings more success to agents seeking revenue share this income.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-lack-of-on-site-broker-guidance-may-be-hard-for-new-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Lack of On-Site Broker Guidance May be Hard for New Agents</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty doesn’t maintain traditional brick-and-mortar offices. While the flexibility to work anytime from anywhere appeals to many agents, it may not suit everyone&#8217;s preferences or needs.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Working remotely requires a high level of self-motivation and discipline, especially when it comes to training and doing the day-to-day activities necessary to succeed in the real estate business. While some agents thrive in this setting, others may struggle to stay focused and productive without the structure of a traditional office environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-almost-too-much-support-and-training-for-new-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.

If a new agent joins eXp with a sponsor who doesn’t help an agent navigate it all, the agent may feel lost and unsure about what steps to take next in their training.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"5-lead-generation-new-agents-need-to-learn-how\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Considerations For New Agents Operating Within eXp Realty’s Model</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-research-and-choose-the-right-sponsorship-group\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Research &amp; Choose the Right Sponsorship Group</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It&#8217;s crucial to evaluate potential sponsorship groups. Each group has its own unique culture, support system, and resources that can greatly impact your success. Look for a group that aligns with your values and goals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-embrace-additional-value-offered-by-exp\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Embrace Additional Value Offered by eXp</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, new agents can access additional value beyond traditional real estate brokerage services. Take full advantage. eXp University provides comprehensive training resources. Utilize it by checking the weekly course and attending the courses that suit your needs.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, if your sponsorship group offers mastermind video calls, attend the calls. These calls will get you “plugged in” for success while fostering relationships with other agents, and creating a supportive community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-leverage-modern-marketing-strategies\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.

When selecting a sponsorship group, prioritize those offering modern marketing strategy training.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"4-seek-guidance-from-experienced-mentors\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Seek Guidance from Experienced Mentors</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New agents at eXp are assigned a mentor for the agent’s first three transactions. Mentors offer advice and direction on lead generation, negotiation tactics, and market trends, as well as transactions. Actively engage with them, ask questions, and soak up their wisdom to enhance your chances of success.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-utilize-exp-world-for-support\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Utilize eXp World for Support</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp World is an immersive virtual platform that allows agents to connect with colleagues worldwide and to get questions answered and problems solved. Take a tour of eXp World. Go to your state brokerage for production issues, go to tech help for any tech issues, and go to agent support for questions surrounding onboarding. Visit the self-help areas and visit the eXp partner booths.

Agents needing constant in-person supervision may struggle more than those comfortable with structured programs and self-directed learning environments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-realty-a-realistic-option-for-brand-new-agents-with-no-experience-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What replaces the traditional office experience for new agents at eXp?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, physical offices are replaced by live virtual training, certified mentors, broker access, and cloud-based collaboration. New agents learn through scheduled classes and systems rather than informal office drop-ins, changing how support and relationships are built early on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-realty-a-realistic-option-for-brand-new-agents-with-no-experience-1-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who tends to struggle most as a new agent at eXp Realty?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New agents who rely heavily on in-person oversight or expect brokerage staff to manage their daily business may struggle more at eXp. The model favors agents who ask questions, attend training consistently, and take responsibility for engaging with available systems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"making-an-informed-decision-about-joining-exp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty for new agents is designed to address startup cost, access to training, early transaction support, and scalability, but it does not operate in isolation or replace the broader brokerage experience.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Large group photo of smiling eXp Realty agents from Smart Agent Alliance and The Wolf Pack, celebrating together at an event.\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-980x194.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-480x95.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fa-qs\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">FAQs</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713729116604\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What kind of training does eXp Realty provide for new agents?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>eXp Realty provides live virtual classes, on-demand education, onboarding sessions, and mentor-guided transaction support. Training covers contracts, lead generation, negotiations, marketing, and compliance, allowing new agents to learn continuously without relying on a single office broker.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713729121719\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Can new agents join eXp Realty part-time?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. eXp Realty allows agents to operate part-time or full-time. Training, broker access, and systems are available regardless of schedule, making it possible for agents to transition gradually while balancing other work, though production speed will vary accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713729133341\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is eXp Realty suitable for experienced agents as well as new agents?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. While this article focuses on new agents, eXp Realty also supports experienced agents, teams, and broker-owners. Capped commissions, lower overhead, and optional revenue share often appeal to seasoned professionals seeking scalability and long-term income diversification.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713729168986\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Should a new agent choose a local sponsor at eXp Realty?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Not necessarily. Mentorship is handled separately through local certified mentors. Sponsor value depends on training, systems, and accountability rather than geography. Many effective sponsor teams operate nationally or globally, offering broader experience and resources than local proximity alone.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"related-e-xp-realty-fit-guides\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related eXp Realty Fit Guides</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">New-agent decisions intersect with other Fit-stage considerations already covered in this pillar:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/vs-traditional-new-agents\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty vs Traditional Brokerages for New Agents: Which is Better?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/exp-realty-sponsor/30-hour-realtor-week\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">30-Hour Realtor Week: How to End Burnout and Reclaim Time</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/exp-realty-sponsor/brokerage-culture-growth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Does Brokerage Culture Kill or Accelerate Growth</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
