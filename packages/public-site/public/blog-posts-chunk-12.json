A checklist keeps you from missing critical details, ensures you look polished, and makes the seller feel like they’re in the hands of a professional. Think of it like packing for a big trip &#8211; you don’t want to show up at the airport without your passport, right? Your checklist is your passport to winning more listings.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/78194e430073e735-Listing-Checklist-Why-a-Checklist-is-a-Game-Changer.webp/public\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Why a Checklist is a Game Changer\" class=\"wp-image-267739 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Why-a-Checklist-is-a-Game-Changer.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Why-a-Checklist-is-a-Game-Changer-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-prepare-for-the-appointment\">How to Prepare for the Appointment</h2>\n<p>Winning the listing starts <em>before</em> you knock on the door. Prep like a pro, or risk looking like an amateur. Here’s how to make sure you’re locked, loaded, and ready to impress.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gather-essential-documents\">Gather Essential Documents</h3>\n<p>Nothing kills credibility faster than shuffling through your bag looking for a missing form. Plan to have your listing agreement, seller disclosures, and any required documents ready to go &#8211; neatly organized, digital or printed. Bonus points for a sleek presentation folder.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"analyze-market-comparables\">Analyze Market Comparables</h3>\n<p>Sellers want numbers, not guesswork. Do a solid Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) and plan to show them where their home stands in the market. For a step-by-step guide on creating an <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/sales-marketing/seven-steps-for-creating-a-useful-cma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">effective CMA, refer to the National Association of REALTORS®&#8217; resource</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/1146ae60acb0e947-Listing-Checklist-Analyze-Market-Comparables.webp/public\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Analyze Market Comparables\" class=\"wp-image-267741 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Analyze-Market-Comparables.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Analyze-Market-Comparables-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>?Use recent sales, active listings, and expired listings to back up your pricing strategy. But plan to hold your final price until after you see the home and after the seller tells you what THEY think their home is worth. Then you’ll know what you’re dealing with as far as seller expectations go.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"understand-the-sellers-needs\">Understand the Seller’s Needs</h3>\n<p>Not all sellers are the same. Some want top dollar, some need a quick sale, and some just want an agent who will <em>actually</em> answer their calls. Plan to ask questions that will pull out what they want, and then tailor your approach to their priorities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"identify-communication-preferences\">Identify Communication Preferences</h3>\n<p>If you’re a great agent, you’ll be communicating frequently and regularly with your clients.  So, plan to ask how they want that communication to happen. Some clients love phone calls, others only want texts or emails. Get clear on how they prefer to communicate and respect that &#8211; it makes working together a whole lot smoother.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-a-standout-listing-presentation\">Create a Standout Listing Presentation</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Plan a listing presentation that will be clear, engaging, and to the point, and keep it short and visually appealing. Nobody wants a 45-minute PowerPoint. Bring printed materials or a slick digital version they can reference. And, hey, by the way, we at Smart Agent Alliance provide a great digital listing presentation, one that you can easily customize as your own, when you join Exp Realty and name us as your sponsor.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a9dd05763f53841b-Listing-Checklist-Create-a-Standout-Listing-Presentation.webp/public\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Create a Standout Listing Presentation\" class=\"wp-image-267736 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Create-a-Standout-Listing-Presentation.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Create-a-Standout-Listing-Presentation-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"running-the-appointment-like-a-pro\">Running the Appointment Like a Pro</h2>\n<p>Alright, you’re in the door. Now what?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"first-impressions-matter\">First Impressions Matter</h3>\n<p>Smile. Make eye contact. Be confident. If you fumble your introduction, you’ll spend the rest of the appointment trying to recover. So practice if you need to and, of course, be interested in their home and confident about selling it. And, remember, no one wants to hire an agent who points out all the home&#8217;s negatives. That just makes the seller think that you’re not the right agent to put the positive spin on it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"present-market-insights-like-a-boss\">Present Market Insights Like a Boss</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Sellers don’t care about <em>your</em> opinion &#8211; they care about <em>facts</em>. So, you already did your pricing homework.  Now bring charts, graphs, and data to back up your pricing recommendations. Make it visual and easy to understand. And if they hit you with the dreaded “I want to price it higher than that” objection? Show them the expired listings and explain why overpricing is the fastest way to <em>not</em> sell a house.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/42c3a3fe021c5087-Listing-Checklist-Present-Market-Insights-Like-a-Boss.webp/public\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Present Market Insights Like a Boss\" class=\"wp-image-267737 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Present-Market-Insights-Like-a-Boss.webp 498w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Present-Market-Insights-Like-a-Boss-300x172.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"handle-objections-before-they-come-up\">Handle Objections Before They Come Up</h3>\n<p>Expect objections and be ready with solid responses. If they push back on commission, break down the value you bring. If they’re hesitant to list right away, discuss market trends and timing strategies. The Mike Ferry Organization offers a <a href=\"https://assets-prod.mikeferry.com/main/files/40RealEstateObjectionsHandled.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comprehensive list of 40 real estate objections</a> and how to handle them.</p>\n<p>The key? Stay calm, confident, and solution-focused.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"outline-your-marketing-strategy\">Outline Your Marketing Strategy</h3>\n<p>Here’s where you show them why <em>you</em> are the best agent for the job. Explain your marketing plan &#8211; professional photos, social media ads, virtual tours, open houses. Show them real examples of how you market homes. For inspiration, explore these <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-plan/real-estate-marketing-plan-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate marketing plan examples</a> from industry leaders.</p>\n<p>If another agent is promising the world, remind them that flashy talk is easy; <em>proven</em> results are what matter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"practicing-and-role-playing\">Practicing and Role-Playing</h2>\n<p>Hey, if you don’t feel like you&#8217;re ready to conquer the appointment, even the best agents practice. If you haven’t role-played a listing appointment before, now’s the time.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-role-playing-works\">Why Role-Playing Works</h3>\n<p>Ever heard of muscle memory? Practicing responses to objections makes them second nature. That way, when a seller asks a tough question, you won’t freeze up – instead, you’ll deliver a smooth, confident response.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"be-ready-for-common-objections\">Be Ready for Common Objections</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The Seller says, “I think my home is worth more.” You say, “I totally understand, and I want to get you the best price possible. Let’s look at what buyers are actually paying in your area so we can price it right and get it sold fast.”  Or the seller says, “Another agent said they’d do it for a lower commission.”  You say: “That’s great! But do they offer the same level of marketing and negotiation expertise? The right agent makes you more money, not just saves you a little upfront.”</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cc2168d155e9368e-Listing-Checklist-Be-Ready-for-Common-Objections.webp/public\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Be Ready for Common Objections\" class=\"wp-image-267742 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Be-Ready-for-Common-Objections.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Be-Ready-for-Common-Objections-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nail-the-tough-questions\">Nail the Tough Questions</h3>\n<p>If you can answer these questions without hesitation, you’re in good shape:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What makes you different from other agents?</li>\n<li>How will you market my home?</li>\n<li>What happens if my home doesn’t sell?</li>\n<li>Why should I list with you today?  So, work on your answers to those!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spend some serious time determining what your answers will be to those questions.  That way, you won’t be caught off guard and instead will come off as the polished, experienced, professional that you are.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"follow-up-after-the-appointment\">Follow Up After the Appointment</h2>\n<p>Okay, the appointment is over. If you think you crushed the appointment, or even if you don’t think you did, don’t drop the ball.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"send-a-follow-up-thank-you\">Send a Follow-Up Thank You</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>A handwritten note or a personalized email goes a long way.

Keep the momentum going.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gather-feedback\">Gather Feedback</h3>\n<p>You can also ask them how they felt about the meeting. What questions do they still have?

It&#8217;s open to anyone in real estate who wants to learn, connect, and grow. You’ll get insider updates on eXp Realty’s growth, <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/brokerage-fee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tech tools</a>, and business model as showcased in <a href=\"https://expworldholdings.com/events-and-presentations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp World Holdings’ Events &amp; Presentations</a>. The EXPCON agenda includes everything from breakout sessions to keynotes from top producers to after-hours meetups that turn into mastermind sessions over margaritas.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a7c3737833170233-What-EXPCON-Actually-Is.webp/public\" alt=\"What EXPCON Actually Is\" class=\"wp-image-267577 size-full\" width=\"499\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/What-EXPCON-Actually-Is.webp 499w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/What-EXPCON-Actually-Is-480x272.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vendors and tech companies show up too, offering real-world tools, not just free pens and awkward sales pitches.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-should-go\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Should Go?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’re an eXp agent, this is your mothership calling. But EXPCON also welcomes brokers, industry experts, vendors, and real estate professionals curious about the best real estate brokerages, especially if you’re eyeing a move to a virtual real estate brokerage that actually works.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Newer agents? You’ll leave with tactical knowledge and a stack of contacts. Seasoned agents? You’ll sharpen your edge and pick up some gems along the way. Vendors? You’ll meet agents who actually use your tools (and aren’t afraid to tell you what they really think).</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-it-matters\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why It Matters</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This section explains why agents choose to attend eXp events, based on commonly reported experiences rather than guaranteed results. Think of EXPCON as your yearly shot of espresso for the soul and the spreadsheet. You’re not just sitting in chairs. You&#8217;re getting hands-on training, real-world examples, and the kind of networking that turns into referrals, partnerships, and revenue.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Learn what’s working right now in marketing, tech, social media, and <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/revenos-leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead gen</a>.</li>\n<li>Get behind-the-scenes access to eXp leadership’s vision and upcoming tools.</li>\n<li>Meet the faces behind the profile pics you&#8217;ve been chatting with in Workplace all year.</li>\n<li>Walk away with strategies, systems, and goals that don’t fizzle out by Monday.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-e-xp-realty-events-app-your-personal-guide-to-not-getting-lost\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The eXp Realty Events App: Your Personal Guide to Not Getting Lost</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you’ve ever fumbled through a 100-session conference with nothing but a paper map and vibes, you’ll love the eXp Realty Events App. It’s your sidekick for:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Customizing your EXPCON agenda and getting reminders before sessions start</li>\n<li>Messaging other attendees for quick connections or coffee meetups</li>\n<li>Scanning bios, workshop decks, and speaker updates on the fly</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Want to connect with a top producer or set up a post-event Zoom with a new referral partner?

Or maybe you just want more connection in between the big shows? That’s where eXp regional rallies come in.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These localized events offer a more intimate way for agents to plug into eXp’s culture without hopping on a cross-country flight. Whether it’s in Portland, Phoenix, or Peoria, regional events bring the energy of EXPCON to your backyard minus the long buffet lines and badge scanners.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They&#8217;re a key part of how eXp Realty fosters connection, learning, and collaboration on a hyper-local level. And yes, they’re still packed with value, insight, and people who get what it’s like to chase down appraisers and explain escrow in the same breath.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-the-point-of-these-regional-events\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s the Point of These Regional Events?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Simple: to build real community and offer boots-on-the-ground support where agents live and work.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp regional rallies give agents a space to trade market-specific tactics with people who understand their local pain points. Think less “generic real estate hype,” and more “here’s how I’m closing listings in this exact zip code.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 33%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>You’ll get:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Networking with agents you might actually see again (hello, referral network!)</li>\n<li>Training that’s tailored to your region’s quirks, competition, and client base</li>\n<li>Workshops led by agents who have actually <em>been there, done that</em>—and have the market share to prove it</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/671ec22bfc6fc595-Whats-the-Point-of-These-Regional-Events.webp/public\" alt=\"What’s the Point of These Regional Events\" class=\"wp-image-267578 size-full\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Point-of-These-Regional-Events.webp 500w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Point-of-These-Regional-Events-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether it’s pricing strategy for high desert homes or creative ways to market fixer-uppers during a rainy season, these regional convos are pure gold for real estate pros navigating their niche markets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-regional-events-matter-even-if-you-go-to-e-xpcon\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Regional Events Matter (Even If You Go to eXpcon)</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp regional events are more than just filler. They’re the connective tissue between the big ideas at EXPCON and your day-to-day grind. It’s like EXPCON hands you the strategy, and eXp regional rallies help you turn it into results.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:33% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/620c0e5d05c14c2c-Why-Regional-Events-Matter-Even-If-You-Go-to-eXpcon.webp/public\" alt=\"Why Regional Events Matter Even If You Go to eXpcon\" class=\"wp-image-267579 size-full\" width=\"499\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Why-Regional-Events-Matter-Even-If-You-Go-to-eXpcon.webp 499w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Why-Regional-Events-Matter-Even-If-You-Go-to-eXpcon-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also build pre-conference momentum. Some rallies offer sneak peeks at upcoming EXPCON themes, giving you a head start. Others let you dive deeper into past topics you wanted more time with, just in a smaller, more hands-on setting.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"real-estate-networking-minus-the-awkward-nametags\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Real Estate Networking, Minus the Awkward Nametags</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While EXPCON is the megaphone, eXp regional events are the campfire. You’ll still meet powerhouse agents and industry leaders, but you’ll also get face time with nearby colleagues who understand your market and speak your language.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that’s not just warm fuzzies. It’s referral-building, co-marketing potential, and real-deal support from people who want to see you win.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sponsor-team-meetups-like-a-family-reunion-but-with-less-potato-salad\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sponsor Team Meetups: Like a Family Reunion, But With Less Potato Salad</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s the thing about eXp Realty; it’s massive. Like, <em>“real estate agents on five continents”</em> is massive. But just like a big university splits into smaller clubs, sororities, or fantasy football leagues, eXp agents often find their home base in a sponsor team.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And that’s where sponsor events come in.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the more organized sponsor groups host their own in-person meetups to bring their agents together. These aren’t official eXp Realty events, but they’re one of the best-kept secrets of life at eXp. You get the global support of a top online real estate brokerage <em>and</em> the cozy camaraderie of a tight-knit team.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-happens-at-sponsor-events\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Happens at Sponsor Events?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Honestly? It depends on the group. Some do structured training sessions that go deeper than what you’ll find in eXp World. Others keep it casual: think hiking, dinners, coworking days, or just grabbing a drink with people who <em>actually</em> get your pain when a client ghost-texts you mid-contingency.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some sponsor teams meet on Zoom every week, so when we show up in person, it’s less “awkward handshake” and more “hug your accountability partner and swap listing war stories.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These events are designed to:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Build friendships that don’t feel like networking</li>\n<li>Strengthen your referral connections inside the team</li>\n<li>Learn, laugh, and maybe even vent a little with people who <em>get it</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"not-every-sponsor-does-this-but-the-good-ones-do\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Not Every Sponsor Does This—But the Good Ones Do</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s be real: most sponsors at eXp don’t organize local events or offer ongoing team connection. They bring you in and then it’s radio silence.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But a few sponsor teams treat this like a real commitment. They offer weekly masterminds, agent training, and occasional in-person meetups to make sure their agents are supported <em>beyond</em> the onboarding checklist.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So if you’re at one of those special teams? These sponsor meetups are your people-powered bonus. And if you&#8217;re not? It might be time to ask yourself if your “team” is just a name on paper.</p>\n<h2 id=\"local-agent-meetups-because-zoom-friends-are-even-better-in-real-life\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Local Agent Meetups: Because Zoom Friends Are Even Better in Real Life</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, agents are everywhere. But that doesn’t mean they’re working in silos. Thanks to the company&#8217;s “we’re-in-this-together” culture, many eXp agents take it upon themselves to create local connections, with or without a formal event invite.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3ba9c67412f1f4ff-Local-Agent-Meetups-Because-Zoom-Friends-Are-Even-Better-in-Real-Life.webp/public\" alt=\"Local Agent Meetups Because Zoom Friends Are Even Better in Real Life\" class=\"wp-image-267581 size-full\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Local-Agent-Meetups-Because-Zoom-Friends-Are-Even-Better-in-Real-Life.webp 500w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Local-Agent-Meetups-Because-Zoom-Friends-Are-Even-Better-in-Real-Life-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These real estate agent networking events might be as simple as coffee with colleagues or as organized as a standing monthly meetup. Some groups even host weekly Zoom calls, so by the time you meet face-to-face, you already know who loves scripts and who’s always multitasking with their mic off.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"why-do-agents-bother\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Do Agents Bother?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Simple: eXp Realty’s culture is built for collaboration, not competition. That tagline about being <a href=\"https://expworldholdings.com/press-releases/exp-realty-dominates-2025-realtrends-rankings-with-757-agents-and-teams-honored/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“the most agent-centric brokerage on the planet”</a>? It’s not just marketing fluff. When your brokerage actively encourages sharing, growth, and cross-market teamwork, local meetups happen organically.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Agents gather to:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Swap strategies, templates, and war stories</li>\n<li>Roleplay scripts or talk through tricky transactions</li>\n<li>Celebrate wins (and survive the occasional appraisal fail)</li>\n<li>Get that sense of team camaraderie minus the office drama</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sometimes these local events pop up around eXpcon or a regional rally, giving agents a chance to debrief, decompress, and dream big together. Other times, it’s just a Thursday coffee catch-up where someone casually drops a million-dollar idea.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-stage-no-sponsors-no-pressure\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">No Stage, No Sponsors, No Pressure</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What makes these local meetups special is that they’re grassroots. There’s no PowerPoint, and no guest speaker has flown in from corporate. It’s agents supporting agents. And in a virtual real estate brokerage, that kind of IRL connection can make a huge difference.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether you&#8217;re looking for tactical advice, referral partners, or just some humans who understand the chaos of back-to-back showings, local agent meetups give you a place to plug in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-also-ask-about-e-xp-realty-events\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About eXp Realty Events</h2>\n<h3 id=\"are-e-xp-realty-events-required-for-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are eXp Realty events required for agents?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. Attendance at eXp Realty events is optional. Agents choose which events to attend based on their goals, schedule, and learning preferences. Events are designed to add value through collaboration and education, not to impose participation requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-e-xp-events-compare-to-traditional-brokerage-conferences\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How do eXp events compare to traditional brokerage conferences?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp events tend to emphasize peer collaboration and real-world application rather than hierarchical presentations. Because agents already collaborate virtually year-round, in-person events often feel more relational and immediately productive than traditional office-based conferences.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-benefits-most-from-attending-e-xp-regional-rallies\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who benefits most from attending eXp regional rallies?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents who want localized insight and nearby referral relationships benefit most from regional rallies. These events are particularly useful for agents focused on market-specific strategy, pricing trends, and building professional connections within driving distance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-e-xp-realty-events-and-smart-agent-alliance-take-collaboration-to-the-next-level\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty events are designed to support collaboration, learning, and agent connection, but they do not operate in isolation or replace the broader brokerage experience.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core platform, including compliance, compensation, technology, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with and how much organized collaboration exists beyond brokerage-level resources.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b182ea753238642b-Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp/public\" alt=\"Team SAA - Smart Agent Alliance\" class=\"wp-image-267426 size-full\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp 499w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752698265958\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>What types of events does eXp Realty offer?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>eXp Realty offers national conferences like EXPCON, regional rallies, sponsor-led meetups, and informal local agent gatherings. Together, these events support education, collaboration, and relationship building across production levels and markets without requiring physical office attendance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752698380661\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Is EXPCON only for eXp Realty agents?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. While EXPCON is designed primarily for eXp agents, it is open to real estate professionals, brokers, and vendors interested in learning about eXp’s model, tools, and collaborative culture before making a brokerage decision.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752698392201\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Do all sponsor teams host events?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Most sponsor teams at eXp Realty do not host events or structured meetups. Sponsor-led collaboration varies significantly between groups. Some sponsors organize regular virtual or in-person gatherings, while others provide little ongoing engagement, which is why sponsor ecosystem evaluation matters for agents who value structured community.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752698404924\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Is there an app for eXp Realty events?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. The eXp Realty Events App helps attendees manage event participation by building personalized agendas, reviewing session details, accessing speaker information, and connecting with other agents. The app is commonly used during EXPCON and larger regional events to improve navigation, communication, and planning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"related-e-xp-realty-community-guides\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related eXp Realty Community Guides</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/collaborate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collaborate and Grow Faster at eXp Realty: Why Teamwork Wins Here</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/exp-realty-sponsor/need-community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Realtors Need Community (and How to Find the Right One)</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Basically, some companies like Compass want them, love them, and heavily promote their usage to their clients.  However, Zillow, eXp Realty, and other real estate industry companies are taking a stand against these listings. Before we dig into why that is, let’s get clear about the primary types of listings.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/75a2f7d11c389a4a-Whats-the-Issue.webp/public\" alt=\"What’s the Issue\" class=\"wp-image-267599 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Issue.webp 498w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Issue-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exclusive-private-listings\">Exclusive Private Listings</h3>\n<p>These live deep in the “If You Know, You Know” category. These off-market listings are only visible to the listing brokerage. No MLS. No yard sign. No Zillow. No other brokerages.  These listings are needed by some sellers for their privacy or safety.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coming-soon-listings\">Coming Soon Listings</h3>\n<p>These are like teaser trailers. Technically, Coming Soon homes are on the MLS, but they are not yet live for showings. Maybe the staging isn’t done, the dog’s still shedding all over the guest room, or hammers are still banging on the upgrades.  Coming soon listings are great for agents and their clients because they create a “heads up” to all brokerages and all agents so they know what’s coming soon to the market, giving everyone more time to prepare for their desired action.</p>\n<p>But whether these “Coming Soon” listings show up immediately on Zillow depends on the local MLSs.  For example, in Marin County, CA, “Coming Soon” homes are not released to Zillow until the listing goes “active,” &#8211; which could be up to 30 days.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"active-mls-listings\">Active MLS Listings</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/02d7511212aed287-Off-Market-Home-Sales-Active-MLS-Listings.webp/public\" alt=\"Off Market Home Sales, Active MLS Listings\" class=\"wp-image-267596 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Off-Market-Home-Sales-Active-MLS-Listings.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Off-Market-Home-Sales-Active-MLS-Listings-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Which brings us to Active Listings. They’re what most of us are here to do: get listings maximum exposure, get the best terms, and actually close deals. They’re the opposite of off-market listings—they’re visible to everyone, even  Zillow’s 3 a.m. scroll crowd.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exclusive-delayed-listings\">Exclusive “Delayed Listings”</h3>\n<p>And herein lies the center of the new real estate industry struggle.  These exclusive delayed listings have big “test balloon” energy.  They’re basically a “soft” open where the listing gets shown to the brokerage’s private network of agents and clients before going public. Brokerages like Compass push this strategy hard. Called <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/private-exclusives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">private exclusives</a>, they pitch it like it helps sellers test pricing or build buzz without the ding of MLS days on market or price drops.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-truth-about-on-exclusive-delayed-listings\">The Truth about Exclusive Delayed Listings</h2>\n<p>So, are exclusive delayed listings good for consumers?  For that answer, we can tap into a wealth of studies regarding exclusive listings. Let&#8217;s unpack the realities.?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"off-market-homes-often-sell-for-less\">Off-Market Homes Often Sell for Less</h3>\n<p>Research indicates that “<a href=\"https://cdn.bfldr.com/BI7DUWTF/at/tgpgnx62k9gs45963k24tg/Bright-Research-MLS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">office exclusives offer no price advantage</a>s over immediately promoting a home through the MLS”.  According to new <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/mls-pln-sale-price-34846/?fbclid=IwY2xjawIkYpFleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHbppzmcr7MH4uhTLPDt_BjFVElve1c_Mf3pLktqO3c_oE40rG3nn7jb14g_aem_c55ua33LyWDKlPuAUWdh9g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zillow research</a>, private home sales don&#8217;t necessarily equate to higher profits for sellers. In fact, homes sold off the MLS fetched nearly $5,000 less on average than those listed publicly. In California, that median loss jumped to over $30,000. Ouch.?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"longer-time-on-market\">Longer Time on Market</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Patience might be a virtue, but in real estate, time is money. Standard listings take a median of 20 days to sell, while exclusive listings linger for <a href=\"https://exptoolkit.com/sellers#seller-choice-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about 37 days</a>. That&#8217;s nearly double the time, potentially leading to increased holding costs and seller anxiety.?</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"497\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d6189519d2918098-Off-Market-Home-Sales-Longer-Time-on-Market.webp/public\" alt=\"Off Market Home Sales, Longer Time on Market\" class=\"wp-image-267597 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Off-Market-Home-Sales-Longer-Time-on-Market.webp 497w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Off-Market-Home-Sales-Longer-Time-on-Market-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"limited-exposure-hurts-buyers\">Limited Exposure Hurts Buyers</h3>\n<p>With private sale homes, many potential buyers remain unaware of available properties.

The temptation to prioritize personal gain over client interest becomes a real concern, potentially compromising the fiduciary duty owed to clients.?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-some-brokerages-are-obsessed-with-off-market-listings\">Why Some Brokerages Are Obsessed with Off-Market Listings</h2>\n<p>So if exclusive listings aren’t great for clients or consumers in general, why are some brokerages pushing exclusive delayed listings like it’s the smartest thing ever? The real reasons? Money. Control. And did we mention money?</p>\n<p>Here’s how the math works out in the exclusive delayed listings brokerage’s favor:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"double-dipping-commissions\">Double-Dipping Commissions</h3>\n<p>When a listing stays off the MLS and a home sells, that brokerage gets the commission from the seller and from the buyer. That’s double the commission, half the objections, and no outside brokerage cutting into the profits. Great for the brokerage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"recruiting-hook\">Recruiting Hook</h3>\n<p>Brokerages can use these private listings as a way to entice agents to join them.  They say “Hey, we’ve got off market listings you won’t find anywhere else.”  That talk gives agents the illusion of exclusivity—even when it’s just a private home sale pulled from a shared internal folder.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lead-hoarding\">Lead Hoarding</h3>\n<p>Brokerages can also get plenty of new buyer leads from these listings.  That is, if a listing doesn’t hit the MLS or Zillow, that brokerage controls every single buyer lead. They collect emails, phone numbers, and future business off the backs of their private listings.</p>\n<p>In the end, while off-market listings might offer a cloak of exclusivity, they&#8217;re all about increasing brokerage profits.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profit-needs\">Brokerage Profit Needs</h3>\n<p>And, don’t get us wrong…a lot of brokerages seriously need these extra profits. For example, take Compass, which has rebranded these exclusive delayed listings into a full-blown strategy, pitching them as a “sophisticated” way to test the market. Spoiler: it may be less strategy and more of a survival tactic.</p>\n<p>That’s because Compass, a publicly traded brokerage, has never had a profitable quarter. Not one.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"718\" height=\"409\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/71953bcc283446f1-image.png/public\" alt=\"Compass Earnings History\" class=\"wp-image-267590\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.png 718w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-300x171.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px\"></figure>\n<p>On the flip side? eXp Realty is the ONLY profitable brokerage in the past 5 years among all publicly-traded brokerages.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"732\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/68ea5d6667cdbb37-image-1.png/public\" alt=\"eXp World Holdings Earnings History\" class=\"wp-image-267591\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1.png 732w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1-300x176.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\"></figure>\n<p>Which might leave you thinking that Compass isn’t alone in being unprofitable.  That’s true, except Compass is dead last among all of them, and it’s not pretty. Compass’s earnings per share losses are more than twice as much as the number 2 loser, The Real Brokerage.  If you want to see all the earnings details, check out our blog on <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/profits\">Brokerage Profitability</a>. </p>\n<p>Bottom line: Compass needs a win, and it seems they have hung their hat here, on the pretend value of delayed exclusive listings. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>And guess what?  It may be working, well, sort of.  That is, reports say 55% of Compass’s February listings went the “private exclusive” route.

So much for exclusivity.

Platforms like Zillow make money by aggregating listings, putting them in front of buyers, and cashing in when someone clicks “Request a Tour.” That lead goes straight to a real estate agent who pays Zillow for the privilege. No listing? No lead. No profit.</p>\n<p>So Zillow drew a big, bold line in the sand. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zillow-fights-push-brokerages-real-estate-listings-more-exclusive-2025-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Starting May 1, 2025, Zillow’s making it official</a>.

While other brokerages stayed quiet, eXp took action to protect sellers by ensuring they fully understand the risks of going off-market.</p>\n<p>For years, many exclusive listings slipped through without confirming whether the seller actually understood the downsides. eXp changed that. With an <a href=\"https://cdn.bfldr.com/BI7DUWTF/at/s666742zf7ghjjg2mgqn9hc/Seller-Advisory-Risks-of-Limited-Market-Exposure-FORM-Version_R_USA_EN_04102025-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp exclusive advisory</a>, every seller considering a private listing with an eXp agent must acknowledge those risks, and in a show of leadership, eXp made their exclusive listing seller advisory publicly available to all brokerages, large or small.</p>\n<p>But they didn’t stop there. eXp has officially banned “delayed exclusive listings” across the board. If you’re an eXp agent, you play by the new rules—no exceptions.</p>\n<p>For those rare cases where confidentiality is critical, sellers still have a path.

Here’s what you need to know so you’re not caught flat-footed.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wont-zillow-ban-coming-soon-listings-that-are-delayed\">“Won’t Zillow Ban Coming Soon Listings That Are Delayed?”</h3>\n<p>Nope. Coming Soon listings aren’t the same as private exclusives. They’re fully MLS-sanctioned and visible to all agents and clients across brokerages. Think of them as a heads-up to the market—“Hey market, this home’s almost ready—hang tight.”  . <a href=\"https://www.realestatenews.com/2025/04/11/the-latest-on-zillows-new-listings-rules-as-2nd-brokerage-commits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Zillow rep said this complies with Zillow&#8217;s standards</a> as long as a Coming Soon listing is entered in the MLS and is displayable on all sites receiving a feed. When the MLS syndicates these listings, Zillow will show them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-if-a-listing-gets-banned-from-zillow\">“What Happens If a Listing Gets Banned from Zillow?”</h3>\n<p>If a listing gets banned under Zillow’s new rule, the property isn’t blacklisted forever, but the original brokerage is. According to Zillow’s Errol Samuelson, if the listing is &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.realestatenews.com/2025/04/11/the-latest-on-zillows-new-listings-rules-as-2nd-brokerage-commits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relisted with a different brokerage</a> and entered into the MLS within 24 hours of marketing, Zillow will display it.<br />Translation: if your brokerage messes up, the seller can fire you, relist with someone else, and still make it onto Zillow. But at that point, you’ve lost the listing, the client’s trust, and possibly your reputation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-there-still-be-off-market-private-listings\">“Will There Still Be Off-Market Private Listings?”</h3>\n<p>Yes—because sometimes privacy is the priority. Whether it’s a celebrity, a high-net-worth individual, or just someone who doesn’t want a sign in the yard or neighbors snooping, some sellers have no intention of going public. And, at eXp, sellers are fully informed of the tradeoffs. These homes aren’t meant for public marketing, and as long as the seller sticks to that plan, Zillow’s rule doesn’t apply.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-the-off-market-listing-battle-actually-matters\">Why the Off-Market Listing Battle Actually Matters</h2>\n<p>Off-market listings aren’t just a quirky tactic—they’ve become a flashpoint in real estate.

It’s only shown to a select group, typically within one brokerage’s network.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Do off-market listings sell for more money?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">No. According to Zillow data, off-market homes often sell for less, over $30,000 less in California alone.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Why do brokerages like Compass use delayed exclusive listings?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Delayed exclusives let brokerages control leads, double-dip commissions, and lure new agents with the promise of private inventory—even if it’s not in the seller’s best interest.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What is eXp Realty’s policy on off-market listings?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">eXp Realty bans delayed exclusive listings entirely and requires seller acknowledgment of risks for any true private listing. Transparency is non-negotiable.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Is Zillow banning Coming Soon listings?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Nope. Coming Soon listings are MLS-approved and visible to all agents. They’re not considered private exclusives and are allowed under Zillow’s rules.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

That’s exactly why <strong><a href=\"https://solutions.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Solutions</a></strong> exists.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of making agents fend for themselves, eXp Realty built a curated, plug-and-play system of top-tier tools, services, and real estate partners.

And because eXp is one of the <strong>top real estate brokerage firms</strong> with <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-earnings-q2-2023/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 87,000 agents</a>, the value received is no joke.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This page is the hub for our <strong>eXp Realty Solutions</strong> series.

Solutions such as Success Lending or Curbio are available as optional resources, but agents remain free to select outside lenders, contractors, transaction coordinators, or vendors that align with their specific business relationships and market conditions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752715045929\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What types of problems are eXp Solutions designed to address?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>eXp Solutions focus on common friction points in real estate, including healthcare access, pre-listing renovations, lending coordination, transaction support, office access, and vendor pricing. The purpose is to reduce overhead and simplify operations, not to standardize how agents must run their business.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1771026126858\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Do eXp Realty solutions change over time?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>eXp evaluates partnerships and agent needs on an ongoing basis. Solutions may be added, adjusted, or replaced as the brokerage grows and identifies new operational challenges. Because these programs are optional, changes do not disrupt an agent’s core brokerage relationship or required systems.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Instead of lumping everything into one generic portal, eXp splits its listings across four distinct platforms, each built for a specific purpose. Three are consumer-facing (national, luxury, and local agent sites), and one is exclusively for eXp agents to access private, off-market inventory.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b0fc4788b3324f5d-eXp-homes-for-sale-What-Are-eXp-Realty-Websites.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp homes for sale, What Are eXp Realty Websites\" class=\"wp-image-267554 size-full\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eXp-homes-for-sale-What-Are-eXp-Realty-Websites.webp 500w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eXp-homes-for-sale-What-Are-eXp-Realty-Websites-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This strategic setup gives agents multiple ways to showcase properties, attract clients, and build their brand, without paying extra for third-party tools. Let’s break down what each one offers:</p>\n<h3 id=\"e-xp-realty-national-listings\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">eXp Realty National Listings</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the main <a href=\"https://www.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty website</a>, featuring a comprehensive MLS-powered real estate listings search for buyers across the U.S. The national eXp Realty site functions as a centralized MLS-powered search platform that displays listings while preserving agent branding and lead routing.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every active MLS listing is pulled into one sleek interface, giving consumers a hassle-free way to find homes and giving agents a broader stage to promote their listings.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For agents, it’s a high-traffic national site that helps get listings maximum exposure while keeping your name front and center. The site pairs seamlessly with individual eXp agent sites, giving you tools to drive leads from your personal pages straight to your listings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"e-xp-luxury-listings-a-premium-experience-for-high-end-buyers\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">eXp Luxury Listings: A Premium Experience for High-End Buyers</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The eXp <a href=\"https://expluxury.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luxury website</a> caters exclusively to upscale properties, offering a polished, boutique-style experience that high-net-worth buyers expect. Listings are presented with elevated branding, curated design, and a tailored search interface that makes premium homes feel, well, premium.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ef9cc7527c38fbc1-eXp-Luxury-Listings-A-Premium-Experience-for-High-End-Buyers.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Luxury Listings A Premium Experience for High-End Buyers\" class=\"wp-image-267550 size-full\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eXp-Luxury-Listings-A-Premium-Experience-for-High-End-Buyers.webp 500w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eXp-Luxury-Listings-A-Premium-Experience-for-High-End-Buyers-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For agents, having your listings featured here means tapping into a market where presentation matters. It not only elevates your brand but positions you as a luxury expert. And if you&#8217;re part of eXp&#8217;s Luxury program, you&#8217;ll unlock specialized marketing materials, networking groups, and invite-only masterminds. Learn more about <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/luxury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Luxury for agents here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"agent-local-listings-via-free-idx-websites\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Agent Local Listings via Free IDX Websites</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Every eXp agent gets their own IDX website for realtors at no extra cost. These free IDX websites are fully customizable, packed with templates, widgets, and branding tools that let you stand out in your market.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike most brokerages where agents get stuck with a single bio page, <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/agent-website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp gives you a full-fledged website</a> where clients can search listings, sign up for alerts, and contact you directly. It’s a game-changing way to control your local online presence and keep leads in your orbit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"e-xp-exclusive-listings-off-market-access-on-point-advantage\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">eXp Exclusive Listings: Off-Market Access, On-Point Advantage</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Exclusives, powered by Zenlist, gives agents access to a private database of off-market real estate listings—the kind of homes you won’t find on Zillow or even in the local MLS. These listings live inside a mobile-first app that’s free for every eXp agent, with built-in tools for collaborating with clients and managing deals on the go.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This eXp-only portal is where you&#8217;ll find pre-market opportunities, investor-friendly flips, and homes that sellers don’t want on the MLS – all homes that are not advertised publicly. The platform is commonly used by agents working with buyers seeking off-market or pre-market inventory not publicly advertised.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0324d75475160af4-eXp-Exclusive-Listings-Off-Market-Access-On-Point-Advantage.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Exclusive Listings Off-Market Access, On-Point Advantage\" class=\"wp-image-267552 size-full\" width=\"499\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eXp-Exclusive-Listings-Off-Market-Access-On-Point-Advantage.webp 499w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eXp-Exclusive-Listings-Off-Market-Access-On-Point-Advantage-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zenlist access comes with the <a href=\"https://solutions.exprealty.com/us/zenlist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Starter Plan</a>, which includes collaboration with up to three client groups, MLS data, and the entire eXp Office Exclusive network. Upgrades are available if you want to go bigger, but even the free version is stacked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-e-xp-realty-websites-benefit-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How eXp Realty Websites Benefit Agents</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With four powerful platforms under one roof, eXp Realty websites do more than just showcase listings—they empower agents to run smarter, grow faster, and build a brand that actually sticks. These aren’t your typical real estate sites that make agents fight for attention. Each one is purpose-built to support the agent experience from lead gen to closing (and all the chaos in between).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether you&#8217;re working with luxury buyers, savvy investors, or first-timers looking for homes on the MLS, eXp gives you a polished, tech-forward ecosystem that makes you look good and work even better. Here’s how agents benefit:</p>\n<h3 id=\"attract-more-clients\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Attract More Clients</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp websites open doors, literally and figuratively, by helping you connect with buyers and sellers through dynamic, customizable platforms. Instead of competing with third-party listing sites, you can send clients directly to your own IDX-powered website or use national and luxury portals to highlight your listings where the right eyes will find them.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You also get access to exclusive real estate listings that other agents simply can’t offer. From off-market opportunities on eXp Exclusives to pre-market homes inside Zenlist, you’ll be able to give your clients that “first look” advantage that builds loyalty (and wins deals).</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/97a6b8d2d8b2f1b2-Attract-More-Clients.webp/public\" alt=\"Attract More Clients\" class=\"wp-image-267551 size-full\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Attract-More-Clients.webp 499w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Attract-More-Clients-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With features like property search alerts, branded home pages, lead capture tools, and client collaboration portals, these sites don’t just sit there; they work for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"streamline-collaboration\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Streamline Collaboration</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Time is money, and wasting it with disconnected tools is so 2008. eXp’s platform is fully integrated with agent tools that keep your transactions, your clients, and your team running smoothly.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents can communicate with clients directly through their IDX site or Zenlist, push out curated property lists, and collaborate in real-time, even while on a showing. And when things get complex, you’re backed by a <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/employees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">24/7 support system</a> and a <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/exp-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cloud-based office</a> where you can meet with staff, brokers, or other agents face-to-face (without ever putting on real pants).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Client-facing communication feels modern, responsive, and personal, which is exactly what today’s buyers and sellers expect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"boost-your-brand\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Boost Your Brand</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a sea of templated agent bios and cookie-cutter websites, eXp agents stand out. Whether you&#8217;re showcasing homes on the national site, highlighting high-end listings on eXp Luxury, or customizing your personal IDX website for realtors, everything you present is professional, polished, and unmistakably yours.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/bf30cac04cf8588d-eXp-homes-for-sale-Boost-Your-Brand.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp homes for sale, Boost Your Brand\" class=\"wp-image-267553 size-full\" width=\"499\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eXp-homes-for-sale-Boost-Your-Brand.webp 499w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eXp-homes-for-sale-Boost-Your-Brand-480x275.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Your name stays front and center. Your leads stay yours. And your brand builds every time someone interacts with your site, your listings, or your marketing materials. Combine that with <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/locations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global exposure</a>, relocation partnerships, and a network of thousands of like-minded professionals, and you’ve got a platform built for growth.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"more-benefits-that-actually-matter\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">More Benefits That Actually Matter</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Free IDX websites mean you don’t have to pay third-party vendors for the basics.</li>\n<li>Integrated lead capture keeps your contacts flowing into <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/boldtrail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your free CRM</a>.</li>\n<li>Exclusive listing access helps agents stand out in a tight-inventory market.</li>\n<li>International exposure gives your listings visibility far beyond your zip code.</li>\n<li>Built-in marketing tools help you promote with zero design skills required.</li>\n<li>No tech fees for core platforms (unlike many brokerages that nickel and dime).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp, the tech actually works and it works for you. No bloated platforms, no outdated portals, and definitely no waiting for your broker to “fix it for you.” You’re in control, and your clients feel the difference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-also-ask-about-e-xp-homes-for-sale\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About eXp Homes for Sale</h2>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-homes-for-sale-just-one-website\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is eXp Homes for Sale just one website?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. eXp Homes for Sale refers to a group of listing platforms that include the national MLS site, eXp Luxury, agent IDX websites, and private eXp Exclusive listings. Each platform serves a different purpose and audience within the overall technology ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-this-differ-from-zillow-or-redfin\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does this differ from Zillow or Redfin?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zillow and Redfin are third-party portals that monetize agent traffic. eXp Realty websites are designed to support agents directly, preserve branding, and integrate with internal tools like IDX websites and Zenlist without reselling leads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-benefits-most-from-e-xps-listing-ecosystem\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who benefits most from eXp’s listing ecosystem?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents working with buyers, sellers, luxury clients, or investors benefit most. The system supports multiple business models, including high-volume producers, niche specialists, and agents operating in low-inventory markets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-e-xp-realty-websites-and-smart-agent-alliance-help-you-scale-faster\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty technology is designed to address agent use cases like listings, lead capture, and collaboration, but it does not operate in isolation or replace the broader brokerage experience.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b182ea753238642b-Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp/public\" alt=\"Team SAA - Smart Agent Alliance\" class=\"wp-image-267426 size-full\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp 499w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752715181752\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Do all eXp Realty agents get a free IDX website?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes.

This isn’t just some rebranded franchise with a new logo—it’s a full-blown evolution of the industry. By putting agents at the center of every decision, eXp has flipped the traditional brokerage pyramid upside down. The result? A business model that runs on agent empowerment, profitability, and relentless modernization.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6f451af805fa1028-Agent-Resources-Why-eXp-Realty-Stays-Ahead-of-the-Pack.webp/public\" alt=\"Agent Resources, Why eXp Realty Stays Ahead of the Pack\" class=\"wp-image-267479\" width=\"1000\" height=\"231\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Agent-Resources-Why-eXp-Realty-Stays-Ahead-of-the-Pack.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Agent-Resources-Why-eXp-Realty-Stays-Ahead-of-the-Pack-980x226.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Agent-Resources-Why-eXp-Realty-Stays-Ahead-of-the-Pack-480x111.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This agent-centric design gives eXp agents access to a steady stream of real estate agent resources, tools, and support that keep up with the pace of the industry. Where most brokerages play catch-up, eXp is leading the charge. From automated marketing to productivity dashboards and virtual real estate workspaces, the company’s cloud-based infrastructure means agents can scale smarter and faster, without the baggage of outdated tech or expensive office overhead.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s talk about the innovation real estate agents can feel. eXp Realty doesn’t just slap “tech-forward” on a flyer—it shows up with the goods. Whether it’s interactive listing tools, real-time CRM integrations, or AI-powered lead systems, every piece of technology for real estate is designed to help agents grow their business, not just survive market shifts. No more juggling platforms that don’t talk to each other. No more hours wasted on manual follow-up. Just smooth, integrated systems that make it easier to do your job and look good doing it.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And guess what? That kind of innovation directly boosts client service, too. When you’ve got tools like virtual walkthroughs, branded buyer/seller kits, and live communication links at your fingertips, your buyers and sellers feel it. They trust it. That confidence leads to faster deals, better referrals, and more long-term wins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"constantly-evolving-e-xps-new-resources-and-innovations\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Constantly Evolving: eXp’s New Resources and Innovations</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most brokerages stick with the same old tools year after year. eXp Realty? It rolls out <em>new resources</em> consistently, keeping agents ahead of the curve. Sure, there are updates throughout the year, but it’s at <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EXPCON</a>—eXp’s largest annual in-person event—where you can expect a game-changing lineup of announcements. These aren’t just surface-level tweaks. We&#8217;re talking <em>real estate agent resources</em> that directly enhance productivity, boost marketing efforts, and drive profitability, all tailored to help <em>eXp agents</em> work smarter and grow faster.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cff995cc7f087532-Constantly-Evolving-eXps-New-Resources-and-Innovations.webp/public\" alt=\"Constantly Evolving eXp’s New Resources and Innovations\" class=\"wp-image-267478\" width=\"1000\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Constantly-Evolving-eXps-New-Resources-and-Innovations.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Constantly-Evolving-eXps-New-Resources-and-Innovations-980x196.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Constantly-Evolving-eXps-New-Resources-and-Innovations-480x96.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/expcon-2024-general-session/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2024, <em>eXp Realty</em></a> came out swinging. At EXPCON Miami, they revealed the acquisition of luxury marketing platform LUXVT, added full agent access to <em>Canva Pro</em> (Enterprise level, loaded with pre-built <em>eXp templates</em>), rolled out a sleek new public website, and announced a powerful partnership with <em>Sisu</em>—a business intelligence platform that helps agents track performance and streamline operations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">2023 was just as stacked. That year, <a href=\"https://expworldholdings.com/press-releases/exp-realty-unlocks-nationwide-listing-network-with-the-power-of-exp-exclusives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp launched <em>eXp Exclusives</em></a>, giving agents and their clients first dibs on pre-market and off-market listings. The <em>Listing Presentation Kit</em> and <em>Active Listing Kit</em> debuted as customizable, high-impact marketing tools. <em>eXp World</em> moved from a clunky download to a browser-based experience, and agents gained access to <em>My Link My Lead</em>, a tool that turns content into clickable lead funnels.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other recent innovations include the launch of <a href=\"https://expworldholdings.com/press-releases/the-future-of-luxury-real-estate-has-arrived-at-exp-realty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>eXp Luxury</em></a>, <a href=\"https://expworldholdings.com/press-releases/success-announces-enhanced-coaching-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SUCCESS® Coaching</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/lender\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SUCCESS® Lending</em></a>, plus the expansion of the <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/revenos-leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Revenos referral network</em></a> and the debut of <em>SUCCESS Health</em>. These aren’t just shiny extras—they’re built-in tools tied directly to <em>eXp Realty agent</em> success, showing exactly why the <em>eXp business model</em> is in a league of its own.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-e-xp-realty-keep-raising-the-bar\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Does eXp Realty Keep Raising the Bar?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s talk money—specifically, eXp profits, and how they’re put to work. Unlike many brokerages still patching holes in a sinking ship<a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/profits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">, eXp Realty is not just surviving—it’s profitable</a>. Very profitable! And instead of hoarding those profits, eXp reinvests them directly into agent resources that move the needle. We’re talking upgraded technology for real estate, cutting-edge marketing tools, and advanced training platforms that help eXp agents work smarter, not harder.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/bab8114f046c5633-Your-Career-Advantage.webp/public\" alt=\"Rocket flying ahead of paper airplanes, symbolizing career advantage and the importance of asking brokerage interview questions.\" class=\"wp-image-243261 size-full\" width=\"1000\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage-980x300.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage-480x147.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That sustainable, reinvest-and-grow model isn’t just smart—it’s empowering. It creates long-term growth, better eXp agent support, and a system that evolves with the market instead of reacting to it ten steps too late. This is what agent-focused innovation looks like in practice, and it’s one of the biggest eXp Realty benefits there is.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, how can eXp afford to outpace every other brokerage when it comes to real estate agent resources? Easy: it’s the only publicly traded real estate brokerage that’s been profitable for the past five years. Yep, the only one! That’s a big deal because when brokerages bleed money, guess who ends up covering the costs? You. Are those surprise “admin fees,” downgraded tools, or mysterious commission split changes? That’s not bad luck—it’s a business model in crisis.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unprofitable brokerages cut corners, easy to see when you read anonymous <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agent reviews</a>. Those brokerages stall on tech upgrades. They lay off support teams. They rebrand, restructure, or vanish altogether. And somewhere in the middle of a transaction, you’re the one left explaining it to a confused client. That’s not just annoying—it’s a hit to your credibility and your paycheck.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most successful real estate companies don’t just weather tough markets—they prepare for them. They manage expenses, leverage smart systems, and protect their agents’ bottom line. So if you’ve ever Googled “is eXp Realty profitable?” or “How to value a real estate brokerage”, here’s your answer: the value of eXp lies in its sustainability because broke brokerages break agents. eXp is built to keep you winning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-e-xp-business-model-in-a-nutshell\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The eXp Business Model in a Nutshell</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The eXp Realty business model is simple: cut the overhead and boost the value. As a fully virtual real estate brokerage, eXp eliminates the cost of brick-and-mortar offices and reinvests in technology for real estate, training, and agent support. With tools like eXp World, BoldTrail, Sisu, and full Canva Pro access, agents get everything they need to grow, without paying extra for office furniture they’ll never use.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More than 85,000 agents worldwide are thriving in this cloud-based, agent-first model—because when you remove the fluff and focus on what helps agents succeed, everybody wins.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-also-ask-about-e-xp-realty-innovation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About eXp Realty Innovation</h2>\n<h3 id=\"are-e-xp-realty-agent-resources-included-or-do-agents-pay-extra-for-them\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are eXp Realty agent resources included, or do agents pay extra for them?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Core agent resources are included as part of the brokerage platform. These tools are funded through the company’s operating model rather than sold individually. Agents may still choose optional third-party services, but the primary innovation stack is built into eXp Realty support.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-often-does-e-xp-realty-release-new-tools-or-updates\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How often does eXp Realty release new tools or updates?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Updates occur throughout the year, with larger announcements typically made at EXPCON. Smaller enhancements and refinements are released on an ongoing basis, allowing agent systems to improve continuously rather than through infrequent major overhauls.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-e-xp-realty-innovation-compare-to-traditional-brokerages\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does eXp Realty innovation compare to traditional brokerages?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional brokerages often rely on local offices to choose tools and fund upgrades. eXp Realty centralizes innovation, allowing it to deploy consistent resources across markets without relying on franchise-level decisions or physical infrastructure investments.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-e-xp-realty-keeps-agents-ahead\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Support through eXp Realty agent resources is designed to help agents access tools and internal infrastructure, but it does not operate independently or replace the broader eXp Realty platform.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life.

Just head to the Apple App Store or Google Play Store and search &#8220;My eXp&#8221;. Tap “Install” or “Get,” depending on your device, and boom, you’ve officially upgraded your mobile game. Open the app after installation to make sure everything’s working as it should. And don’t skip those updates, they’re what keep your My eXp dashboard fresh and glitch-free.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"why-you-should-poke-around-in-the-app\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why You Should Poke Around in the App</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The My eXp mobile app is built <em>exclusively</em> for phones, which means it’s fast, sleek, and doesn’t make you pinch-zoom to find what you need. Many agents describe the app as reducing friction by centralizing access to tools they already use.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, take a few minutes to explore. Peek into your revenue share stats, browse training options or check how much eXp stock you’ve got tucked away. The more you use it, the more useful it becomes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-secret-weapon-the-menu\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Secret Weapon: The Menu</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Want to be the agent who knows where everything lives? Spend time on the menu. From the eXp World guide and Morgan Stanley access to the <a href=\"https://www.expbrandstore.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brand Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.utilityconnect.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Utility Connect</a>, Workplace, and the ever-handy Help Center, this page is loaded with shortcuts to everything you’ll need, especially when you’re running your business between showings, closings, and texts from clients asking what escrow is (again).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bottom line? The My eXp app is your mobile control center for all things eXp and knowing how to navigate it means less time digging and more time doing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-also-ask-about-the-my-e-xp-app\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About the My eXp App</h2>\n<h3 id=\"is-the-my-e-xp-app-required-for-e-xp-realty-agents-to-use\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is the My eXp app required for eXp Realty agents to use?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. The My eXp app is optional, not mandatory. Agents can access many of the same tools through desktop portals, but the app consolidates them into a mobile-first experience. Most agents choose to use it because it simplifies access to metrics, training, and support while on the go.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-my-e-xp-compare-to-using-multiple-separate-e-xp-tools\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does My eXp compare to using multiple separate eXp tools?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">My eXp does not replace every standalone tool, but it centralizes access to them. Instead of remembering multiple URLs and logins, agents use one dashboard that links out to training, support, stock, revenue share, and collaboration tools, reducing friction and saving time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-benefits-most-from-using-the-my-e-xp-app\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who benefits most from using the My eXp app?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents who work remotely, travel frequently, or manage their business between appointments benefit most. New agents use it to learn where resources live, while experienced agents rely on it for quick access to metrics, support, and internal updates without sitting at a desk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-the-my-e-xp-app-and-the-right-team-make-all-the-difference\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty technology is designed to support agents without requiring physical offices, but it does not operate in isolation or replace the broader brokerage experience.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-980x194.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-480x95.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1768882333567\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>What is the My eXp app used for?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>The My eXp app is a mobile dashboard built for eXp Realty agents to access production metrics, revenue share, stock information, training, and internal resources.

Let’s break down the two types of teams you’ll hear about at eXp.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sponsor-teams-bonus-support-if-you-pick-the-right-one\">Sponsor Teams: Bonus Support (If You Pick the Right One)</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Sponsor teams—like Smart Agent Alliance—are made up of agents who offer tools, mentorship, community, and training to their downline. When you name a Smart Agent Alliance founder as your eXp sponsor, you’re plugging into proven systems that would normally cost thousands (and sometimes still underdeliver). The value? All included—no extra charge.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b182ea753238642b-Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp/public\" alt=\"Team SAA - Smart Agent Alliance\" class=\"wp-image-267426 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>But here’s the catch: <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/basics\">most eXp sponsors aren’t part of a structured sponsor team</a>. And they’re not required to offer you anything beyond their name for your join eXp application. So when you hear “meet our team” or see someone pushing an eXp sponsor team, make sure they’re actually offering value and not just a Canva logo and vibes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"organized-teams-where-structure-meets-splits\">Organized Teams: Where Structure Meets Splits</h3>\n<p>This blog? It’s about the other kind—organized real estate teams at eXp. These are formal business setups with a team leader, one or more real estate teammates, and a signed agreement that lays out how the whole thing runs. Think of it like a mini brokerage within the brokerage.</p>\n<p>You get defined commission splits, assigned roles, and a system built to make the business more scalable, without the overhead of a traditional office. eXp stays hands-off when it comes to internal team drama, so make sure your contracts are airtight and your expectations are crystal clear.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-you-join-a-sponsor-team-and-an-organized-team-at-e-xp\">Can You Join a Sponsor Team <em>and</em> an Organized Team at eXp?</h3>\n<p>And yes, you can absolutely be part of a sponsor team and also join an organized team. They serve two totally different purposes, and finding both <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/find-yours\">your ideal sponsor</a> and a great organized team can give you the best of both worlds: support, mentorship, structure, and scalability.</p>\n<p>Now that we’ve sorted that out, let’s talk about what real estate teams actually are—and how they work.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-a-real-estate-team-really\">What Is a Real Estate Team, Really?</h2>\n<p>At its core, a real estate team is a group of agents and support staff working under a structured system to move deals faster and serve clients better. These teams are like well-oiled machines—everyone’s got a job, and no one’s stuck doing five roles badly.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"287\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a542e019a8f02acf-Can-You-Join-a-Sponsor-Team-and-an-Organized-Team-at-eXp.webp/public\" alt=\"Can You Join a Sponsor Team and an Organized Team at eXp\" class=\"wp-image-267431 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Can-You-Join-a-Sponsor-Team-and-an-Organized-Team-at-eXp.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Can-You-Join-a-Sponsor-Team-and-an-Organized-Team-at-eXp-300x172.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>You’ll often find buyer specialists who focus solely on guiding clients through the purchase process while listing agents handle pricing strategy, sometimes using tools like <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/curbio\">Curbio</a> to get properties market-ready without upfront costs.  Transaction coordinators keep the paperwork flowing with help from <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/skyslope\">Skyslope</a>e, and admin pros handle everything from scheduling to CRM upkeep. This specialization helps every team member operate in their zone of genius, and helps clients feel like they’re getting VIP treatment at every stage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>But not every real estate agent team runs like a corporate org chart. Some real estate teams operate more casually: they generate leads together, share marketing resources, and cheer each other on, while each agent still runs their own deals from start to finish.</p>\n<p>No matter the style, the goal’s the same: streamline the chaos, deliver top-notch service, and grow faster than you could solo.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exploring-e-xp-realty-team-structures-which-one-fits-your-business\">Exploring eXp Realty Team Structures: Which One Fits Your Business?</h2>\n<p>So, you&#8217;ve got your eye on the eXp Realty team model—but which version? Just like real estate clients, not all teams come with the same needs, paperwork, or personalities. Luckily, eXp Realty gives you options.</p>\n<p>There are four main eXp team structures, and each comes with its own rules around production requirements, commission splits, and team size. Whether you&#8217;re rolling solo with your spouse or scaling to empire status, eXp has a setup for you.</p>\n<p>Let’s break it down—without the boring parts.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-domestic-teams-just-the-two-of-you-and-one-cap\">1. Domestic Teams: Just the Two of You (and One Cap)</h3>\n<p>Domestic Teams are exactly what they sound like—a two-agent power couple setup. You and your spouse (or domestic partner) team up, share one $16K cap, and work your market like the duo you are. All you need is proof you file taxes together or a marriage certificate.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This real estate team structure is ideal for agents who share more than just a CRM. You’re working together day in and day out, making joint decisions, splitting the load, and probably negotiating who’s doing dinner between showings. Efficiency and flexibility with built-in support—plus, no need for complex team paperwork.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/4a721233dfafdca3-Domestic-Teams-Just-the-Two-of-You-and-One-Cap.webp/public\" alt=\"Domestic Teams Just the Two of You and One Cap\" class=\"wp-image-267432 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Domestic-Teams-Just-the-Two-of-You-and-One-Cap.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Domestic-Teams-Just-the-Two-of-You-and-One-Cap-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-self-organized-teams-casual-vibes-solid-collaboration\">2. Self-Organized Teams: Casual Vibes, Solid Collaboration</h3>\n<p>A Self-Organized Team at eXp is basically the “we’re all friends who hustle together” model. There are no official cap reduction or team lead requirements here—just agents working together in a loosely defined structure. You can share leads, systems, and memes. You’re independent but cooperative.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>There’s also no limit to how big your self-organized team can get, and as long as there’s no formal team agreement, you can even have multiple side teams or informal alliances. This structure is perfect for entrepreneurial agents who want teamwork without a hierarchy.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/473c5133a11addbb-Self-Organized-Teams-Casual-Vibes-Solid-Collaboration.webp/public\" alt=\"Self-Organized Teams Casual Vibes, Solid Collaboration\" class=\"wp-image-267434 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Self-Organized-Teams-Casual-Vibes-Solid-Collaboration.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Self-Organized-Teams-Casual-Vibes-Solid-Collaboration-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-standard-teams-the-startup-squad-with-structure\">3. Standard Teams: The Startup Squad with Structure</h3>\n<p>Want reduced caps for your real estate teammates and a bit more structure? Time to talk Standard Teams.</p>\n<p>To qualify, your team leader must have closed 30 transactions or $6 million in volume over the last 12 months. Team members can choose a reduced $8K cap, but that comes with a catch: the team lead must receive at least 25% of each transaction.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This setup creates clear roles, workflows, and revenue-sharing that help newer agents get mentorship while more experienced ones scale faster. It’s a smart option for those looking to run a lean, productive, and profitable eXp Realty team—without needing $40M in production (yet) and while still keeping more commission than with so-called <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/100-percent\">100% commission brokerages.</a></p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"501\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/bc4a0bb41c90a9cc-Standard-Teams-The-Startup-Squad-with-Structure.webp/public\" alt=\"Standard Teams The Startup Squad with Structure\" class=\"wp-image-267428 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Standard-Teams-The-Startup-Squad-with-Structure.webp 501w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Standard-Teams-The-Startup-Squad-with-Structure-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-mega-icon-teams-for-the-agents-who-run-things\">4. Mega Icon Teams: For the Agents Who Run Things</h3>\n<p>Mega Icon Teams are the top-tier model at eXp. These teams are for leaders who’ve closed $40 million or 175 transactions in the last 12 months, and have at least 10 team members who would’ve capped individually. Some may tap into resources like <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/exp-commercial\">eXp Commercial</a> too.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The benefits? Huge. Team members can opt into a $4K cap (yes, really), but they’ll need to give the team lead that same minimum of 25% per transaction. There’s no cap on how large these teams can grow, and because they’re producing at volume, they often have access to more tools, higher-level training, and massive scalability potential.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/aad806abdd2ad6fe-Mega-Icon-Teams-For-the-Agents-Who-Run-Things.webp/public\" alt=\"Mega Icon Teams For the Agents Who Run Things\" class=\"wp-image-267433 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mega-Icon-Teams-For-the-Agents-Who-Run-Things.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mega-Icon-Teams-For-the-Agents-Who-Run-Things-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Think of Mega Icon Teams as the top eXp Realty teams—elite squads designed for domination, expansion, and long-term growth through revenue share.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-quick-comparison-of-e-xp-realty-team-types\">A Quick Comparison of eXp Realty Team Types</h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Team Type</td>\n<td>Cap Options</td>\n<td>Min Requirements</td>\n<td>Team Size</td>\n<td>Team Lead Cut (if cap reduced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Domestic</td>\n<td>Shared $16K cap</td>\n<td>Must be spouses or partners</td>\n<td>2 max</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Self-Organized</td>\n<td>$16K per agent</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Unlimited</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard</td>\n<td>$8K optional cap</td>\n<td>$6M or 30 deals/year</td>\n<td>Min 2, no max</td>\n<td>25% minimum per deal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mega Icon</td>\n<td>$4K optional cap</td>\n<td>$40M or 175 deals/year</td>\n<td>Min 11+, no max</td>\n<td>25% minimum per deal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-e-xp-realty-commission-splits-work-on-a-team\">How Do eXp Realty Commission Splits Work on a Team?</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about everyone’s favorite topic: getting paid. Specifically, how much of it you actually <em>keep</em> when you’re on an eXp Realty team—because if you think your team leader takes a cut <em>and</em> that’s the end of it… Surprise! eXp wants their piece too.</p>\n<p>Here’s the deal: being part of an organized real estate team often means you’re splitting commission <em>twice</em>—once with your team leader, and then again with eXp. It&#8217;s not a scam—it’s just how commission splits for teams are structured. Knowing how the dollars flow can save you from some serious math shock on payday.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-commissions-are-calculated-on-e-xp-teams\">How Commissions Are Calculated on eXp Teams</h3>\n<p><strong>Here’s the general order of operations:</strong></p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Any outside referrals owed to other brokers come off the top.</li>\n<li>The remaining gross commission is split between the team leader and team member based on your agreement (commonly 50/50).</li>\n<li>Then, eXp’s company dollar (the 20% split up to your cap) and transaction fees are deducted from <em>each agent’s share</em> individually.</li>\n<li>Fees like the broker review fee, capped transaction fee, and risk management fee are per transaction—not per agent—so they’re usually split 50/50.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-example-10-000-gross-commission-deal\">Real Example: $10,000 Gross Commission Deal</h3>\n<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>50/50 split between the team leader and the team member</li>\n<li>Team leader is capped</li>\n<li>Team member is not capped</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s say your team just closed a deal for $10,000. High five.<br />Now the fun begins&#8230;</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>$5,000 goes to the Team Leader</li>\n<li>$5,000 goes to the Team Member</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Easy, right? Not so fast.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"team-leaders-cut-capped\">Team Leader’s Cut (Capped):</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start with $5,000</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of capped transaction fee ($250) ? $5,000 &#8211; $125 = $4,875</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of broker review fee ($25) ? $4,875 &#8211; $12.50 = $4,862.50</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of risk management fee ($60) ? $4,862.50 &#8211; $30 = $4,832.50 net</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"team-members-cut-uncapped\">Team Member’s Cut (Uncapped):</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start with $5,000</li>\n<li>Subtract 20% to eXp ($1,000) ? $4,000</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of broker review fee ($12.50) ? $3,987.50</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of the risk management fee ($30) ? $3,957.50 net</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wait-so-im-paying-both\">Wait—So I&#8217;m Paying <em>Both</em>?</h3>\n<p>Yep. When you&#8217;re on an eXp Realty team, your team leader gets their agreed-upon cut (at least 25% if you&#8217;re on a reduced cap like in Standard or Mega Icon Teams), <em>and</em> eXp still collects their usual 20% company dollar and transaction fees from you directly.</p>\n<p>So even if you’re handing 25% of your commission to your team lead, you’re still on the hook for your personal split with eXp.</p>\n<p>And all those little fees? Broker review, risk management, capped transaction fees—they get split between you and the team leader per transaction, not per team. So don’t be surprised when you both see those line items pop up on your statement. Welcome to the wild world of real estate team structures. It’s not complicated once you see how it flows, but it <em>is</em> important to understand before your first payday surprise.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-team-members-icon-at-e-xp-realty\">Can Team Members ICON at eXp Realty?</h2>\n<p>Ah, the ICON Agent <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eXp-Realty-US-ICON-Program-Overview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ICON Agent Award</a>—a shiny badge of honor and a nice chunk of your cap back in stock. But if you’re part of an eXp Realty team, especially an organized one, you’re probably wondering: <em>Do team members still qualify for ICON?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes, but it depends on your cap.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"204\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6cd74ed4f9f7ec53-eXp-Realty-Stock-Awards-and-ICON-Status-ICON-status-photo.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty Stock Awards and ICON Status ICON status photo\" class=\"wp-image-249966\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eXp-Realty-Stock-Awards-and-ICON-Status-ICON-status-photo.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eXp-Realty-Stock-Awards-and-ICON-Status-ICON-status-photo-300x61.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eXp-Realty-Stock-Awards-and-ICON-Status-ICON-status-photo-768x157.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Here’s how it works across the different eXp team structures:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Domestic Teams: Only one ICON award is available per team since you&#8217;re sharing one $16K cap. So if you&#8217;re in a two-person Domestic Team, you’ll have to fight it out (or, you know, just agree on it like adults).</li>\n<li>Self-Organized Teams: Every agent is on a full $16K cap here, which means every team member can qualify for ICON independently. No restrictions. Just hustle close deals, and get rewarded.</li>\n<li>Standard Teams: Team members can still ICON—but only if they opt to stay on the full $16K cap instead of taking the reduced $8K cap option. If they go with the lower cap, they won’t be eligible. So it’s basically a choice: save money upfront or play the long game for ICON benefits.</li>\n<li>Mega Icon Teams: Same rules as Standard Teams, just scaled up. Members can ICON if they stay on the full $16K cap. If they choose the reduced $4K cap, ICON’s off the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So yes, eXp Realty team members can achieve <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/icon-agent\">ICON status</a>—but only if they’re willing to commit to the full cap. If you’re running the numbers, just know that ICON status comes with some serious perks, including up to $16,000 in stock incentives. Worth considering if you’re aiming high.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-you-add-team-members-in-another-state\">Can You Add Team Members in Another State?</h2>\n<p>So your eXp Realty team is up and running, and now you’re thinking bigger—like <em>multi-state bigger</em>. Maybe you’ve got a rockstar agent in Texas, but your team’s based in California. Can they join your team?</p>\n<p>Yes, team members in another state <em>can</em> be added to your organized eXp Realty team—but don’t skip over the fine print.</p>\n<p>Here’s the deal: crossing state lines means crossing into a jungle of licensing laws, broker supervision rules, and set-up logistics. Every state has its real estate regulatory circus, and eXp needs to make sure your team is compliant no matter where it operates.</p>\n<p>Before adding that out-of-state agent, you’ll need to loop in teamservices@exprealty.net or hop into the Onboarding &#038; Agent Support Lobby. They’ll walk you through how to handle the different state requirements, paperwork, and onboarding steps.</p>\n<p><strong>One exception?</strong> Domestic Teams. If you’re in a Domestic Team and want to add another state, both partners must be licensed in that same state. Otherwise, it won’t fly—and commissions can’t be processed without referrals.</p>\n<p>So yes, you can build a cross-state real estate team at eXp. Just make sure you’re not winging it, because “winging it” doesn’t go over well with state real estate commissions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-e-xp-realty-collaboration-and-smart-agent-alliance-can-help-you-grow\">How eXp Realty Collaboration and Smart Agent Alliance Can Help You Grow</h2>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re thinking about starting a team, joining one, or just trying to understand how eXp Realty team structures work without falling into a black hole of confusion, this guide should have cleared things up.</p>\n<p>What makes eXp stand out is how it empowers agents to collaborate, scale, and build smart real estate businesses.

Reduced-cap team members (like those on Standard or Mega Icon Teams) are not eligible for ICON status. Domestic teams can share the cap but only one can earn ICON.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What is the difference between a sponsor team and an organized team at eXp?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Sponsor teams offer optional coaching, tools, and community support to agents in their downline. Organized teams are formal business entities with commission splits, agreements, and roles under eXp’s official team structure.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Can I be in both a sponsor team and an organized team?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Yes. Sponsor teams and organized teams serve different purposes. You can be in both at the same time and benefit from the support and structure each offers.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">How are commissions split on eXp Realty teams?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">The commission is first split between the team leader and team member (often 25 – 50% going to the team leader). Then, eXp deducts its 20% company split (unless the agent has capped) and applicable transaction fees from each agent’s share individually.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Are transaction fees split or charged per person?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Fees like the broker review and risk management fee are charged per transaction, not per agent. That means they are typically split between team members.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Can eXp Realty teams include agents from different states?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Yes, but compliance rules vary by state. You’ll need to coordinate with eXp&#8217;s Team Services to ensure all legal requirements are met. Domestic team members must both be licensed in the same state.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

    "content": "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong>Making It Rain at eXp Realty is a brokerage-operated PPC advertising program that runs Google and Meta ads on behalf of agents and delivers buyer and seller leads directly into the agent’s CRM. It matters most to agents who want paid online leads without personally managing ad platforms, vendors, or campaign setup.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tl-dr-about-making-it-rain-e-xp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR About Making It Rain eXp Realty</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Making It Rain is eXp Realty’s internal PPC advertising program</li>\n<li>Campaigns are managed by eXp’s in-house marketing team</li>\n<li>Ads run on Google and Meta platforms under the agent’s branding</li>\n<li>Leads are delivered directly into the agent’s connected CRM</li>\n<li>No referral fee is charged at closing for these leads</li>\n<li>Participation is optional and billed monthly</li>\n<li>The program sits inside eXp’s broader Revenos lead ecosystem</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many agents want online buyer and seller leads but do not want to become part-time digital advertisers. Managing Google PPC, Meta ads, targeting rules, compliance, landing pages, and tracking requires time, testing, and ongoing adjustment. Most agents either outsource this work to third-party vendors or stop altogether after inconsistent results.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Making It Rain exists to remove that operational burden by centralizing paid advertising inside the brokerage.This article explains how Making It Rain at eXp Realty fits into the broader <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty leads ecosystem</a> available to eXp agents.

They want a real system. Making It Rain eXp Realty is that system inside eXp. It was created by Glenn Sanford when the company started and now sits inside eXp <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/revenos-leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Revenos</a>, eXp’s full-time lead generation division. In simple terms, Making It Rain eXp Realty is the in house real estate PPC leads program that sits under eXp Revenos and powers Google PPC real estate leads and Facebook ads for real estate agents, all tied directly into eXp’s CRM choices.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You begin by picking your campaign type, budget, and target area. Inside the Making It Rain dashboard you choose Home Search Leads, Express Offers leads, or FlexReach, then set your ad spend. eXp’s internal team handles the tech, targeting, and tracking.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mary H. talks about eXp’s model as “built for agents,” because the training, collaboration, and systems all work together. She says a big part of her consistency comes from leaning into eXp’s offerings instead of trying to build everything alone. The relationships and tools gave her a more steady, predictable business base.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In plain English, Making It Rain is like hiring a full-time ad team and paying them a gym membership fee instead of a full salary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"which-brokerages-offer-lead-generation-and-why-making-it-rain-stands-out\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Which Brokerages Offer Lead Generation And Why Making It Rain Stands Out</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many brokerages say they “provide leads,” but most rely on third party portals, team leaders, or office floor time. eXp Realty is different. It built a full-time internal lead division, Revenos, and programs like Making It Rain and Zoocasa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents search things like “Best brokerages for agents looking to get buyer and seller leads” or “Brokerages offering paid lead packages for real estate agents” because they feel stuck between expensive portals and broker promises. Traditional firms often depend on Zillow, Realtor.com, or office leads that appear and disappear with the market.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp, Revenos and Making It Rain are built into the model. Instead of waiting for your broker to hand you a lead, you log in, choose your campaign, and let eXp’s marketing team run the ads under your name and branding. You are not fighting over a shared pool. You are launching your own pipeline.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This also answers a quiet question: “How do brokerages provide leads to their affiliated agents?” In many places, it is through random rotation or whoever is in the office. With Making It Rain, the agent who orders the campaign gets the leads. No games, no silent priority list.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Artemisa B. came to the U.S. from Mexico and started from zero in a new market. Over time, by leaning into the systems and support at eXp, she closed 223 deals as a solo agent. She credits the company’s tools and leverage for letting her grow far beyond what her old brokerage model allowed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the average “lead program” is a leaky bucket, Making It Rain is closer to a faucet you can actually turn on and off without breaking the handle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"express-offers-leads\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making It Rain Lead Types: Home Search, Express Offers, FlexReach</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Making It Rain offers three main campaign types. Home Search Leads capture buyers searching Google for homes in your area. Express Offers Leads attract motivated sellers who want cash or quick options. FlexReach is a flexible product that promotes events, retargets your database, or reaches custom audiences using uploaded lists or geotargeting.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9883361de063e5d2-Express-Offers-Leads.webp/public\" alt=\"Express Offers Leads\" class=\"wp-image-267412\" width=\"1000\" height=\"178\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Express-Offers-Leads.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Express-Offers-Leads-980x174.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Express-Offers-Leads-480x85.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When agents ask “Brokerages that supply exclusive leads to their agents?” what they really mean is “Can I choose the type of business I want?” Making It Rain is structured around that idea. Each campaign type serves a clear purpose and uses channels that match how buyers and sellers actually behave online.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Home Search Leads<br />These campaigns focus on buyers searching phrases like “homes for sale in Austin” or “three bedroom house in Novato.” eXp’s team runs Google PPC ads that send people to your IDX home search site. They register to see more listings. The lead lands in your CRM with search behavior attached for smarter follow up.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Express Offers Leads<br />Express Offers leads are seller focused. These campaigns speak to owners who are open to cash offers, convenience, or speed. The ads often run on Facebook and drive people to a simple form. These are highly motivated sellers, but they still need options, education, and a skilled agent to help them choose the best path.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FlexReach<br />FlexReach is the flexible tool. You can upload a list of past clients, event registrants, or cold leads, or you can geotarget a neighborhood. eXp runs ads across channels like Google and Meta, and in some campaigns even Amazon, to stay in front of that specific audience. It is perfect for events, open houses, webinars, or “Is now a good time to sell?” reminders.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Together, Home Search Leads, Express Offers leads, and FlexReach form the core of the Making It Rain leads system at eXp Realty, giving agents a clear mix of buyer, seller, and custom campaign options inside one program.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agent Joel B. used FlexReach to promote an “Agents Helping Agents” event in Buffalo. He uploaded a list of local agents and let the system target them across multiple platforms. The people he wanted to reach saw the event everywhere. Ticket sales jumped, and the audience showed up already warmed up by the marketing.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FlexReach is basically the Swiss Army knife of Making It Rain, only you will actually use this tool more than once.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-using-e-xps-making-it-rain-program\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Making It Rain Connects To Your CRM And Tech For Auto Leads</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Making It Rain leads do not sit in your email. They are pushed straight into your CRM, such as Lofty, or BoldTrail. The MIR dashboard shows clicks, leads, and performance. You adjust locations, budgets, and campaign types in one place, then let your automations handle speed to lead and follow up.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents who search “Brokerages with technology platforms that generate leads automatically?” or “Brokerages that integrate CRM systems for lead management?” are looking for exactly this setup. At eXp, Making It Rain runs the ads. Your CRM receives the contacts. You build automation rules once, then let the system notify you like a digital assistant that never sleeps.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/68aef4f9d4e99b62-Benefits-of-Using-eXps-Making-It-Rain-Program.webp/public\" alt=\"Benefits of Using eXp&#039;s Making It Rain Program\" class=\"wp-image-267411 size-full\" width=\"497\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Benefits-of-Using-eXps-Making-It-Rain-Program.webp 497w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Benefits-of-Using-eXps-Making-It-Rain-Program-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 497px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once a Home Search or Express Offers lead registers, your CRM can send a text, email, and task in seconds. You can also tag FlexReach leads differently, such as past clients or “likely seller,” so the right scripts and follow up plans fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Inside the MIR dashboard, you see what is happening. You can filter by campaign, see cost per lead, and stop or change campaigns without opening three different ad platforms. For agents who are still juggling spreadsheets and sticky notes, this alone feels like air.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9b22970374cbec65-Benefits-of-Using-eXps-Making-It-Rain-Program-2.webp/public\" alt=\"Benefits of Using eXp&#039;s Making It Rain Program 2\" class=\"wp-image-267410 size-full\" width=\"498\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Benefits-of-Using-eXps-Making-It-Rain-Program-2.webp 498w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Benefits-of-Using-eXps-Making-It-Rain-Program-2-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 498px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ICON agent Raj J. explains that fifty to sixty percent of his business comes from a mix of sphere referrals and online leads through tools like Boldtrail landing pages. He says eXp’s systems helped him diversify, automate, and keep scaling even when others slowed down, because the tech kept feeding his pipeline.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If your current “CRM integration” is just copying phone numbers from your inbox, Making It Rain will feel like moving from a flip phone to a smart phone overnight.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"the-real-cost-of-making-it-rain-spoiler-its-not-just-your-ad-budget\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Does Making It Rain Cost?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Making It Rain is a paid monthly subscription that starts around $250 per month. You do not pay referral fees at closing. Membership is month to month, with flexible budgets. You close deals on your normal eXp split, then decide whether to scale, hold steady, or pause your campaigns.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many agents type “Brokerages with subscription services for lead access?” or “What are the commission structures for brokerages that provide agent leads?” because they have already felt the sting of a 50 or 60 percent split on “team leads.” Making It Rain flips that model. You pay for marketing, not for a permanent haircut on every check.Here is the simple math. If you spend $250 to $500 per month and close even one reasonable transaction every few months, the ROI usually beats most paid lead programs that take a large cut at closing. You still keep your standard eXp commission split. There is no extra company split just because the lead came from Making It Rain. Independent <a href=\"https://theclose.com/real-estate-lead-generation-statistics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate lead generation statistics for agents</a> show many agents spend a few hundred dollars per month on paid leads, often with less structure than Making It Rain.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/582336ee3694b93f-The-Real-Cost-of-Making-It-Rain-Spoiler-Its-Not-Just-Your-Ad-Budget.webp/public\" alt=\"The Real Cost of Making It Rain Spoiler It’s Not Just Your Ad Budget\" class=\"wp-image-267408\" width=\"1000\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Real-Cost-of-Making-It-Rain-Spoiler-Its-Not-Just-Your-Ad-Budget.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Real-Cost-of-Making-It-Rain-Spoiler-Its-Not-Just-Your-Ad-Budget-980x155.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Real-Cost-of-Making-It-Rain-Spoiler-Its-Not-Just-Your-Ad-Budget-480x76.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also scale up or down without asking permission. Have a busy season coming and want more buyer leads in a specific city or zip code. Increase the budget. Need to slow down during a life event or deep focus period. Pause or lower it. That flexibility is hard to find in traditional “lead packages.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agent Jill R. started with one accidental sale and treated real estate as a side project. After plugging into eXp’s systems, training, and lead tools, she went on to close 147 homes without holding listings. She credits the model and support for turning a small one off win into a full-time business.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Compared to handing over half your commission forever, a subscription you can turn off is the financial version of choosing a rental car instead of buying the whole dealership.</p>\n<h2 id=\"e-xp-agent-success-with-making-it-rain\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are Making It Rain Leads Any Good? Follow Up, Quality, And Results</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Making It Rain leads are as good as your follow up. Express Offers campaigns often attract very motivated sellers, while Home Search and FlexReach leads build a broad pipeline. The real edge comes from speed, empathy, and persistence. Most agents under call. The ones who win treat every lead as a conversation, not a quick sale.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When agents ask “How do brokerages vet and distribute leads to their agents?” they usually want to know if they are getting leftovers. With Making It Rain, you are not in a round robin. You receive leads from the campaigns you ordered. The key question becomes “What do you do in the first five minutes and the next thirty days?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">NAR data shows the average agent calls a lead about half the time it needs. Real contact often takes eight to twelve attempts across calls, texts, and emails. With Express Offers, these are often sellers under stress. Opening with “Tell me your story, what is going on?” builds trust. Sometimes the best fit is a retail sale, not a cash offer, yet that honest talk often wins the listing.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Armando G., a sponsor team member, built a system that closes more than twenty deals per month from Facebook ads. His story is simple. The ad gets the click, but the magic is in the conversation that follows. Consistent scripts and follow up turned paid leads into a predictable business.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If your current lead plan is “call once, blame the lead,” Making It Rain will work about as well as a treadmill used as a clothes rack. The power is in actually climbing on and pressing start.</p>\n<h2 id=\"making-it-rain-without-drowning-in-busywork\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About Making It Rain</h2>\n<h3 id=\"is-making-it-rain-required-to-succeed-at-e-xp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Making It Rain required to succeed at eXp Realty?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. Making It Rain is optional. Many agents at eXp Realty build successful businesses using referrals, sphere, and organic lead sources. Making It Rain exists for agents who want paid online lead generation without managing ad platforms themselves, not as a requirement for production or advancement.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-is-making-it-rain-best-suited-for\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is Making It Rain best suited for?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Making It Rain works best for agents who already have a functioning CRM, automation, and consistent follow-up habits. Paid leads require fast response and structured nurture. Agents without established systems may struggle to convert any PPC leads effectively, regardless of the source.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-making-it-rain-compare-to-third-party-ppc-vendors\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does Making It Rain compare to third-party PPC vendors?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Making It Rain centralizes PPC campaign management inside eXp Realty instead of outsourcing to outside vendors. Agents still fund advertising spend, but campaign setup, compliance, optimization, and CRM integration are handled internally, reducing complexity and minimizing the risk of policy or branding violations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"does-making-it-rain-replace-other-e-xp-realty-lead-programs\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does Making It Rain replace other eXp Realty lead programs?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. Making It Rain supplements other eXp Realty lead programs such as Revenos and Zoocasa. Each program serves a different function within the overall lead ecosystem, allowing agents to layer paid advertising alongside referral-based or structured lead sources.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-this-matters-before-you-join-e-xp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Programs like Making It Rain are designed to support agent-funded lead generation through structured campaigns, but they do not operate in isolation or replace the broader eXp Realty experience.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b182ea753238642b-Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp/public\" alt=\"Black and white photo of Karrie Hill and Doug Smart with the bold gold SAA logo overlaid, representing the leadership of Smart Agent Alliance.\" class=\"wp-image-267426 size-full\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp 499w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance-480x274.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life.

Agents are not charged referral fees at closing for these leads. Pricing structures, minimum budgets, and campaign options may vary and are subject to change based on program parameters.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752715957524\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Do Making It Rain leads affect commission splits or capping?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Transactions generated through Making It Rain close under the agent’s standard eXp commission split and count toward the annual cap in the same way as self-generated business. There are no additional referral deductions tied to these leads beyond normal brokerage terms.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752715975666\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Can Making It Rain campaigns be adjusted or paused?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. Agents can generally adjust budgets, targeting locations, and campaign focus through the Making It Rain platform, subject to program guidelines and availability. Flexibility allows agents to scale spending up or down based on capacity, market conditions, or changes in business priorities.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752715984636\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is Making It Rain available to new agents?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>New agents may access Making It Rain after licensing and onboarding at eXp Realty.
