The <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenos-leads\"><strong>Revenos Division</strong></a> provides eXp agents access to exclusive corporate, relocation, military, iBuyer, and institutional investor leads — not low-quality, recycled internet leads you’re forced to fight for at other brokerages.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>In 2024 alone, Revenos leads helped generate over $2 billion in closed sales for eXp agents.

While every agent gets eXp’s corporate tools, the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/basics\">best eXp sponsors</a> go way beyond that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you partner with teams like Smart Agent Alliance (also part of the Wolf Pack), you get a lot more lead generation firepower. More on that below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom line: With the right eXp sponsor, you’re not just getting leads &nbsp;&#8211; &nbsp;you’re building a lead generation machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-new-agents-at-e-xp-gain-confidence-faster\">Why New Agents at eXp Gain Confidence Faster</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s be honest &nbsp;&#8211; &nbsp;confidence in real estate doesn’t come from reading more contracts. It comes from knowing you’ve got a system that actually works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you have predictable lead generation built into your business from day one:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You’re not waking up every morning wondering where your next buyer or seller is hiding.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You follow a repeatable pipeline-building plan that fills your CRM while you focus on closings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You know exactly what to say, when to say it, and how to convert because you’ve rehearsed it in live coaching and weekly trainings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Instead of spinning your wheels for months, you’re stacking contracts within your first 90 days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why eXp Realty agents, especially those who plug into strong sponsor teams like Smart Agent Alliance, are closing deals while most new agents are still watching YouTube videos trying to figure it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lead-generation-is-the-1-reason-new-agents-succeed-or-quit\">Lead Generation Is the #1 Reason New Agents Succeed or Quit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s lay it out: most <strong>new real estate agents</strong> don’t quit because they’re lazy. They quit because they’ve got zero clue where their next client is coming from.

At its essence, it’s about identifying the intersection of shared interests that provides value for everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This process protects and helps both buyers and sellers. It enables them to negotiate on important items like price, closing costs, and repairs in good faith. In real estate, negotiations typically begin with an opener and proceed through stages, including counteroffers, before agreeing to terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meeting in person or talking over the phone can be critical when working out the details.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/What-are-Real-Estate-Negotiations.webp\" alt=\"What are Real Estate Negotiations\" class=\"wp-image-269225 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/What-are-Real-Estate-Negotiations.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/What-are-Real-Estate-Negotiations-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-negotiation-skills-matter\">Why Negotiation Skills Matter</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s why fierce negotiation skills are at the very core of winning clients the best possible deals. Good negotiators are<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> mediators</a>, able to diffuse tension and conflict by uncovering common ground and mutually beneficial solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They maintain a crucial advantage in the cutthroat commercial and residential real estate market, continuing to steer clear of fads and advisor disintermediation in a hyper-transactional marketplace. Rejecting a proposal doesn’t mean the end – doing so often just creates room for more negotiation and revision.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-elements-of-successful-negotiation\">Key Elements of Successful Negotiation</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Key-Elements-of-Successful-Negotiation.webp\" alt=\"Key Elements of Successful Negotiation\" class=\"wp-image-269221 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Key-Elements-of-Successful-Negotiation.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Key-Elements-of-Successful-Negotiation-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Key ingredients such as preparation, effective communication, and knowing what interests are at stake make for the best negotiations.

Smart real estate agents will look at the trends in their market and make smart decisions on the price points. This includes comparing the property with similar properties to determine a competitive asking price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, information about the sale price of other nearby homes with similar attributes can give you bargaining power during negotiations. Knowing your neighborhood’s dynamics, such as what developments are coming in, or what your school district’s rating is, makes your case much stronger.&nbsp; Not sure where to start?&nbsp; Check out your local MLS for stats or use <a href=\"https://www.narrpr.com/market-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RPR, Research tab, Residential Market Trends</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conduct-thorough-research\">Conduct Thorough Research</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, diligent research is the key to winning negotiations. By examining buyer demographics and preferences, real estate agents can adapt their strategies to align with what buyers are looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Researching comparable sales and current market conditions can provide a picture of the most effective approach to negotiation. In addition, putting together a list of potential buyer issues &#8211; like its condition or what amenities your community has &#8211; lets agents respond to objections before they’re raised.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"define-clear-goals\">Define Clear Goals</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Clearly defined, measurable goals are key to informing your negotiation priorities and discussions.

It’s less about having a rigid negotiation strategy, more about having a flexible plan that can adapt on the fly to the buyer’s reaction to the plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Develop a culture of collaboration and partnership to empower honest conversation and joint problem-solving. This is a great first step in changing the narrative from a zero-sum game to a more collaborative win-win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-master-the-push-pull-persist-technique\">1. Master the Push, Pull, Persist Technique</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The push, pull, persist approach is especially important in tough situations. This means presenting offers fairly but assertively, typically influenced by the first anchor offer, but still allowing for buyer counteroffer input.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Persisting keeps the conversation going even when there is pushback and allows negotiations to continue to be fruitful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-set-realistic-expectations\">2. Set Realistic Expectations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Establishing realistic expectations around price and terms is key. By educating clients on the current state of the market, you can set the right expectations and avoid disappointment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach also helps in developing patience and understanding during negotiations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-manage-emotions-and-stay-positive\">3. Manage Emotions and Stay Positive</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Arriving with a cool head makes for a constructive atmosphere. Identifying emotional triggers and defusing them with positive language and body language helps establish and maintain a positive environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-base-decisions-on-market-value\">4. Base Decisions on Market Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing valid market data to defend offers and counteroffers sets a fair price for negotiation. Analyzing like-kind properties and using those findings to inform negotiations strengthens negotiation positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This practice makes for stronger arguments during discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-be-ready-to-walk-away\">5. Be Ready to Walk Away</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Set client expectations around what it may mean to walk away from the deal if negotiations do not go as planned. By focusing on a strong BATNA, you increase your confidence in the deal and leverage your willingness to walk away.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"techniques-for-successful-communication\">Techniques for Successful Communication</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This is crucial in real estate negotiations. By listening to understand instead of reacting, we can learn what people really need and how we can best help them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clarity: Articulating thoughts clearly helps prevent misunderstandings, ensuring all parties are on the same page. These prompt deeper conversations and help agents peel back the layers of why a client is motivated and identify concerns below the surface.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Techniques-for-Successful-Communication.webp\" alt=\"Techniques for Successful Communication\" class=\"wp-image-269224 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Techniques-for-Successful-Communication.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Techniques-for-Successful-Communication-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"engage-in-direct-conversations\">Engage in Direct Conversations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct, honest dialogue reduces the risk of misinterpretation. There’s no substitute for the rapport built through face-to-face meetings, which help foster trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-questions-effectively\">Use Questions Effectively</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening with strategic questioning can help you uncover what is important to the buyer. By guiding conversations with open-ended questions, we arrive at collaborative, win-win solutions. Encourage questions so that clients can assure themselves that they understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"prefer-face-to-face-communication\">Prefer Face-to-Face Communication</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Face-to-face conversations are essential for developing trust. Agents should focus here first instead of spending a ton of time and money on digital strategies. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Non-verbal communication</a> provides a wealth of information in the negotiating process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arm-yourself-with-data\">Arm Yourself With Data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building argumentation positions with data is critical. Proven data and market research add credibility to your claims. Credibility rests on the issue of whether you’re presenting current information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leveraging-timing-and-offers\">Leveraging Timing and Offers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Timing is everything in real estate negotiations. When you know how the timing of your offers influences the course of negotiations, you give yourself an incredible advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a markdown table to illustrate the impact:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td>Timing of Offer</td><td>Impact on Negotiation</td></tr><tr><td>End of Fiscal Quarter</td><td>Landlords may offer favorable terms to close deals.</td></tr><tr><td>Slower Market Period</td><td>Less competition, potentially better deals for buyers.</td></tr><tr><td>Peak Season</td><td>Higher competition may result in more aggressive offers.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leverage-timing-for-advantage\">Leverage Timing for Advantage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Negotiating with the right timing in mind can produce a sense of urgency. Reverse timing your negotiation for the end of the fiscal quarter can play to your benefit. For many landlords, the mad dash to close deals starts this time of year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping an eye on market conditions helps you figure out the best times to make offers, matching buyer sentiment and market fluctuations. For example, winter is typically a slower time for the housing market, which means more favorable offers might be within reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding when these ups and downs happen puts you in the position to strike with laser-like focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"offer-multiple-choices\">Offer Multiple Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing more than one option increases decision-maker engagement and negotiation readiness. This method protects buyers’ needs and powers, while steering them toward the outcomes you want most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing the advantages of each choice makes it easier to compare and choose one. Showing alternative pricing models or payment plans can lure in prospective buyers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes them feel powerful, while at the same time leading them to a more favorable decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-escalation-clauses-effectively\">Use Escalation Clauses Effectively</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_clause\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Escalation clauses</a> are one way to make offers stronger &#8211; particularly in competitive situations. By structuring them smartly, you can protect your clients’ interests while signaling your good faith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These escalation clauses instantly ramp up your offer when faced with higher competing bids, showing you mean business. Even just setting a cap is a big first step to getting in control of your boundaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s how you win the date and keep the client’s budget healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"building-rapport-and-trust\">Building Rapport and Trust</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building rapport and trust with clients goes a long way in making successful real estate negotiations. Here&#8217;s a few ways to get started:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pay attention to what clients say and reflect back.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Empathy: Show understanding and share in their feelings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Personalized Communication: Tailor messages to make clients feel special.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Building-Rapport-and-Trust.webp\" alt=\"Building Rapport and Trust\" class=\"wp-image-269219 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Building-Rapport-and-Trust.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Building-Rapport-and-Trust-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk about non-work things to build rapport and trust. Make notes for birthdays, hobbies, family members, etc. By investing time in understanding clients’ needs and preferences, agents can demonstrate clients are valued and respected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casual chitchat prior to negotiating helps set a good mood, creating an environment where strong rapport can lead to better outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"foster-goodwill-through-reciprocity\">Foster Goodwill Through Reciprocity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating goodwill is another way to build trust. Providing concessions to counterparts can lead to greater collaboration and a continued spirit of cooperation. Experienced Fredericksburg realtors can best guide you through which concessions are fair and what they should look like given market trends and the condition of the property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Small acts of goodwill – an understanding with regards to timelines or fixing small repairs – can go a long way toward winning a buyer’s favor. This strategy underscores the value of reciprocity in negotiations and aids in building relationships that last well past the present transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"encourage-agreement-as-their-idea\">Encourage Agreement as Their Idea</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Making sure clients feel a sense of ownership over agreements will help boost their level of commitment. It is often possible to maneuver discussions to get clients to view settlements as their own solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Persuasive techniques that frame recommendations the right way can help deepen client engagement. Beyond fortifying the negotiation process, this tactic cultivates satisfaction with results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By empowering the client to be the decision-maker, agents will set themselves up for better negotiations and more robust client relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"maintain-transparency-and-ethical-practices\">Maintain Transparency and Ethical Practices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, transparency and honesty are key from start to finish during the negotiation process. Help clients avoid distractions, keep their eye on the financial prize, and always keep communication lines open. Offer impartial advice that keeps emotion from influencing important decisions. This level of consistent engagement helps make sure everyone is on the same page about the details, minimizing the chance for last-minute surprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"managing-offers-and-counteroffers\">Managing Offers and Counteroffers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Smartly managing offers and counteroffers is one of the most important parts of successful real estate negotiations. Best practices are to avoid surprises, be honest about limitations, and know the power of a personal touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acting quickly on received offers prevents losing momentum, meaning everyone involved stays excited and eager to move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Respond quickly to maintain interest.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Be clear and transparent about constraints.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use structured frameworks for clarity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prioritize face-to-face interactions when possible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow up verbal discussions with formal offers.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Managing-Offers-and-Counteroffers.webp\" alt=\"Managing Offers and Counteroffers\" class=\"wp-image-269222 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Managing-Offers-and-Counteroffers.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Managing-Offers-and-Counteroffers-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"present-offers-in-person\">Present Offers in Person</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Delivering offers in person conveys a sense of sincerity and seriousness. Most importantly, it allows you to address concerns on the spot, which makes the negotiation feel more personal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy builds mutual trust, which is crucial in any deep-dive transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"discuss-by-phone-first\">Discuss by Phone First</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These early phone conversations can help lay the groundwork for formal offers to come. They provide a way to hash out details and build rapport, making the jump to written communication much smoother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Putting it all down in writing with a formal offer goes a long way in memorializing the deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-a-framework-for-your-negotiation\">Use a Framework for Your Negotiation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A clear framework provides a roadmap for tough conversations, helping to keep negotiations on track. Important details, such as goals and timelines, as well as communication standards, keep everyone on track and working toward the same goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a big help in setting appropriate financial limits and bottom lines, which is key when you find yourself in a multiple offer scenario.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"advanced-negotiation-tactics\">Advanced Negotiation Tactics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastering advanced real estate negotiation tactics is key. Here are some advanced tactics to enhance your negotiation prowess:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Set a strong initial offer to anchor the discussion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reflect the other party’s language and behavior to build rapport.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use silence to prompt the other party to fill the gap.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bundling: Combine offers to create value for both parties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BATNA</a>: Know your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Advanced-Negotiation-Tactics.webp\" alt=\"Advanced Negotiation Tactics\" class=\"wp-image-269218 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Advanced-Negotiation-Tactics.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Advanced-Negotiation-Tactics-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>These strategies allow you to develop a negotiation approach that is fluid and flexible. You can also boost your negotiation prowess by taking the <a href=\"https://www.crendesignation.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Certified Real Estate Negotiator (CREN) course</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/education/designations-and-certifications/real-estate-negotiation-expert-rene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real Estate Negotiation Expert (RENE) certification</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.onlineed.com/catalog/652/Mastering-Real-Estate-Negotiations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OnlineEd’s Negotiation skills training</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"control-your-emotions\">Control Your Emotions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In high-stakes negotiations, staying calm under fire is key. When emotions take over rational thought, we tend to get the short end of the stick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By intentionally practicing mindfulness and reducing stress, you open yourself up to making better decisions without confusion or miscommunication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exhibit-patience-and-determination\">Exhibit Patience and Determination</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patience is important during negotiations, but it’s especially important during a seller’s market when multiple buyers are at play. A little time exploring the best possible choices will lead to better decisions, greater satisfaction, and often much better results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"apply-anchoring-techniques\">Apply Anchoring Techniques</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Anchoring greatly affects how we perceive and assign value. As the initial offer can set the anchor, this makes it a highly effective tactic in purely distributive negotiations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By strategically anchoring discussions, you can steer negotiations towards your ideal outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mastering-negotiations-stay-fresh\">Mastering Negotiations – Stay Fresh</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastering real estate negotiation is as much about preparation and strategy as it is about adaptability and communication.

Think timeless topics like &#8220;how-to&#8221; guides or industry insights that stay relevant year after year. A post on time management tips, for example, could be refreshed annually with updated examples. Skip outdated, hyper-specific pieces &#8211; like a blog tied to a 2024 event -unless you can adapt them to today’s trends.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888.webp\" alt=\"Hand holding a trophy against a golden bokeh background, symbolizing success for real estate agents during a recession.\" class=\"wp-image-4228 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888-300x133.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888-768x341.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Even older content can shine again with some tweaking.

Evergreen content grows stronger with updates, giving it an extended shelf life and new appeal.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"spot-high-performers\">Spot High Performers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your most engaging content is gold for repurposing. Use metrics like page views, social shares, and comments to pinpoint what resonates most. Aim to get at least five new pieces from one standout post to maximize its impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-on-whats-relevant\">Focus on What’s Relevant</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying relevant means knowing what your audience needs now.

Extract key insights or stats, pair them with eye-catching graphics, and you’ve got engaging posts. A single blog could yield at least five mini posts &#8211; an intro, a highlight of the main takeaway, a quote graphic, and more. For instance, if your blog goes live on Friday, use the following week to break it into smaller, focused posts for different platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transform-blogs-into-infographics\">Transform Blogs into Infographics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Infographics are a fantastic way to simplify complex topics. Pull out key data or concepts from your blog and collaborate with a designer to create visuals that captivate. Share these visuals on platforms like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_(media)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Pinterest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href=\"https://x.com/\">X</a> to reach more visual learners. Track metrics like shares and clicks to measure impact and refine future infographics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rework-blogs-into-email-newsletters\">Rework Blogs into Email Newsletters</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogs can supercharge your email campaigns. Break down posts into short, actionable tips, like turning a home buyer guide blog into a “3 Quick Tips” email segment. Personalize emails by segmenting your audience based on interests or behavior, making content feel targeted and relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-videos-from-blog-insights\">Create Videos from Blog Insights</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Videos can make your blog content pop.

For instance, a blog on “AI in Real Estate” could become a YouTube video, Instagram Reel, or TikTok clip.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-3.webp\" alt=\"Professional camera lens used by buyer agents for visual presentations\" class=\"wp-image-5598 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-3.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-3-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-blog-snippets-for-community-discussions\">Use Blog Snippets for Community Discussions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Short snippets from your blogs can spark meaningful conversations. Share quotes or thought-provoking questions in forums like LinkedIn groups or <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reddit</a>. For example, a blog on AI and real estate might inspire a question like, “How do you see AI shaping the future of real estate?”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"techniques-for-repurposing-video-content\">Techniques for Repurposing Video Content</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"break-long-videos-into-short-clips\">Break Long Videos into Short Clips</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Long videos are treasure troves of bite-sized gems that can shine as standalone content. Pull out the most impactful moments &#8211; memorable quotes, surprising facts, or actionable tips &#8211; and create short clips tailored for platforms like <a href=\"https://about.instagram.com/features/reels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram Reels</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TikTok</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@YouTube/shorts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube Shorts</a>. Adding captions ensures accessibility, while hashtags boost discoverability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"turn-video-content-into-interactive-slideshows\">Turn Video Content into Interactive Slideshows</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Transform videos into engaging slideshows or carousel posts for platforms like LinkedIn or Instagram. Extract the key points from your video and design them as visually appealing slides with concise takeaways. This is a great way to repurpose content for users who prefer skimming through visuals instead of watching full videos. Tools like <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva</a> or <a href=\"https://workspace.google.com/products/slides/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Slides</a> can streamline this process, making it quick and professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extract-key-points-for-blog-posts\">Extract Key Points for Blog Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Videos packed with educational value can easily translate into blog posts.

This not only creates additional content but also provides a clickable link back to the original video, driving traffic between platforms.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/22-Awesome-Real-Estate-Blog-Ideas-Get-More-clients.webp\" alt=\"22 Awesome Real Estate Blog Ideas Get More clients\" class=\"wp-image-262906 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/22-Awesome-Real-Estate-Blog-Ideas-Get-More-clients.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/22-Awesome-Real-Estate-Blog-Ideas-Get-More-clients-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/22-Awesome-Real-Estate-Blog-Ideas-Get-More-clients-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"convert-videos-into-podcasts\">Convert Videos into Podcasts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many audiences prefer to listen rather than watch, making podcasts a perfect way to repurpose video content. Strip the audio from interviews, tutorials, or panel discussions, clean it up, and add polished intros or transitions. Podcasts are especially effective for long-form discussions and can reach new listeners when distributed on platforms like <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a> or <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Podcasts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-video-stills-for-visual-posts\">Use Video Stills for Visual Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Screenshots from your videos can become eye-catching social media posts. Capture impactful moments &#8211; whether it’s a quote, stat, or emotional reaction &#8211; and pair them with text overlays or calls to action. These stills are perfect for Instagram, Pinterest, or even as thumbnails for emails, driving engagement with minimal effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compile-highlights-into-recap-videos\">Compile Highlights into Recap Videos</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of a month or campaign, pull highlights from multiple videos to create a recap reel. This can serve as a summary for your audience and to showcase your best content. Share these compilations on social media or email newsletters to re-engage your audience and remind them of the value you provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"approaches-for-repurposing-social-media-content\">Approaches for Repurposing Social Media Content</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"turn-stories-into-highlight-reels\">Turn Stories into Highlight Reels</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media stories are often short-lived but packed with engaging content. Repurpose the best moments into highlight reels for platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or YouTube. Combine a week’s worth of tips, behind-the-scenes footage, or FAQs into a cohesive reel that gives new life to your disappearing content. These highlights serve as evergreen resources for your audience and continue to attract engagement long after the original story expires.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"expand-comments-into-fa-qs\">Expand Comments into FAQs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media comments are a goldmine of audience questions and feedback. Compile the most common or insightful comments and turn them into an FAQ section for your website or a standalone blog post. For instance, questions from a popular Instagram Q&amp;A can evolve into a detailed guide or explainer video. This not only addresses audience curiosity but also reinforces your position as an expert in your niche.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"repurpose-polls-into-infographics\">Repurpose Polls into Infographics</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-3.webp\" alt=\"Highlighted word &#039;Repurpose&#039; with a marker on text, denoting strategic content repurposing in real estate YouTube marketing\" class=\"wp-image-4577 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-3.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-3-300x117.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-3-768x300.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Poll results on platforms like Instagram Stories or LinkedIn can be transformed into visually engaging infographics.

Clip key moments from the session, such as tips, audience questions, or insightful discussions, and share them as standalone videos. These snippets are ideal for social posts or as teasers to promote the replay of the full session.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"repurpose-d-ms-into-personal-stories\">Repurpose DMs into Personal Stories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct messages often include testimonials, questions, or feedback that can be repurposed (anonymously if needed) into compelling personal stories. Share these as part of your posts or emails to add a relatable, human touch to your content while showcasing your impact on your audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"methods-for-repurposing-newsletter-content\">Methods for Repurposing Newsletter Content</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"share-snippets-as-social-media-posts\">Share Snippets as Social Media Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your newsletter is packed with bite-sized wisdom perfect for social media.

Offering small but thoughtful perks can move people from “thinking about it” to “signing the offer.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Try:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Covering a home warranty</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offering a limited-time closing cost credit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Throwing in a local service &#8211; like free junk removal or moving help</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need to drop thousands.

Every happy buyer = a mini marketing team.<br>To activate them:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ask for a review the moment they’re happiest (hint: not at closing &#8211; try right after their offer is accepted)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Send a thank-you gift they’ll post on Instagram (local wine, home décor, custom address stamp)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Invite them to join your referral program and make it feel exclusive</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? Your buyers become brand ambassadors, and their network becomes your next pipeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"finding-real-buyers-isnt-magic-its-method\">Finding Real Buyers Isn’t Magic &#8211; It’s Method</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the truth: learning how to find buyers in real estate isn’t about shouting into the void and hoping someone bites.

Listing agents still get more control, less chaos, and let’s be real, less time chasing texts that start with “we’ve decided to wait.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, being a listing agent costs more upfront &#8211; photos, marketing, staging &#8211; but you’re also not spending your weekends unlocking doors for people whose “budget” is a Pinterest board and a dream. With the shift in buyer agent compensation (thanks NAR!), more buyers than ever are skipping agents altogether, but sellers? Sellers still need you. Badly. Especially if they want to avoid turning their property into a Zillow punchline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s get serious about how to get listings as a real estate agent, even if you’re new, rebuilding, or just tired of crossing your fingers at open houses.

Sellers don’t want a weather report &#8211; they want you to tell them whether it’s raining inside <em>their</em> zip code. So before you even <em>think</em> about sending another “Just Listed” postcard, do the homework.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"start-with-the-big-picture-a-k-a-why-your-sellers-are-freaked-out\">Start with the Big Picture (a.k.a.

Use that information when you:</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pull recent sales in the neighborhood and break them down by feature. Are homes with pools moving faster than homes with two-car garages? Is a remodeled kitchen getting offers in three days while grandma’s house with shag carpet sits for three months?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Look at days on market, sale-to-list ratio, and price-per-square-foot trends.

You earn them by being visible, credible, and freakishly consistent. Especially in a market where homeowners are bombarded by “I have a buyer for your home” flyers from agents who couldn’t find their own name on the MLS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whether you’re brand new and wondering how to get listings as a new real estate agent, or a seasoned pro looking to reboot, these listing strategies are designed to work now &#8211; not five years ago when inventory was falling out of the sky.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-offer-cash-deals-that-flip-the-script\">1.

Offer something simple: a home valuation QR code, a “what’s your home worth?” flyer, or just free bottled water.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Volunteer for local causes. Show you care about more than closing deals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to events even when you’re not promoting. Chat. Be seen. Be helpful.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Collect contact info (nicely).

In real estate, the words <em>broker</em> and <em>brokerage</em> get tossed around like interchangeable salad toppings &#8211; but they’re not the same thing.

A lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Issue.webp\" alt=\"best real estate brokerage for new agents Expired Listing Scripts, To learn more about eXp Realty, the only profitable publicly traded brokerage over the past five years, and holds the prestigious title of the best brokerage to work for.

A strong real estate brokerage gives you the training, tools, and support to survive those “what am I doing?” moments. One well-meaning broker can only help so much. The best brokerages offer real structure, real estate training for new agents, and resources that don’t vanish after your first week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"comparing-brokerage-models\">Comparing Brokerage Models</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best real estate brokerage for new agents isn’t one-size-fits-all. Different models come with different perks &#8211; and different landmines. Some offer full real estate coaching for new agents; others toss you a login and disappear. Here’s the short version of what you need to know:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cloud-based-brokerages\">Cloud-Based Brokerages</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Think eXp Realty &#8211; no offices (<a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/offices\">but access to offices</a>), no commute, just <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/training\">virtual training</a>, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/brokerage-fee\">strong tech</a><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/employees\">, support from anywhere</a>, and a whole lot of agent autonomy.

One office might have stellar real estate training for new agents, another has zippo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect lower commission splits (often 70/30 or worse), plus desk and franchise fees that chip away at your income. Ask detailed questions upfront &#8211; because you’re paying more, and what you get varies wildly. And, yes, online research about traditional brokerages is nearly impossible. Go to <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor.com</a> for some agent reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"local-independent-boutiques\">Local Independent Boutiques</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually run by a single broker, these offices might offer personalized mentorship, higher splits, and more autonomy than a franchise model. But training and tech depend entirely on the owner. If you like local vibes and direct access to leadership, this might be a fit. Just know that fewer staff means less support &#8211; and more is on you to figure out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"discount-or-flat-fee-models\">Discount or Flat-Fee Models</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Low-cost, high-split models sound great &#8211; until you need help. These brokerages charge per transaction or monthly, but usually offer minimal training or tech. Best for experienced agents, not those learning how to convert leads or write clean contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-roles-solo-team-or-sponsor-support\">Agent Roles: Solo, Team, or Sponsor Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve picked the best real estate brokerage for new agents, you still need to figure out how you’ll actually <em>work</em> inside that brokerage. You’ve got a few role options &#8211; and each one comes with its own mix of support, splits, and day-to-day reality.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/How-Does-a-Real-Estate-Team-Work-Solo-Agent-vs.-Team-Member-Which-Path-is-Right-for-You.png\" alt=\"How Does a Real Estate Team Work , Solo Agent vs. Team Member Which Path is Right for You\" class=\"wp-image-262895\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/How-Does-a-Real-Estate-Team-Work-Solo-Agent-vs.-Team-Member-Which-Path-is-Right-for-You.png 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/How-Does-a-Real-Estate-Team-Work-Solo-Agent-vs.-Team-Member-Which-Path-is-Right-for-You-300x53.png 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/How-Does-a-Real-Estate-Team-Work-Solo-Agent-vs.-Team-Member-Which-Path-is-Right-for-You-768x136.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Let’s break down your three main paths: going solo, joining a team, or leveraging sponsor support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"solo-agent\">Solo Agent</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most agents start out as solo agents. That means you’re running your own show under your brokerage’s umbrella. You pay the fees, generate the leads, and figure out your systems. You’re basically a one-person business with a real estate license and a dream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This setup works best if your real estate brokerage for new agents actually offers strong onboarding, tech, and training. Otherwise, “solo” turns into “struggling in silence” &#8211; which is exactly why <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/why-do-real-estate-agents-fail.asp#:~:text=Many%20real%20estate%20agents%20typically,reputation%20and%20gain%20new%20clients.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">so many new agents tap out in year one</a>. Some push through until the overwhelm hits, then pivot to a production team for support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-of-a-production-team\">Member of a Production Team</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/real-estate-agent-job/career/team-description\">Production teams</a> are usually the first thing new agents hear about because they’re common inside most brokerages. These teams operate like mini-businesses designed to help agents buy and sell homes more efficiently. They typically provide leads, hands-on training, accountability, and a built-in sense of community. For many new agents, joining a team can be a fast-track to building confidence and closing deals—without having to reinvent the wheel on day one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here’s the catch: not all teams are created equal. Just like with franchise offices and independent boutique brokerages, some teams offer legit training and support &#8211; others hand you a script and wish you luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Also, teams come with their own split <em>on top of</em> your brokerage split. So while the leads and mentorship might flow, your paycheck will shrink accordingly. Before joining, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/real-estate-agent-job/career/team-questions\">ask questions</a> about what you can expect and ask to see the team agreement &#8211; including how to exit. Some teams make it easy to leave. Others? Not so much.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"501\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Standard-Teams-The-Startup-Squad-with-Structure.webp\" alt=\"Standard Teams The Startup Squad with Structure, A proper agent task management setup helps you filter the noise.

When you join, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/basics\">you name a sponsor</a> &#8211; someone who benefits financially when you succeed. So in theory, they’re motivated to support you. In practice? Some do, some don’t. Everyone has time limits, so don’t count on endless hand-holding, especially from a solo sponsor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smart move? Choose a sponsor who offers actual value &#8211; like real estate coaching for new agents, marketing systems, or community &#8211; not just someone who slid into your DMs with “Let’s win together!” vibes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-of-a-sponsor-team\">Member of a Sponsor Team</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsor teams are also specific to brokerages with a <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share\">revenue share model</a>. These aren’t production teams &#8211; they don’t hold your hand through deals and most don’t take a split of your commissions. Instead, they provide tools, systems, and community designed to help you succeed as a solo agent. Think of it as an added layer of support – usually without an added layer of cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The catch? At brokerages like eXp Realty, you have to choose your sponsor team <a href=\"https://joinapp.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">when you join eXp</a>. After that, you’re locked in &#8211; unless you leave the company for a full year and come back. So yeah, doing your homework isn’t optional. On the upside, online research about eXp sponsors will help you decide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick a sponsor team that’s organized, offers real tools and systems, and actually supports your production and revenue share goals. A strong community? That’s the frosting on your commission cake – and yeah, it matters!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus: At eXp (and most other brokerages), sponsor team members can join a production team anytime. So if you start solo and realize you need a bit more structure (read: someone to boss you around in a helpful way), you can always become a production team member too. Just follow the advice above to make sure you’re picking the <em>right</em> team, not just the loudest one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-fees\">Commission Splits &amp; Fees</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll keep this quick &#8211; our other blogs go deep on commission math, hidden fees, and how to not feel broke after your first closing. This section is just the essentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1.webp\" alt=\"Woman holding a fan of hundred-dollar bills with a large green percentage sign, highlighting the debate over real estate commissions.\" class=\"wp-image-5382 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Commission splits are how your commission gets divided between you and your brokerage. The first number is <em>your</em> cut. So, if you&#8217;re on a 60/40 split, you keep 60%, and your brokerage takes 40%. Some brokerages use fixed splits, others use sliding scales that improve as you produce more. A few brokerages offer a cap &#8211; once you’ve paid in a set amount (<a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/100-percent\">like eXp’s $16K</a>), you keep 100% for the rest of the year.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The tradeoff? Lower splits sometimes come with more support &#8211; like leads, training, and tech. Higher splits usually mean you’re more independent (read: figuring things out solo).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s talk fees &#8211; tech fees, desk fees, franchise fees, transaction fees. Some brokerages charge monthly. Others take a cut per deal. It all adds up fast, especially when you&#8217;re still ramping up. You can compare these for yourself using our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/traditional\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any event, before you commit to a brokerage, ask for a detailed fee sheet: upfront, monthly, and per-transaction. Then check out our blogs on <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging&#039;/real-estate-agent-job/career/commissions\">commission splits</a> and <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging&#039;/best-real-estate-brokerage/fees\">fees</a> so you know what you’re really taking home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-factors-for-new-agent-success\">Key Factors for New Agent Success</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you’ve got a grip on brokerage types, splits, and fees, it’s time to talk about what <em>really</em> drives your success in this business. Because let’s be real &#8211; the best real estate brokerage for new agents isn’t the one with the flashiest office or the prettiest signs. It’s the one that actually sets you up to close deals, stay sane, and make it past year one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good fit means more than a name you recognize. It means real estate training for new agents that doesn’t suck, support when you hit a wall, and tools that actually help &#8211; not just look good in a sales pitch. These are the six key factors that separate thriving agents from the ones quietly ghosting their license renewal notices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-training-onboarding\">1. Training &amp; Onboarding</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting licensed teaches you how not to break the law. But getting trained teaches you how to actually sell houses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great brokerages start with a clear onboarding process (for example, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/onboarding\">here’s eXp’s</a>) and continue with real estate coaching for new agents that includes contracts, negotiations, scripts, and even how to survive your first open house without crying in the bathroom. In competitive markets that includes local rules, city-specific disclosures, and hands-on practice &#8211; not just theory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for brokerages that go beyond “read this PDF.” Weekly live sessions, role-playing, deal debriefs, shadowing top producers &#8211; that’s where the growth happens. And if they throw in a video library for after-hours studying? Bonus points.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-mentorship-thats-actually-useful\">2. Mentorship That’s Actually Useful</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A true mentor doesn’t just sit near you and hope you learn by osmosis. The best real estate brokerages for new agents match you with someone who actually has time to answer questions, offer feedback, and walk you through awkward scenarios (like what to say when your buyer suddenly wants to “think about it” mid-escrow).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask if the mentorship is structured &#8211; how often you meet, what’s covered, and how mentors are selected. Vague “you’ll have support” promises are a red flag. You need someone who can spot your blind spots and help you build your skills, not just collect a fee on your closings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-supportive-company-culture\">3. Supportive Company Culture</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New agents fail most often because they feel isolated and overwhelmed. That’s where company culture comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>A supportive brokerage means open-door managers, collaborative agents, tech help that actually shows up, and a place where asking questions isn’t treated like a weakness. Culture shows up in little things &#8211; who’s willing to share scripts, who answers your Slack messages, and whether there’s a community that makes you feel like you’re not doing this alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you join, talk to other agents. Ask what support really looks like. You’ll feel the vibe pretty quickly.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Synergstic-Community-2.webp\" alt=\"eXp Realty Team Synergistic Community 2\" class=\"wp-image-263072 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Synergstic-Community-2.webp 450w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Synergstic-Community-2-300x200.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-tech-that-works-and-helps\">4. Tech That Works (And Helps)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern real estate runs on systems. Your brokerage should give you access to tools like a solid CRM, digital marketing tools, and listing tech that doesn’t look like it’s from 2005.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At minimum, look for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>CRM with follow-up automation (like <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/boldtrail\">Boldtrai</a>l or similar)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Email and text drips</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social media content tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li>eSign and <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/skyslope\">transaction management systems</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Virtual office platforms for training and collaboration</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because tech that works means less time in paperwork purgatory and more time closing deals &#8211; or, let’s be honest, generating leads to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-lead-generation-support\">5. Lead Generation Support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Leads are the lifeline of a new agent’s business. The best real estate companies for new agents don’t just say “go find clients” &#8211; they help you do it (like <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenos-leads\">Revenos</a> at eXp).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That could mean PPC ads, relocation referrals, open house strategies, or sphere marketing tools. Some brokerages offer leads directly, others coach you on how to generate and convert them. The key is understanding what systems are in place &#8211; and what’s expected of you to make them work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask: Are leads provided? Is there training on conversion? And do I pay extra for them?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-long-term-growth-opportunities\">6. Long-Term Growth Opportunities</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it’s about closing your first deal &#8211; but it’s also about what happens after deal #10. The best real estate brokerage firms for beginners also help you plan your next chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Coaching to scale into a team leader role</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Management tracks or specialist positions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Continued education (marketing, negotiation, compliance)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Conferences, masterminds, and skill-building events</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If your brokerage only focuses on the next deal, they’re not planning for your future. Ask about growth paths before you join.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"choose-the-brokerage-that-sets-you-up-to-win\">Choose the Brokerage That Sets You Up to Win</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to the best real estate brokerage for new agents &#8211; but there is one universal truth: support matters more than hype. You need a brokerage that actually trains you, supports you when you&#8217;re stuck, and helps you grow beyond just your first deal. We’ve got way more info to help you <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage\">compare what different brokerages actually offer</a> and most of it is nearly impossible to find through basic online searches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of brokerages…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you choose <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/smart-agent-alliance\">Smart Agent Alliance</a> as your sponsor at eXp Realty, you don’t just get the most agent-forward brokerage in the game.

The top mistake? Thinking you’ll “just remember.” And then you don’t. One missed call, one forgotten contract, and poof &#8211; there goes the deal. Real estate agent time management isn’t optional; it’s the entire ball game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering what software do real estate agents use to stay on track?

Fast, clean, and surprisingly functional. It’s designed to help eXp agents get fully equipped with the tools, training, and support needed to start buying and selling homes fast (translation: get paid sooner).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you walk in blind without knowing how it works? You could be in for a world of confusion &#8211; and maybe even regret.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s break it down. <strong>Here’s a recap of the 6 key eXp Realty onboarding steps we’ll cover in detail below:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pick a Sponsor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fill out the Join eXp Application</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wait for Active Status</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Receive Sponsor Value</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optional Co-Sponsor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>eXp’s Official 8 Day Onboarding Kicks Off</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-1-pick-a-sponsor-carefully-seriously\">Step 1: Pick a Sponsor (Carefully. Seriously.)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If we sound like a broken record here, good. Because picking your <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/basics\">eXp sponsor</a> is the most important decision you’ll make outside of “should I become a real estate agent in the first place?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s why: most eXp Realty agents never realize how much sponsor support varies until it’s too late – and then they have <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/sponsor-regrets\">agent sponsor regrets</a>. Most eXp sponsors offer nothing. Others, like Smart Agent Alliance, offer an entire ecosystem of tools, mentorship, training, marketing help, and production support. We’re talking real support &#8211; not “give me a call if you need something.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eXp-Onboarding-Step-1-Pick-a-Sponsor.webp\" alt=\"eXp Onboarding Step 1, Pick a Sponsor\" class=\"wp-image-268703 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eXp-Onboarding-Step-1-Pick-a-Sponsor.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eXp-Onboarding-Step-1-Pick-a-Sponsor-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Pro tip: This sponsor choice includes the sponsor you name and their full upline of 6 more agents.&nbsp; So, don’t blow this. Choose a sponsor who’s part of a strong upline team. Lone-wolf agents can’t give you the kind of leverage that team sponsors with layers of support (like us) can. It&#8217;s the difference between plugging into a system… or being left Googling “how to get started as a real estate agent” at 1 a.m.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Quick heads-up on common confusion:<br>Your eXp sponsor is <em>not</em> the same as a production team leader or mentor. Some agents make this confusing on purpose (shocker), especially if they’ve built a fancy site around their local production team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sponsor teams – You must name them when you apply to eXp. They offer various levels of agent support (ranging from “literally nothing” to “why didn’t I join this sooner?”). They cost you $0.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production teams – You join them anytime after you’re an active eXp agent. They’re great for day-to-day transaction help &#8211; but they take 25%+ of your commission.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-2-fill-out-the-join-e-xp-application\">Step 2: Fill Out the Join eXp Application</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve picked your sponsor (hi, hopefully us), you’ll go to the Join eXp application. Here’s what happens next:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 44%\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>First, if you have any trouble with your application, reach out to eXpert Care at 833-303-0610 or contact your sponsor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access the <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official Join Us</a> platform through eXp’s website.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fill it out completely. Double-check that your name matches your real estate license exactly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Name your sponsor (don’t skip this &#8211; if you leave it blank, you don’t get a do-over.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up direct deposit and upload your W-9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Read and sign your Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) – this defines your business relationship with eXp Realty. Not exactly beach reading, but it matters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Submit – your application is reviewed by eXp Onboarding (usually within 24 hours)</li>\n</ol>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eXp-Onboarding-Step-2-Fill-Out-the-Join-eXp-Application.webp\" alt=\"eXp Onboarding Step 2, Fill Out the Join eXp Application\" class=\"wp-image-268704 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eXp-Onboarding-Step-2-Fill-Out-the-Join-eXp-Application.webp 498w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eXp-Onboarding-Step-2-Fill-Out-the-Join-eXp-Application-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-3-wait-for-active-status\">Step 3: Wait for Active Status</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your app is approved by eXp Onboarding, it gets passed to your <strong>state broker</strong>, who pulls your license from your old brokerage or your state department of real estate if you’re brand new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That process usually takes <strong>48 &#8211; 72 hours</strong>, depending on your state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, don’t just refresh your inbox 37 times a day. Instead:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ask your sponsor for an <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/exp-world\">eXp World pass</a> – take a tour, click around</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get your <strong>professional photos</strong> done – you’ll need them for your marketing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Haven’t heard anything from eXp in 4 days? Call <strong>eXpert Care</strong> (833-303-0610) and ask to speak to onboarding.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-4-receive-sponsor-value\">Step 4: Receive Sponsor Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Congrats &#8211; you’re now an active <strong>eXp Realty agent</strong>. This is where it gets real.<br>If you chose a sponsor who actually delivers (like Smart Agent Alliance), this is when the good stuff kicks in &#8211; and it’s all free:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Private 1-on-1 onboarding call</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production help with top courses and live tips</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Revenue share support for passive income</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Community, connection, motivation, inspiration</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to training, tools, and templates</li>\n</ol>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Step-4-Receive-Sponsor-Value.webp\" alt=\"Step 4, Receive Sponsor Value\" class=\"wp-image-268706 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Step-4-Receive-Sponsor-Value.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Step-4-Receive-Sponsor-Value-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But if your sponsor ghosted you… or you didn’t realize that naming a sponsor on your application locked in your access to a full <strong>upline team</strong> and not just one person, yeah &#8211; it stings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news? You’re not completely out of luck. You still have one more card to play: the <strong>co-sponsor</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-5-optional-co-sponsor\">Step 5: Optional Co-Sponsor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve got <strong>5 days</strong> from the date you become active to name a <strong>co-sponsor</strong> if you’d like one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a second layer of support &#8211; totally optional, but potentially helpful if you want to add a <strong>local connection</strong> or <strong>specific skillset</strong> to your corner. Think of it as filling in the gaps your primary sponsor team doesn’t meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind: a co-sponsor can only offer individual support &#8211; not the full upline structure that comes with the primary sponsor you named on your eXp application. But if you choose wisely, the right co-sponsor can still bring meaningful value, mentorship, and strategic help to your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need help finding one? Use the eXp directory to search by location and find someone whose vibe actually fits. Then <em>call them</em>. Ask what they’re willing to offer you &#8211; for free. Because handing over part of your revenue to someone who’s not lifting a finger?
