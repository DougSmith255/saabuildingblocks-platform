    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Century 21 vs Keller Williams to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-century-21-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Century 21 vs Keller Williams</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<div style=\"height: 8px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Keller Williams offers flexible splits ranging from 70/30 to 100/0, with a 6% franchise/royalty fee until the cap is reached. Century 21 provides splits starting at 70/30 and going up to 92/8, with an 8% franchise/royalty fee that continues even after the cap is reached.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees for Keller Williams vary by office, whereas Century 21’s fees range from $0 to $350 per month. Additionally, Keller Williams does not charge transaction fees, while Century 21 includes transaction fees within their royalty fees. These differences can impact an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning, making it important to consider each brokerage&#8217;s fee structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Keller Williams stands out by offering revenue share programs that provide a retirement and willable income path. These additional income streams can offer substantial long-term financial benefits and security. Conversely, Century 21 does not offer such supplementary income opportunities, limiting agents primarily to their commission-based earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Keller Williams excels in this area, providing extensive training opportunities, though specific details on the extent of their offerings are not standardized across all offices. Agents at Keller Williams also benefit from various support structures, although 24/7 support is not available. In contrast, Century 21 provides training that varies by office and lacks the extensive and consistent support system available at Keller Williams. This difference can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Keller Williams is known for its robust technology platforms, offering tools that enhance productivity and client engagement. On the other hand, Century 21 only incorporates some technological tools. Both brokerages focus heavily on traditional, physical office spaces. Both might appeal to agents who prefer a more conventional working environment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Keller Williams boasts a high Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars based on 7.9K reviews, indicating strong agent approval and satisfaction. Century 21 holds a respectable 4.2-star rating from 1.5K reviews, though this suggests there are areas needing improvement. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-century-21-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Century 21 vs Keller Williams</h3>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.century21.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Century 21</a> and<a href=\"https://www.kw.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Keller Williams</a>, it’s evident that Keller Williams offers more favorable commission splits, extensive training, and additional income opportunities, making it a compelling choice for both new and experienced agents. The innovative technology and comprehensive support further enhance Keller Williams&#8217; appeal. Century 21, while offering a traditional structure with some technological integration, has higher fees and fewer income paths, which may limit its appeal to agents seeking comprehensive support and modern business solutions.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison and to find the best brokerage for your needs, check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.</p>\n<p>When making your decision, consider your specific needs and career objectives.

What&#8217;s the next move? Choosing the right brokerage can be a game-changer. Plus, it’s a decision that’s more complex than ever due to all the real estate industry disrupters.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to unpack here. Let&#8217;s kick things off by understanding the different brokerage models currently making waves.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traditional-brokerage-models\">Traditional brokerage models</h3>\n<p>Think classic franchise setup with brick-and-mortar offices where broker-owners manage recruitment. It’s the old-school way that is currently still very much in play.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"discount-traditional-brokerage-models\">Discount traditional brokerage models</h3>\n<p>Similar in vibe to traditional, but with a twist. That twist? Lower costs for clients and, yep, lower earnings for agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hybrid-brokerage-models\">Hybrid brokerage models</h3>\n<p>These guys mix it up with physical offices and tech boosts. This model aims to lower costs through tech without ditching the office vibe completely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cloud-based-brokerage-models\">Cloud-based brokerage models</h3>\n<p>The new kids on the block! These models ditch physical offices completely, cutting down middlemen and overhead. They’re all about using tech to streamline operations and empower agents like you to lead the way in recruitment.</p>\n<p>Each model has its perks, depending on what you&#8217;re looking for. The brokerage model you choose will shape your career path. Let’s make sure it’s a shape you like!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-career-advantage\">Your Career Advantage</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 63%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Before we get into the brokerage interview questions, there’s something else you should know. That is, interviewing for a real estate agent position is not like interviewing for most other jobs.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/bab8114f046c5633-Your-Career-Advantage.webp/public\" alt=\"Rocket flying ahead of paper airplanes, symbolizing career advantage and the importance of asking brokerage interview questions.\" class=\"wp-image-243261 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage-300x92.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage-768x235.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Why? Because you’re a revenue generator for any brokerage through your hard-earned commissions and the fees you pay to your brokerage. Additionally, most of your business expenses come out of your pocket, not your brokerages. So, unlike other jobs, real estate brokerages incur minimal costs when they bring you on board.</p>\n<p>But here’s the twist: if you&#8217;re a new agent, the time invested in training you and meeting your day-to-day questions is huge. If a brokerage isn&#8217;t hiring, or if they pass on offering you a position, it’s likely due to a lack of structured training or adequate staff to support your growth.</p>\n<p>This happens more commonly in franchise brokerages or smaller outfits. That’s because even if t the responsibility for answering your day-to-day questions often falls on just one person &#8211; the broker-owner of the franchise office. Hiring you depends on that broker’s time availability.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, this time for new agents problem is better with some cloud-based brokerages. These modern setups often have dedicated staff ready to support new agents.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at a cloud-based brokerage, the hiring process can be remarkably streamlined. Sometimes you can join the brokerage through just a simple online application, bypassing traditional interviews altogether.</p>\n<p>This makes it easier and faster to kickstart your real estate career. But, before you hit the join button, be sure to get the brokerage interview questions answered.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evaluating-responses\">Evaluating Responses</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:55% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a561e15bfc219c7a-Evaluating-Responses.webp/public\" alt=\"Person looking up at a light bulb and question marks drawn on a chalkboard, representing evaluating responses to brokerage interview questions.\" class=\"wp-image-243258 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Evaluating-Responses.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Evaluating-Responses-300x116.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Evaluating-Responses-768x297.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Last, before we get to the brokerage interview questions, let&#8217;s talk about how to really listen to the answers you&#8217;ll get.

Discount traditional brokerage models are those that discount their services and what agents earn. Hybrid brokerage models mix it up with physical offices and tech boosts to lower costs. Cloud-based brokerage models ditch physical offices completely, cutting down middlemen and overhead. They’re all about using tech to streamline operations.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">How is interviewing as a real estate agent different than other professions?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">It’s different because agents generate revenue for the brokerage through commissions while paying fees and most business expenses themselves, minimizing costs for the brokerage. However, the time investment in training new agents and addressing daily inquiries is substantial. Cloud-based brokerages better accommodate new agents with dedicated support staff and streamlined hiring processes, sometimes allowing agents to join through a simple online application, eliminating traditional interviews.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What real estate brokerage interview questions should I ask?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Ask about commission splits, fees, training, technology, lead generation, marketing support, stock rewards, mentorship, networking opportunities, company culture, and agent perks like: healthcare, retirement plans, and recruiting bonuses. Also ask how much the company innovates, how profitable is the company after expenses, and are their client perks like global advertising or renovations where the associated costs are zero until closing.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

This comprehensive guide on how to obtain a California real estate license will walk you through each step, ensuring you’re well-prepared to start your real estate career in California. Let’s get started on your journey to becoming a licensed real estate agent.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#basic-requirements\">Understand the Basic Requirements</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-1\">Step 1: Take a Real Estate Pre-Licensing Course</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-2\">Step 2: Submit Your California Real Estate License Application</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-3\">Step 3: Pass the California Real Estate Exam</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-4\">Step 4: Complete the Fingerprinting Requirement</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-5\">Step 5: Submit the Salesperson License Application</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-6\">Step 6: Find a Real Estate Broker to Sponsor You</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#find-a-sponsoring-broker\">Find a Sponsoring Broker</a></li>\n</ol>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"basic-requirements\">Understand the Basic Requirements</h2>\n<p>Before diving into the specifics, it’s essential to understand the basic requirements for a California real estate license. These are the fundamental criteria you must meet:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Age Requirement</h3>\n<p>You must be at least 18 years old to apply for a real estate license in California. This age requirement ensures that applicants have reached a level of maturity and legal responsibility necessary for the profession.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Residency and Identification</h3>\n<p>While you don’t need to be a California resident to obtain a license, you must have a Social Security number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). This identification is crucial for background checks and to ensure compliance with state regulations. Out-of-state applicants for a California real estate license must meet the same criteria as California residents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Honesty and Integrity</h3>\n<p>You must be honest and truthful in all your dealings. The California Department of Real Estate (DRE) will conduct a thorough background check, and any conviction of a crime may result in the denial of your license. Being upfront about any past legal issues and demonstrating rehabilitation can positively impact your application.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-1\">Step 1: Take a Real Estate Pre-Licensing Course</h2>\n<p>In California, you need to complete <strong>135 hours of real estate pre-licensing education</strong>. This course covers essential topics like real estate principles, practices, and legal aspects.</p>\n<p><em>“Any real estate practice course submitted for purposes of qualifying to take a real estate license exam, must include components on implicit bias and fair housing. Additionally, the fair housing component must include an interactive participatory component where the applicant role plays as both the consumer and the real estate professional.” <a href=\"https://www.dre.ca.gov/Examinees/RequirementsSales.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">-DRE</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Course Breakdown</h3>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Real Estate Principles (45 hours)</h4>\n<p>This course covers the fundamentals of real estate, including property ownership, land use controls, and regulations. Understanding these principles is essential for anyone entering the real estate field.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Real Estate Practice (45 hours)</h4>\n<p>Real Estate Practice focuses on the practical aspects of working as a real estate agent. Topics include listing agreements, sales processes, and client relationships. This course prepares you for the day-to-day activities you will encounter in your real estate career.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Elective Course (45 hours)</h4>\n<p>The elective course allows you to specialize in an area of interest, such as Real Estate Finance, Real Estate Appraisal, or Property Management. Choosing an elective that aligns with your career goals can provide a competitive edge.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing the Right School</h3>\n<p>Selecting the right California real estate school is crucial. Look for accredited schools that offer flexibility, especially if you have a busy schedule. Online real estate courses in California can provide the convenience of studying at your own pace.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Schools:</strong> Start by researching various California real estate schools and reading reviews from past students. Look for schools with high pass rates for the real estate exam and positive feedback on their teaching methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider Online vs. In-Person:</strong> Decide whether you prefer online or in-person real estate classes in California. Online courses offer flexibility and convenience, allowing you to study at your own pace. In-person classes provide direct interaction with instructors and peers, which can enhance your learning experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate Course Materials:</strong> Evaluate the course materials and support services provided by the school. High-quality textbooks, interactive lessons, and access to instructors for questions can significantly impact your success.

Focus on areas where you feel less confident to ensure a well-rounded preparation.</p>\n<p><strong>Take Practice Exams:</strong> Take as many practice exams as possible. This helps you get familiar with the exam format and identify areas where you need more study. (<a href=\"https://realestatelicensewizard.com/california-real-estate-practice-exam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free California Real Estate Practice Exam</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Join Study Groups:</strong> Join or form study groups. Discussing topics with peers can enhance understanding and retention. Study groups provide a platform to share knowledge, ask questions, and support each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider Exam Prep Courses:</strong> Consider enrolling in an exam prep course for additional support and structured study. These courses often include practice exams, study guides, and expert instruction.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tips for Exam Day</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Arrive Early:</strong> Ensure you arrive at the exam center early to avoid any last-minute stress. Check the location and travel time in advance.</li>\n<li><strong>Bring Valid ID:</strong> You’ll need a valid photo ID to enter the exam. Make sure your ID is current and matches the name on your application.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay Calm:</strong> Read each question carefully and manage your time wisely. Staying calm and composed can help you think clearly and avoid mistakes.</li>\n<li><strong>Follow Instructions:</strong> Follow all instructions given by the exam proctors. If you have any questions or issues, ask the proctors for assistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-4\">Step 4: Complete the Fingerprinting Requirement</h2>\n<p>After passing the exam, you must complete a fingerprinting requirement for a background check. This is a mandatory step to ensure you meet the honesty and integrity standards set by the DRE.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live Scan Process</h3>\n<p><strong>Find a Provider:</strong> Use a Live Scan service provider approved by the California Department of Justice. Live Scan is an electronic fingerprinting process that is fast and secure. Locate a service provider near you and schedule an appointment. (You can get this done at UPS for $65)</p>\n<p><strong>Submit Required Forms:</strong> Fill out and submit the RE Form 237 (<a href=\"https://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/forms/re237.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a>) along with the fingerprinting fee. The Live Scan service provider will electronically transmit your fingerprints to the Department of Justice. Keep a copy of the form and receipt for your records.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay the Fee:</strong> Be prepared to pay the fingerprinting fee, which varies by provider. The fee typically includes the cost of the Live Scan service and the background check. Confirm the total cost when scheduling your appointment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background Check</h3>\n<p>The DRE will conduct a background check using your fingerprints. This check ensures you meet the honesty and integrity standards required for a real estate license. Any issues identified during the background check may need to be addressed before your license is granted.</p>\n<p>If any issues arise during the background check, be prepared to provide additional documentation or explanations. Demonstrating honesty and taking responsibility for past actions can positively impact the DRE’s decision. Seek legal advice if necessary to navigate any complex issues.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-5\">Step 5: Submit the Salesperson License Application</h2>\n<p>The next step is to submit the Salesperson License Application. This application confirms that you have passed the exam and completed the fingerprinting requirement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Application Process</h3>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complete the Form:</strong> Fill out the form available on the <a href=\"https://www.dre.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DRE website</a>. Ensure all sections are completed accurately.</li>\n<li><strong>Include Exam Results:</strong> Include proof that you passed the exam. This documentation is crucial for the DRE to verify your eligibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Attach Live Scan Form:</strong> Attach your Live Scan Service form. This proof confirms that you have completed the fingerprinting requirement.</li>\n<li><strong>Pay the Fee:</strong> As of 2023, the fee is $245. This fee must be submitted along with your application.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After submitting your application, you can track its status online through the DRE’s website. Regularly checking the status can help you stay informed about any updates or additional requirements.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-6\">Step 6: Find a Real Estate Broker to Sponsor You</h2>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"find-a-sponsoring-broker\">Find a Sponsoring Broker</h2>\n<p>Once you pass the exam, you need to find a sponsoring broker to activate your license. Look for a brokerage that aligns with your goals and offers the support you need.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Look for in a Brokerage</h3>\n<p><strong>Culture and Environment:</strong> Find a supportive and collaborative environment. The right culture can significantly impact your job satisfaction and success.</p>\n<p><strong>Commission Structure:</strong> Understand the financial arrangements. Different brokerages offer different commission splits, so choose one that suits your financial goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Training and Support:</strong> Choose a broker who provides ample training and mentorship opportunities. Early career support is crucial for your development and success.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions to Ask During Interviews</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What training programs do you offer for new agents?</li>\n<li>How does your commission split work, and are there any additional fees?</li>\n<li>What kind of support and resources will I have access to?</li>\n<li>Can you provide references from other agents in your brokerage?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more interview preparation, check out our guide on <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/brokerage-interview-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">17 Brokerage Interview Questions</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top Brokerages to Consider</h3>\n<p>Choosing the right broker is crucial as it impacts your early career significantly.

Hint: it’s not cheap to start out in real estate.</p>\n<p>Starting a career in real estate across the U.S. involves several initial expenses and requires careful financial planning. Here’s a breakdown of typical costs and planning tips:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Starting Costs</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Initial Expenses</strong>: Includes licensing fees, marketing expenses, office supplies, and technology tools. Typical costs might be:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pre-Licensing Course</strong>: $99-$700</li>\n<li><strong>Exam Fee</strong>: $60 per attempt</li>\n<li><strong>Application Fee</strong>: $245</li>\n<li><strong>Fingerprinting Fee</strong>: Approximately $60</li>\n<li><strong>Marketing Materials</strong>: Costs for business cards, signage, and online advertising</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Professional Memberships</strong>:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>National Association of Realtors (NAR)</strong>: Annual dues approximately $156, plus a $45 special assessment for the Consumer Advertising Campaign, totaling around $201.</li>\n<li><strong>State and Local Associations</strong>: Membership fees can vary. Typically, local Realtor association fees range from $200 to $300 annually.<strong>Multiple Listing Service (MLS)</strong>: Fees can vary significantly by region. Generally, expect to pay anywhere from $300 to $500 annually.<strong>Supra Key Fees</strong>: Include an initial setup fee and a monthly or annual service fee, generally around $50 for setup and $20 to $25 per month for service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Budgeting Tips</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Create a Budget</strong>: Track expenses and forecast income, planning for slower months to maintain financial stability.</li>\n<li><strong>Emergency Fund</strong>: Set aside funds to cover unexpected costs or slow periods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Income Management</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commission Structure</strong>: Real estate agents earn through sales commissions. Commission splits vary widely, typically from 50/50 to 80/20 or higher, depending on the brokerage.</li>\n<li><strong>Tax Planning</strong>: As an independent contractor, keep track of deductible expenses, make estimated tax payments, and maintain good records. Consult a tax professional to ensure compliance and optimize tax strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These estimates are subject to change and can vary by location and specific circumstances. Always check local regulations and consult with local Realtor associations for the most accurate and up-to-date information.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-get-a-real-estate-license\">How to get a Real Estate License – Basic Requirements</h2>\n<p>Generally, all states require a high school diploma or equivalent, U.S. citizenship, proof of state residency, and completion of state-approved pre-licensing courses. Additionally, many states mandate a background check and may require proof of errors and omissions insurance.</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Age</strong>: Most states require applicants to be at least 18 years old. Some states, like New York, require applicants to be at least 20 years old to become a broker.</li>\n<li><strong>Education</strong>: A high school diploma or equivalent is typically required. Additionally, applicants must complete state-approved pre-licensing courses, which cover real estate principles, laws, and practices. The number of required hours varies by state, ranging from 40 to 180 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Residency</strong>: Applicants must be permanent residents of the state in which they are applying for the license.</li>\n<li><strong>Background Check</strong>: Most states require a criminal background check to ensure the applicant has no disqualifying criminal history.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-Licensing Education</strong>: Completion of pre-licensing education is mandatory. The specific number of hours and the content of these courses depend on state regulations. For example, New York requires 77 hours of coursework for agents and 152 hours for brokers.</li>\n<li><strong>Examination</strong>: Applicants must pass a state licensing exam that tests their knowledge of real estate laws, practices, and principles. The exam typically includes both national and state-specific sections.</li>\n<li><strong>Sponsorship</strong>: In some states, like New York, applicants must be sponsored by a licensed real estate broker to activate their license.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additional Considerations</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>License Reciprocity</strong>: Some states have reciprocity agreements with other states, which can simplify the licensing process for those already licensed elsewhere.

Sure, commission splits are a huge part of it, but the resources, training, support, and even the day-to-day experience you’ll have as an agent are equally important.</p>\n<p>Picking the right brokerage means finding the one that fits your style, goals, and needs—and of course, helps you maximize your income.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing eXp Realty and Corcoran, two widely recognized real estate brands. While eXp Realty is known for its transparency, you might have to dig deeper for some of the details on Corcoran, but no worries—we’ve done the homework for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e998dad4c07b028a-Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>One key way to gauge how happy you’ll be at a brokerage is by checking out agent satisfaction. According to <strong>Glassdoor</strong>, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds a fantastic <strong>4.6-star rating</strong>, while <strong>Corcoran</strong> isn’t far behind with <strong>4.4 stars</strong>.</p>\n<p>Both companies clearly have satisfied agents, but it’s important to think about why. This can come down to support, resources, and overall company culture. And we all know that happier agents tend to be more successful agents.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a37cf1e2cc5b6038-Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why does profitability matter? Because a financially stable brokerage can keep offering you great tools, training, and support without cutting corners. When a brokerage is in the red, it’s not uncommon for agents to feel the pinch.</p>\n<p><strong>Corcoran</strong> is part of Anywhere Real Estate, a large holding company that also includes brands like Sotheby’s, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Century 21, and Coldwell Banker. As a group, Anywhere has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong> with <strong>12 quarters of profits</strong>, which leaves them with <strong>60% profitable </strong>quarters. While that’s not terrible, it’s not the most financially secure either.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>, which puts them at <strong>75% profitability</strong>. And here’s the kicker—<strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the past five years</strong>.</p>\n<p>That financial stability means continued improvements for both agents and clients, with no surprises or cost-cutting moves that hurt your bottom line. If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cf7f04b909c13ff1-Commission-Splits-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>When it comes to commission splits, this is where agents often pay the most attention. After all, it’s what determines how much of your hard-earned money stays in your pocket.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Corcoran</strong>, agents face some of the lowest commission splits in the industry, with splits ranging from <strong>50/50</strong> &#8211; <strong>70/30</strong>. For those unfamiliar with splits, this means you could be giving half of your commission back to the brokerage, depending on the deal you negotiate. It ties with Douglas Elliman for one of the lowest splits out there.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> offers one of the most agent-friendly commission structures in the industry. All agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage for the year, you cap and move to <strong>100% commission</strong>—meaning everything after that is yours to keep.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp rewards agents with stock for hitting certain milestones, and if you meet even more goals, you can get your <strong>$16,000 cap</strong> <strong>back</strong> in company stock. Bottom line, eXp Agents can earn more than 100% of their commission and it’s transparent and the same for every agent, no matter their location or experience.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about E&#038;O insurance, which is critical for protecting both you and your brokerage from legal claims. At <strong>Corcoran</strong>, it’s tough to get specifics on E&#038;O insurance. Agents have described it as <strong>“high,”</strong> so it’s worth checking with your local office to find out what you’ll be expected to pay.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> makes <strong>E&#038;O insurance</strong> easy and affordable. You pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but only when you close a deal. And once you hit <strong>$750</strong> for the year, <strong>you’re capped</strong> and done paying for E&#038;O. That’s a huge relief for agents, especially if you’re just starting out and don’t want to deal with big upfront fees before you’ve even closed your first deal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Fees</h2>\n<p>Next up, let’s dive into <strong>fees</strong>, because no one wants to be surprised by extra costs that eat into their earnings. At <strong>Corcoran</strong>, <strong>monthly fees vary</strong> significantly by office, and agents also pay a <strong>6% royalty fee per transaction</strong>. That royalty fee adds up quickly and can really cut into your commission.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong>, on the other hand, keeps things straightforward. Agents pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until they hit their cap. The simplicity and predictability of these fees make eXp Realty a much more cost-effective choice for agents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re a new agent or a seasoned pro, having access to the right <strong>training and support</strong> is critical to your success. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training is top-notch. You get access to <strong>over 50 live training sessions</strong> every week, as well as an <strong>on-demand library</strong> full of helpful resources.</p>\n<p>Plus, new agents can take part in the <strong>Fast Start</strong> program to get up and running quickly, while experienced agents can level up with the <strong>Kick Start</strong> program. And with <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong>, you’ll never be left without help when you need it.</p>\n<p>Over at <strong>Corcoran</strong>, training and support <strong>vary by office</strong>. The level of support you receive depends heavily on your local broker, so if you’re in an office with less training or a less available broker, you may find yourself without the resources you need when it counts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>technology and resources</strong>, staying ahead of the curve can be a game-changer for agents. <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is all about leveraging tech to give agents the best tools.</p>\n<p>As a <strong>fully virtual brokerage</strong>, eXp agents can do everything online, from meeting with their broker to attending training sessions. The <strong>eXp World</strong> platform is like a metaverse for agents, allowing them to collaborate and work together in real time. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>On top of that, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> provides each agent with their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a powerful <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a marketing center filled with customizable templates for social media, flyers, and more.</p>\n<p>Details on <strong>Corcoran’s tech</strong> offerings are a bit more elusive. While they’ve built a solid brand, especially in luxury real estate, there’s no clear information on whether they offer the same kind of comprehensive tech tools that <strong>eXp Realty</strong> does. If cutting-edge technology is a must-have for you, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> seems to be the better bet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-corcoran-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Corcoran May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>Let’s be real—Corcoran does have a lot to offer, especially if you’re an agent who prefers working in an office and enjoys having a nearby person to check up on you and make sure you’re on track.  In that case, your local Corcoran office might feel like home.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, if it’s just that you don’t want to work at home, <strong>eXp Realty does offer FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide. </strong>But, if you’re the type who needs daily interaction and face-to-face accountability to stay on track, eXp’s virtual model might not be the best fit for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t provide. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>When comparing <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> to Corcoran, it’s clear that eXp Realty stands out with its transparent commission splits, lower fees, and unparalleled support and technology. Corcoran is a solid choice for agents who value the branding and prefer a traditional office-based model, but when it comes to overall value and flexibility, eXp Realty has the upper hand.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.
