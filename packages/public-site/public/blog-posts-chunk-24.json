    "content": "<p>This isn’t just another brokerage comparison — it’s a real look at how your paycheck, support, and business tools will be affected by your choice. Whether you&#8217;re drawn to the simplicity of flat fees or the prestige of a well-known name, here&#8217;s how Fathom Realty and Better Homes &#038; Gardens Real Estate compare where it counts.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-better-homes-gardens\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Better Homes &#038; Gardens</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>At Fathom Realty, the 100/0 commission split means what it says — agents keep every cent of their commission. There are no franchise or royalty fees taking a cut, and agents enjoy complete freedom from production caps. The only recurring costs are a flat $700 annual fee and a per-transaction fee between $150 and $250. This predictable, no-frills model has been one of Fathom’s biggest selling points for agents who want to simplify their finances and scale their business without penalty.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens, in contrast, operates under a traditional split model that ranges from 60/40 to 80/20. The company also takes a 6% franchise or royalty fee, which further trims the agent’s net income. There’s no cap in place, so even top producers continue paying the split. Monthly fees vary based on office and region, and while transaction fees are baked into the royalty structure, there are additional costs like E&#038;O insurance. Overall, it’s a higher-cost model, even though it comes with the familiarity of a household brand.</p>\n<p>If your goal is to keep more of what you earn, Fathom&#8217;s lean model clearly gives you more breathing room.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty doesn’t offer revenue share, equity awards, or retirement paths — it’s a commission-only setup. What you close is what you make, and that’s where it ends. It’s clean and simple, but there’s no added value for long-term wealth building.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens follows the same philosophy. Agents earn their commission and have no access to recurring income, revenue sharing, or other wealth-building incentives. So while the company supports sales activity with its branding, it doesn’t reward agents beyond the deals they personally close.</p>\n<p>Neither model offers additional income streams, which may work fine for those focused only on transactions, but won’t meet the needs of agents thinking about scaling or exiting the business someday.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty has earned a reputation for being agent-friendly, but it doesn’t provide structured training or 24/7 support. That approach works well for confident, experienced agents who already know the ropes, but may feel limiting to newer agents seeking mentorship or coaching. The low overhead and minimal intrusion are perks for self-starters, but not ideal for someone who needs handholding.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens does offer training, but it varies by office. Some locations are known for robust support and onboarding, while others offer the bare minimum. Like Fathom, there’s no 24/7 support, so agents are largely dependent on local managers and office culture for help.</p>\n<p>In both models, success depends heavily on your own initiative and your specific office environment.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty gives agents access to basic tech tools like transaction management systems and CRMs. It’s not flashy, but it gets the job done. There’s no massive tech suite, and agents who want advanced lead generation or marketing platforms will need to build that stack independently or join a team that offers it.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens leans into technology and branding more heavily. With the backing of a recognizable brand, agents can access strong marketing resources and CRM systems designed to support high visibility and lead follow-up. These tools can be especially useful for agents who are less tech-savvy or who want to plug into a ready-made system.</p>\n<p>Fathom provides the essentials with freedom to customize. Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers a more fully built platform, but it comes at a higher cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty currently holds a 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor, with hundreds of agents praising the simple commission structure, predictable fees, and freedom to operate independently. Agents regularly mention financial clarity as one of the biggest advantages.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens earns a slightly lower rating of 4.3 stars from fewer total reviews. Agents tend to appreciate the branding, marketing tools, and name recognition, but also mention the pain of ongoing fees and limited income options as recurring downsides.</p>\n<p>If agent reviews are any indicator, the satisfaction difference often comes down to expectations — whether agents prioritize branding or bottom-line income.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-better-homes-gardens\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Better Homes &#038; Gardens</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is the choice for agents who want full commission, fixed fees, and minimal brokerage interference. It’s best suited for those who value autonomy and know how to manage their business without needing constant support or tech-heavy tools.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens makes more sense for agents who want the credibility of a national brand and access to advanced marketing resources. But it comes with the trade-off of lower commission retention and more ongoing costs, with no cap in sight.</p>\n<p>Neither brokerage supports passive income, equity, or long-term wealth strategies. If that’s what you’re looking for, you may want to explore an alternative that gives you both earning power and financial growth opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.<strong></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

This flexibility allows agents to maximize their earnings. There are no franchise or royalty fees, making it more cost-effective for agents who want to keep a higher percentage of their commissions. The production cap at LPT Realty is $15K, meaning agents keep 100% of their commissions after hitting this cap. Monthly fees vary, with options as low as $500/year plus $0 or $89/month, or $149/month, depending on the agent&#8217;s choice. Transaction fees are $195 before reaching the cap.</p>\n<p>In contrast, RE/MAX has commission splits that start at 60/40 and go up to 95/5. However, RE/MAX charges a 5% franchise/royalty fee, which reduces agents&#8217; take-home earnings. The production cap is significantly higher at $23K, and monthly fees range from $300 to $2,500, making RE/MAX a more costly option for agents. Transaction fees are included in the royalty fees, which may provide some predictability, but the higher fees overall can reduce the agent’s bottom line.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out by offering a revenue share program, allowing agents to earn additional income through team building and recruitment. This offers an extra stream of passive income beyond commissions. LPT also provides retirement income and willable income paths, offering agents a long-term financial security option.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX, on the other hand, does not offer a revenue share program, nor does it provide retirement or willable income paths. Agents at RE/MAX rely solely on their commission-based income, which may limit long-term financial planning options.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not have a specified formal training program but offers 24/7 agent support, ensuring that agents have access to help when needed. This level of support is crucial for agents who prefer having consistent access to resources and guidance.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX provides access to its Online University for training, which is a structured learning platform. However, it lacks 24/7 support, which may be a downside for agents who need more immediate assistance, particularly in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides agents with access to a variety of technology tools and platforms designed to enhance their marketing and client management efforts. The cloud-based model allows for flexibility and efficiency, especially for agents on the go.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX also invests in technology, offering agents tools for lead management, marketing, and transaction handling. However, the higher cost structure may make these tools less attractive compared to LPT Realty’s more affordable options.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a 4.3-star rating on Glassdoor, with 37 reviews. Agents appreciate the flexibility in commission splits, lower fees, and income opportunities through the revenue share model.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX holds a 4.2-star rating from 3.3K reviews. While the brand recognition and vast network are major benefits, agents often mention the high fees as a downside.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-re-max\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs REMAX</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers more flexibility with commission splits, lower fees, and additional income streams through its revenue share program, retirement income path, and willable income options. This makes it a great choice for agents who want to maximize their income potential while keeping their costs low.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX, on the other hand, is a well-established brand with strong name recognition and a large network, but its higher fees and lack of additional income opportunities may make it less attractive for agents focused on long-term financial growth.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"/blog/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

Agents benefit from a $15K production cap, after which they retain 100% of their commission. LPT Realty’s monthly fees are flexible, starting at $0 and going up to $149, depending on the agent’s package. Transaction fees are set at $195 before the cap, making it a cost-efficient option for agents looking to maximize earnings.</p>\n<p>Compass, in contrast, has commission splits that range from 60/40 to 92.5/7.5, however, Compassagents only sometimes have a production cap, meaning agents continue to split commissions indefinitely. Monthly fees start at $145 and can vary depending on the office, and transaction fees may go up to 4%, making it a more costly option.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a revenue share model, allowing agents to generate passive income by recruiting others to the brokerage. This program creates additional long-term income opportunities for agents. LPT Realty also offers a retirement income path and willable income, ensuring agents can plan for their financial future beyond commissions.</p>\n<p>Compass does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income, or willable income paths. Agents at Compass are limited to commission-based income, which can restrict long-term financial growth and wealth-building potential.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides agents with solid training resources and 24/7 agent support, ensuring agents have the tools they need to succeed at any time. The availability of support round-the-clock is a key advantage for agents who need immediate assistance.</p>\n<p>Compass has a more traditional training approach through the Compass Academy, offering good resources but without 24/7 agent support. This can be a downside for agents who require ongoing support, especially during non-standard working hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides advanced technology platforms that support CRM, marketing, and transaction management, giving agents the flexibility and efficiency needed to thrive in modern real estate.

While it is highly regarded, the higher costs associated with accessing these tools may deter some agents from looking for a more affordable option.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 37 reviews, with agents praising the revenue share program and lower fees. The smaller number of reviews reflects LPT Realty’s newer entry into the market, but feedback is generally positive.</p>\n<p>Compass holds a 3.7-star rating from 2.4K reviews.

This article will break down the key differences in commission splits, fees, training, technology, and overall agent satisfaction to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-broker-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Compass</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> offers highly competitive commission splits ranging from 85/15 to 100/0, with no franchise or royalty fees, making it a top choice for agents wanting to maximize their earnings. Real Broker also has a production cap of $12K, meaning that agents keep 100% of their commissions once they hit this cap. The brokerage also rewards top agents with a $24K bonus, making it appealing for high producers. Monthly fees are $750 per year, with no transaction fees until agents reach the cap.</p>\n<p><strong>Compass</strong>, on the other hand, offers commission splits from 60/40 to 92.5/7.5, but agents must pay a 4% marketing fee, which can make a significant cut into their overall earnings. Additionally, Compass only sometimes offers a production cap or top agent bonuses, which can be a drawback for high-earning agents. Monthly fees vary by office but typically start at $145.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>One of the standout features of <strong>Real Broker</strong> is its revenue share model, which allows agents to earn income by recruiting other agents. This provides an additional income stream that goes beyond commissions. Real Broker also offers retirement income and willable income paths for agents who meet the time qualifications, giving them long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>Compass</strong> does not offer a revenue share program or additional income opportunities like retirement income or willable income. Agents at Compass are primarily dependent on their commission earnings, which may limit long-term wealth-building potential.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker excels in providing consistent, high-quality training. Agents have access to 30+ live training sessions each week, covering everything from lead generation to transaction management. Additionally, Real offers 24/7 agent support, ensuring that agents can get help whenever they need it.</p>\n<p><strong>Compass</strong> provides training through its Compass Academy, which is widely recognized for its quality. However, unlike Real Broker, Compass does not offer 24/7 support, which could be a limitation for agents working in fast-paced markets or requiring immediate assistance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Both brokerages offer cutting-edge technology to help agents succeed. <strong>Real Broker</strong> uses cloud-based systems that integrate CRM tools, marketing platforms, and transaction management, making it highly efficient for tech-savvy agents. <strong>Compass</strong>, on the other hand, is known for its proprietary technology platform, which includes marketing, listing tools, and data-driven insights to help agents stand out. However, Compass’s tech offerings come at a higher cost, which could impact an agent’s profitability.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> has an impressive Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews. Agents at Real frequently praise the transparent fee structure, income opportunities, and the level of training and support offered.</p>\n<p><strong>Compass</strong> holds a 3.7-star rating from 2.4K reviews on Glassdoor. While Compass agents appreciate the brand’s marketing power and tech tools, complaints often arise around the high fees and limited income opportunities beyond commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-broker-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Compass</h3>\n<p>For agents looking for a brokerage with lower fees, more income streams, and robust support, <strong>Real Broker</strong> is the clear winner. The revenue share model, bonus opportunities, and comprehensive training make it a solid choice for agents who want to grow their careers while maximizing their earnings.</p>\n<p>Compass offers a well-known brand and excellent technology, but higher fees and fewer income opportunities might make it less attractive for agents focused on long-term wealth-building.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"/blog/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

They’ll be looking for <strong>warmth, responsiveness, and professionalism</strong>.  Be conscious of your tone and approach. Show that you’re listening actively, that you’re invested in understanding their needs, and that you’re approachable.</p>\n<p>Ok, let’s get into realtor questions you should be prepared to answer during your buyer agent interview with a home buyer.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-background\">Agent Background</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/adf91edc5877543f-Agent-Background.webp/public\" alt=\"realtor questions on Agent Background\" class=\"wp-image-246864\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agent-Background.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agent-Background-300x71.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agent-Background-768x180.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>Expect homebuyers to quiz you about your roots. How long have you been around the area? How well do you know the local quirks? If you’ve raised a family locally – yes, drop that into your conversation because families often discover hidden gems that others never looked for. Your deep local knowledge is a massive plus, so don’t hold back sharing it!</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Amp up your connection to the community. Talk up your knowledge of the local hotspots, weather patterns, and even those tricky traffic patterns. These insights directly affect your client’s happiness in a new location. Your local expertise is a significant part of your value proposition—don’t be shy about sharing it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"education-experience-and-professional-background\">Education, Experience &#038; Professional Background</h2>\n<p>Be ready for questions about your educational journey, agent experience, and professional affiliations. Where’d you study? How long have you been an agent? Are you a full-time agent? What qualifications do you hold? While some might seem off-topic, they show your commitment to learning and professional growth. Everyone wants a “smart” agent.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Chat about or show your education, ongoing training, and any certifications. The more you show dedication to staying informed and skilled, the more trust you&#8217;ll build with potential clients. Real estate’s always evolving, and clients love an agent who keeps up!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"saving-dough-for-homebuyers\">Saving Dough for Homebuyers</h2>\n<p>One of the most impactful realtor question you’ll face is: How much money can you save me? Clients are becoming more aware that a savvy buyer agent can save them significant sums, sometimes even more than your fees.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Come prepared with data. If you’ve consistently saved your clients money, share those stats proudly. While you can’t guarantee future savings, having a track record speaks volumes about your negotiation skills and real estate market savvy. This is where you demonstrate that hiring you is an investment that pays for itself.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"steller-reviews\">Steller Reviews</h2>\n<p>Even if they don’t ask outright, be the first to mention your reviews. What have past clients said about you?</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Point them to your Google Business Profile or Zillow where your reviews live. Proud of a solid five-star streak? Shout it out! Good reviews not only reflect your ability to deliver but also show you care about your reputation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"winning-in-multiple-offers\">Winning in Multiple Offers</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6c7423eb95eb1773-Winning-in-Multiple-Offers.webp/public\" alt=\"Winning in Multiple Offers\" class=\"wp-image-246867\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Winning-in-Multiple-Offers.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Winning-in-Multiple-Offers-300x75.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Winning-in-Multiple-Offers-768x191.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>In a hot market, your clients will want to know your success rate in multiple-offer scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Share your stats. High success rates here can really set you apart as a skilled competitor. While no agent can win every time, being able to show a strong track record of success will instill confidence in your potential clients.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"advising-against-risky-purchases\">Advising Against Risky Purchases</h2>\n<p>Homebuyers often get excited when they find great homes, sometimes overlooking potential pitfalls. They’ll value a buyer agent who’s not afraid to flag risks. In fact, many surveys have stated that this is the biggest value people perceive that buyer agents bring to the table.  So, if they don’t ask, bring up your record.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>If possible, whip out a spreadsheet of stats to verify how many times you’ve steered a buyer away from a potential bad or risky deal.  Concrete examples go a long way.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-value\">Brokerage Value</h2>\n<p>While your personal value as a real estate agent is paramount, the strength of your brokerage is another area of interest. Homebuyers want to know that they’re backed by the best.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Be prepared to discuss what makes your brokerage stand out. If you’re with eXp Realty, for example, highlight the brokerage’s leadership in helping more families than any other brokerage in the United States and also your access to exclusive off-market properties.</p>\n<p>Explain how being part of a leading brokerage benefits them from tools and resources to reputation and network leverage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees-and-discounts\">Fees and Discounts</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/bbda9fa9b457cac7-Fees-and-Discounts.webp/public\" alt=\"realtor questions on Fees and Discounts\" class=\"wp-image-246865\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fees-and-Discounts.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fees-and-Discounts-300x76.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fees-and-Discounts-768x194.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>Expect that homebuyers will be curious about your fees and if there’s room to negotiate. It’s a fair realtor question, as they’re trying to get the most bang for their buck. But start by explaining how discount fees generally mean less than full service.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Be transparent and consistent about your fees and any discounts you offer.  Even if you don’t do discounts, explain how you work to get them the best deal on their home. That saves them money too! Also, if your clients have benefited from some fee commission reduction like perhaps you buy all your clients a home warranty, highlight that.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"service-fee-menus\">Service Fee Menus</h2>\n<p>Along with discussing your fees with clients, consider offering fee menus.  For example, consider charging one fee for full service and a lower fee for limited service.  Doing that alone will help your potential clients understand the difference between the two and they’ll love having a choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Tailoring options to their needs shows you’re focused on providing value, not just making a sale.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-real-deal-on-commissions\">The Real Deal on Commissions</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"231\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5dca3c0713c03d07-The-Real-Deal-on-Commissions.webp/public\" alt=\"realtor questions on The Real Deal on Commissions\" class=\"wp-image-246866\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/The-Real-Deal-on-Commissions.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/The-Real-Deal-on-Commissions-300x69.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/The-Real-Deal-on-Commissions-768x177.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>And, again, on the topic of agent fees, do NOT miss the opportunity to explain what your actual take-home pay is for your earned fee.  It’s common for buyers to think agents pocket the full commission. This is your chance to set the record straight!</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Break down your real costs—how much goes to the brokerage, team, expenses, etc. This transparency helps them more deeply appreciate your services and understand the value they’re getting. Don’t forget to recap that you don’t get paid at all unless you find them their dream home and secure it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wrapping-it-up\">Wrapping it Up</h2>\n<p>Armed with this knowledge, you’re set to impress and win clients.

Here’s how:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fee-transparency\">Fee Transparency</h3>\n<p>Now that buyer agents must have written<a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts/written-buyer-agreements-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> buyer agreements</a> in the form of a <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts/homebuyers-what-the-nar-settlement-means\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home buyer</a> representation agreement that lays out their fees, real estate buyer agent fees will be clear. With agents needing this agreement before showing a home, home buyers will have upfront knowledge about the fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"negotiation-power\">Negotiation Power</h3>\n<p>Instead of the fee being set by the home seller and offered to any agent through the MLS, buyers now can negotiate directly with their agent based on the value that their agent will provide.</p>\n<p>These changes are steps in the right direction, ensuring the process is more transparent and fair.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"misconceptions-about-buyer-agents\">Misconceptions About Buyer Agents</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3a15b66d24870010-Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents.webp/public\" alt=\"Misconceptions About Buyer Agents\" class=\"wp-image-246783\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents-300x78.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents-768x199.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>These new rules come at a time when many home buyers and sellers are undervaluing the role of buyer agents. They’re getting excited about the <strong>possibility of lower fees</strong>. After all, with home searches just a click away, it’s easy for them to think, “<strong>I’m doing all the work</strong> finding the home; the agent just opens the door and takes a big cut!”</p>\n<p>I understand where they’re coming from. Before becoming an agent, I thought the same way. And now that I’m in the business, I know that some agents really don’t bring enough value to justify their fees, so sometimes I was right in my assumptions.</p>\n<p>But here’s the reality: <strong>the old system didn’t help</strong>. Whether an agent was exceptional or just average, they got paid the same from the seller. But now, with these new NAR changes, buyer agents have to communicate the value they bring and justify their costs. The field just got a lot tougher, and that’s a good thing—fewer mediocre agents, more value for buyers!</p>\n<p>Before becoming an agent, part of the reason I undervalued buyer agents was because I didn’t realize a few key things: that Buyer Agents Work on Contingency; that the “big number” on the closing statement and on their TV screens when they watch Million Dollar Listing isn’t the agent’s take-home pay; or that Buyer agents handle about 100 tasks for their clients behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>These are all things you buyer agents out there now need to explain to home buyers. They really don’t know. Need some help with that? Check out our blog and videos about real estate buyer agent consultations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyers-avoiding-buyer-agents\">Buyers Avoiding Buyer Agents</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"217\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cd5bcf37345a1161-Buyers-Avoiding-Buyer-Agents.webp/public\" alt=\"Buyers Avoiding Buyer Agents\" class=\"wp-image-246781\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyers-Avoiding-Buyer-Agents.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyers-Avoiding-Buyer-Agents-300x65.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyers-Avoiding-Buyer-Agents-768x167.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>So, in my neck of the woods, and perhaps yours too, you may have heard that while these new NAR changes are a big win for home buyers, they’re also having an <strong>unintended consequence.</strong> More buyers are now approaching listing agents directly, skipping buyer agents altogether.</p>\n<p>These buyers likely don’t realize what they’re missing out on. A good buyer agent can save them money, reduce their risk, and give them a much better chance of landing their dream home, especially in a competitive market.</p>\n<p>And here’s the kicker—many of these <strong>DIY buyers think they’re saving money</strong>, but if things are playing out where you are the same way they are for me, listing agents are adding a fee in their contract with the seller to compensate them for doing some legwork that buyer agents would typically handle.</p>\n<p>Well, that’s fair, but DIY home buyers don’t realize that they aren’t saving what they think they are.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"history-of-buyer-agency\">History of Buyer Agency</h2>\n<p>So, how did we get here? With all the recent lawsuits, you likely know that real estate agent fees have hovered around <strong>5% or 6% for a long time</strong>. How long? Since the <strong>1940s</strong>.</p>\n<p>But there was a big difference back then. Back in the day, the full 5% or 6% went to the listing agent. That&#8217;s right—the listing agent pocketed the whole commission because there were no buyer agents.</p>\n<p>By the <strong>1960s</strong>, listing agents realized they could sell more homes by offering a portion of their commission to other agents who would bring in lots of potential buyers. These agents, known as sub-agents, worked under the listing agent’s wing, splitting the commission in exchange for helping to market and sell the home.</p>\n<p>Less money for the listing agent, sure, but also less work because the sub-agents handled a lot of the tasks. The trade-off made sense for listing agents.</p>\n<p>This arrangement worked for a while, but it came with a major flaw. The sub-agents, while helping buyers, were actually representing the seller’s interests, not the buyers’. Even if a sub-agent never met the seller, their legal responsibility was to the seller.</p>\n<p>This meant that buyers were often under the false impression that the agent showing them homes was working in their best interest when, in reality, they weren’t.</p>\n<p>In fact, a <strong>1983 FTC study</strong> revealed that 72% of buyers were under the false impression that the agents showing them homes were representing them.</p>\n<p>By the early <strong>1990s</strong>, this system started to crack under pressure. More and more buyers, realizing they had been left out in the cold without proper representation, began filing lawsuits.</p>\n<p>In response to these lawsuits, the real estate industry came up with a solution—buyer agency. This new model allowed buyer agents to have a fiduciary duty to the buyer, meaning they could truly represent the buyer’s best interests. And, listing agents continued to split their commission with these hardworking buyer agents who helped them sell the house.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-sellers-will-continue-to-pay-buyer-agents\">Why Sellers Will Continue to Pay Buyer Agents</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/500285e5f4bac065-Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents.webp/public\" alt=\"Why Sellers Will Continue to Pay Buyer Agents\" class=\"wp-image-246785\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents-768x151.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>With these new NAR changes, life has become a bit easier for home sellers too. Now, sellers sign listing agreements where they’re only obligated to pay their own agent&#8217;s fees. This makes sense, right?</p>\n<p>But sellers can still agree, through negotiation with a home buyer, to cover the buyer agent’s fees too. The big question is, will they? I believe the answer is, of course they will! And here’s why:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Attracting Buyer Agents: Buyer agency started because home buyers needed real representation, but it also benefited sellers by attracting more buyers. That fundamental reason hasn’t changed.</li>\n<li>Maximizing Buyers&#8217; Budgets: When buyers put down larger down payments, they often qualify for lower interest rates, which saves them money and enables them to afford a more expensive home. Sellers want buyers to have more purchasing power, right?</li>\n<li>Tax Benefits: If sellers pay the buyer agent’s fees, it lowers their profit on paper, which can positively affect their taxes. So, there’s a financial incentive for sellers to consider covering those costs.</li>\n<li>Focus on Net Profit: At the day’s end, sellers only care about their net profit. It doesn’t matter whether they pay the buyer agent’s fee or not—it’s all about how much they walk away with after the sale.</li>\n<li>All this debate about whether sellers will pay is overblown. Even those who claim they’ll never pay a buyer agent’s fee will change their tune when they see they can net more money from the sale by doing so.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-the-new-rules-lead-to-lower-prices\">Will the New Rules Lead to Lower Prices?</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"204\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/fb25394980fff8e2-Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices.webp/public\" alt=\"Will the New NAR Changes Lead to Lower Prices\" class=\"wp-image-246786\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices-300x61.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices-768x157.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>First off, they’ve already gone down. Th president of the National Association of Realtors said, the “Average commission in the U.S. fell to a new low of 4.94% in 2020.” So, fees already dropped since online searches became the norm after 2008.</p>\n<p>Will fees drop even more? My guess—not by much.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"impact-for-listing-agents\">Impact for Listing Agents</h3>\n<p>For listing agents, nothing has changed, except they can pick up a higher pay by charging the seller for unrepresented buyers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"full-service-buyer-agents-fees\">Full-Service Buyer Agents’ Fees</h3>\n<p>As for full-service buyer agents, we’ll probably keep charging 2.5-3% because, on average, we spend twice as much time per client as listing agents do. If we aren’t paid enough, it just doesn’t make sense for us to stay in the game.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"discount-agents\">Discount Agents</h3>\n<p>Buyers who want to save a buck can always go for discount agents, but you should let them know they’re likely sacrificing service quality. Evidence of that? Discount agents have been around for over a decade, and they haven’t taken over the industry. “Discount” is code for less service.</p>\n<p>However, the rise of unrepresented buyers might lower overall fees slightly, but not by 2.5-3%. Those unrepresented buyers will once again, just like back in the days when the listing agent made the whole 5 – 6%, be paying for the listing agent to cover some of the work a buyer agent would normally do.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if we soon see a wave of lawsuits from unrepresented buyers who didn’t fully understand the “cost” of going it alone or the risks of being taken advantage of. Sounds a lot like the 1990s all over again.</p>\n<p>So, while I don’t foresee a significant drop in agent fees, these changes are a huge win for home buyers. They now have a clearer understanding of what they’re paying for, and buyer agents need to step up and clearly explain the value they bring to the table.</p>\n<p>Agents who can’t or won’t do that will likely find themselves out of the business, which is ultimately great for the reputation of the real estate profession. So hang in there, communicate your value, and get ready for your greatest success ever.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>The recent NAR changes have increased transparency in real estate agent fees, requiring written agreements and giving buyers more negotiation power.</p>\n<p>While this could lead to misconceptions about the value of buyer agents, it also pushes agents to better communicate their worth.</p>\n<p>Despite some buyers attempting to bypass agents, the changes are unlikely to lead to a significant drop in overall fees. Ultimately, the new rules benefit both buyers and the industry by encouraging higher standards among real estate professionals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>By partnering with us, you’ll be joining the <a href=\"/exp-realty-sponsor/\">ONLY profitable public brokerage in the past 5 years</a> that agents rank as the <a href=\"/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>With Smart Agent Alliance</strong> you’ll enjoy personalized day-to-day concierge care plus assets like customizable agent presentations, business automation, production checklists, customizable social media posts, and <a href=\"/exp-realty-sponsor/\">so much more.</a></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d64578f59bcb5588-Resize-3.webp/public\" alt=\"Group photo of Wolf Pack team members at eXp CON\" class=\"wp-image-3493\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3.webp 960w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-768x432.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"></figure>\n<p>As a member of our team, you’ll also enjoy exclusive access to the <strong>Wolf Pack weekly webinars</strong>, <strong>Social Agent Academy</strong> for social media training, the <strong>Wolf Pack Hub</strong> for easy onboarding, Investor Army for investing and flipping houses training, and more.</p>\n<p>Don’t miss out on this amazing opportunity to maximize your earnings and build a thriving real estate business. <a href=\"/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Join eXp Realty today</a> and <strong>experience unparalleled support</strong> from our FREE team.</p>\n<p>Not quite convinced?

With agents needing this agreement before showing a home, home buyers will have upfront knowledge about the fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-home-buyers-negotiate-for-a-lower-real-estate-buyer-agent-commission\">Can home buyers negotiate for a lower real estate buyer agent commission?</h3>\n<p>Yes, instead of the fee being set by the home seller and offered to any agent through the MLS, buyers now can negotiate directly with their agent based on the value that their agent will provide.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-real-estate-buyer-agents-accept-lower-fees\">Will real estate buyer agents accept lower fees?</h3>\n<p>We think the answer is yes for brand-new agents who do not yet have a strong value proposition and no for seasoned agents who know what value they bring to the table.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-home-buyers-buy-a-home-without-a-real-estate-buyer-agent\">Can home buyers buy a home without a real estate buyer agent?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but there is still likely a hidden fee for being unrepresented as the listing agent needs to perform more work. Plus, home buyers without an agent miss out on buyer agent perks like saving home buyers money, reducing their risk, and giving them a much better chance of landing their dream home, especially in a competitive market.ng what they think they are.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-the-new-rules-lead-to-lower-prices-2\">Will the New Rules Lead to Lower Prices?</h3>\n<p>Probably not much. Total average fees will be lower due to home buyers taking on the extra risk of buying a home without an agent and maybe also from brand new agents giving discounts until they know their worth. But, it’s not likely full-service agents will drop their fees.</p>\n<p>Home buyers can also choose discount agents, but they always could. Discounters haven’t taken over the market because discount means less service and generally less optimal outcomes too.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-should-real-estate-buyer-agents-do-to-survive\">What should real estate buyer agents do to survive?</h3>\n<p>Easy, <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/sales-marketing/agents-lean-in-on-value-and-their-clients-see-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agents Lean in on Value—and Their Clients See It</a>.

Why? They&#8217;ve caught wind that they don&#8217;t need a buyer agent to check out a house.</p>\n<p>So, what happens when these eager buyers hit up listing agents to open doors for them? Well, the cool listing agents are staying in their lane and saying, “Nope, I don’t cover buyer agent duties. Go find one.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>But some listing agents, where it’s legal, are scooping up these buyers with <strong>dual agency</strong> representation – you know that type of representation that really results in no representation but costs the same as a buyer agent. And, other listing agents are encouraging buyers to sign a simple <strong>unrepresented buyer agreement</strong> just so the buyers can take a peek inside the house.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/dc913f4aa9ef60b1-Buyer-Agent-Problem-1-Listing-Agent-Contact-Advantage.webp/public\" alt=\"real estate buyer agent problems are unbalanced now, displayed through a close-up of a balance\" class=\"wp-image-246491 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-1-Listing-Agent-Contact-Advantage.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-1-Listing-Agent-Contact-Advantage-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Think buyers will quickly sign these agreements without thinking much about it?  Yes, of course, they will. They want into the house and signing seems like no biggie! Except it is.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why. Many listing agents charge their sellers an extra fee to handle unrepresented buyers – they aren’t going to do buyer agent work for free.</p>\n<p>If a buyer signs an unrepresented buyer agreement, then sees the light and hires a buyer agent to work the deal, depending on the listing agreement, that buyer might get slapped with both unrepresented buyer fees and buyer agent fees. Talk about a financial mess for buyers!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-can-you-do\">What can you do?</h3>\n<p><strong>Make some noise</strong> about this. Tell everyone that these unrepresented buyers are still coughing up cash through hidden fees tucked away in contracts they can’t see. They’re not saving what they think and they’re giving up a lot of buyer agent advantages.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-2-listing-agent-open-house-edge\">Buyer Agent Problem #2: Listing Agent Open House Edge</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, direct phone calls from home buyers to listing agents are not the only way listing agents get the upper hand with the new NAR changes. Their open houses pull in loads of potential buyers too.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s another trap for buyers.</strong> Unscrupulous or naïve open house agents (who are not always the listing agents) may lead visitors into thinking they need to sign a representation agreement right then and there to tour the place.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/8536d80056362e08-Buyer-Agent-Problem-2-Listing-Agent-Open-House-Edge.webp/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246486 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-2-Listing-Agent-Open-House-Edge.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-2-Listing-Agent-Open-House-Edge-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Not true! Since the new rules don&#8217;t apply to seller agents (or any agent sitting at an open house), no one needs to sign anything to stroll through an open house.</p>\n<p>But if a house hunter wants the lowdown on some insider info about the property, an open house agent might say, &#8220;Sorry, can’t share that unless you sign up with me.&#8221;  Good for home buyers? <strong>No way!</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Home buyers should take the time to find the best agent to represent them. Signing on the spot doesn’t do that.  But will people sign? Of course, they will because that’s the quickest way to get answers to their burning property questions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it\">How to handle it?</h3>\n<p>Spread the word loud and clear: signing on the fly is risky business. Urge potential buyers to take their time to really get what value an agent brings before they sign anything.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-3-zillow-and-similar-lead-providers\">Buyer Agent Problem #3: Zillow &#038; Similar Lead Providers</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Now onto Zillow, which due to the NAR changes, has started requiring callers interested in a property to sign a <strong>7-day non-exclusive touring agreement</strong>. Potential buyers might shrug and sign, thinking, “It’s just a week.”</p>\n<p>But here’s the twist: if they fall for the property and need to act fast, they&#8217;re stuck with that agent to make the quick offer.

After all, you have already taught them so much!</p>\n<p>In California, the maximum term for a buyer representation agreement is three months. Kudos to you agents for getting clients into contracts in three months, but let’s be real—it often doesn’t happen that fast.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>We’re not fans of this new time cap, even though we let buyers cancel contracts anytime. Why? It’s tough when I’m pouring value into a client’s lap for them to face me and cancel our agreement. But if a contract just runs out of time, it’s easier for people to just do nothing and decide to go it alone. In that case, they don’t even need to talk to me.</p>\n<p>This leaves us in a <strong>bit of a bind</strong>: spill too much wisdom and you might just convince clients they can handle it solo; hold back, and they might think you’re not worth keeping around.</p>\n<p>Of course, we agents know unrepresented buyers are significantly disadvantaged by not working with a buyer agent and, worse, by getting played by savvy listing agents. However, buyers don’t seem to understand the disadvantages of having no representation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-2\">How to handle it? </h3>\n<p>Navigating this tightrope of upfront value, well that’s tricky. Honestly, I don’t think there’s any magic fix. Buckle up, it’s gonna be a wild ride.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-6-signed-unrepresented-buyer-agreement\">Buyer Agent Problem #6: Signed Unrepresented Buyer Agreement</h2>\n<p>I<strong>magine this:</strong> a buyer comes to you all excited, saying they’ve signed an unrepresented buyer agreement but now they’ve seen the light and want your help to buy the house. Awesome, right? Not so fast.</p>\n<p>If they’ve already signed off with a listing agent, there’s a good chance that the agent will pocket their “extra” unrepresented buyer fee, even if they don’t finish the work. That means your buyer could be on the hook for more fees than they expect.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-3\">How to handle it? </h3>\n<p><strong>Educate, educate, educate</strong> so that buyers don’t get in this pickle to start with. But, if it does happen to you, let your buyer know the problem, and then contact the listing agent to determine the level of the problem.</p>\n<p>Consider requesting that the listing agent amend their listing agreement. Or, you might consider lowering your own compensation if it means securing the best outcome for your client. In that case, hopefully, the listing agent already put in some hours that you would have done had the buyer contacted you originally.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-7-more-record-keeping\">Buyer Agent Problem #7: More Record Keeping</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Oh, the joys of NAR changes and paperwork!

Why? This rigorous paperwork is your best defense against any accusations of violating fair housing laws.</p>\n<p>The best new plan: Keep detailed records and stay consistent with your fees, no matter the client or situation. It’s your safeguard in this tricky business.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-8-getting-paid\">Buyer Agent Problem #8: Getting Paid</h2>\n<p>First off, nail down a buyer representation contract that spells out your fee. And don’t sweat it if a buyer’s worried about affording your fee on their own.</p>\n<p>Most sellers will still see the <strong>value in footing the bill</strong> for buyer agents because it brings more buyers and potentially higher offers. Even stubborn sellers will change their tune when they see a net offer that outshines the rest.</p>\n<p>Second, make sure your offers include <strong>clear language</strong> about the seller covering the buyer agent fee. Something like, “Seller agrees to pay the buyer $x amount to meet buyer’s obligation to pay buyer agent”. </p>\n<p>Make sure you get this right for your state’s procedures.  Get it wrong and you may not get paid!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-9-need-to-warn-do-it-yourselfers\">Buyer Agent Problem #9: Need to Warn Do-It-Yourselfers</h2>\n<p>Here’s a hot take on these NAR changes: lots of buyers think they don’t need a buyer agent anymore—either because they believe agents <strong>just open doors</strong>, or they think they can’t afford one.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0b2eeb9e92ff0470-Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers.webp/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246490 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>It’s on you to set the record straight.

Remember those sneaky unrepresented buyer fees we talked about? That’s just the <strong>tip of the iceberg</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Let’s say there are two identical offers on a house—one with a buyer agent, and one without. Guess which one has the edge? Yep, the one with the agent. Why?

Buyers are signing because they want to get into the house. Buyers don’t know there is likely a cost to having no representation. That fee, negotiated between the listing agent and the seller, is hidden and it may be substantial. Buyers will often have worse outcomes, pay more and take on more risk, without a good buyer agent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-home-buyers-need-to-sign-agreements-to-see-an-open-house\">Do home buyers need to sign agreements to see an open house?</h3>\n<p>No, but open houses do give listing agents an edge to get naive home buyers to sign agreements like dual agency (where allowed), unrepresented buyer, or a single property buyer (when the open house agent is not the listing agent). Home buyers need to interview agents to find the best one. They should never sign a contract on the fly as there may be hidden fees and it’s not in their best interest. Open house visitors can see the home without signing any agreement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if-a-buyer-requests-a-home-showing-through-zillow-must-they-sign-a-buyer-representation-agreement\">If a buyer requests a home showing through Zillow must they sign a buyer representation agreement?</h3>\n<p>Yes, in the form of a 7-day touring agreement. Problem &#8211; if the buyer wants to immediately make an offer, they are stuck with the randomly assigned agent who is paying Zillow to get these leads. That agent may easily not be the best match to get the best outcome for the buyer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-home-sellers-keep-paying-for-buyer-agents\">Will home sellers keep paying for buyer agents?</h3>\n<p>Yes, most likely. In the end, sellers just want the highest net price for their home. It’s simple math.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if-a-home-buyer-signs-an-unrepresented-buyer-agreement-can-they-still-hire-a-buyer-agent\">If a home buyer signs an unrepresented buyer agreement, can they still hire a buyer agent?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but it may be costly because there is usually a hidden fee associated with these unrepresented buyer agreements and that fee may or may not end when the buyer decides they want their own buyer representation. Buyers can ask their agent to get the low down and work the issue with the listing agent for a potentially better client outcome.</p>\n",

can significantly influence a real estate agent’s career path, financial gains, and overall satisfaction. In this analysis, we’ll dive into the key differences between <strong>Real vs Fathom Realty</strong>, two leading players in the real estate industry. We’ll examine their foundational elements, financial performance, commission splits, income opportunities, training, and support systems, along with additional features that each offers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#overview\">Overview</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#financial-strength\">Financial Strength</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#additional-features\">Additional Features</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-fathom-realty\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Fathom Realty</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Real</strong> was founded in 2014 and has quickly become a notable contender in the real estate brokerage industry with its innovative approach and cloud-based model. The brokerage boasts over 20,000 agents across 50 states, indicating a significant presence in the U.S. real estate market. Real&#8217;s Glassdoor rating stands at 4.5 from 109 reviews, highlighting strong agent satisfaction and a positive work environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, established in 2010, has developed a strong foundation with operations in 41 states and a network of over 11,000 agents. It enjoys a slightly higher Glassdoor rating of 4.6 from 425 reviews, reflecting a strong reputation for agent satisfaction and a supportive company culture.</p>\n<p>Both Real and Fathom Realty have carved out unique niches within the real estate sector, with Real focusing on rapid growth and technological solutions, while Fathom Realty emphasizes its extensive reach and agent-centric policies.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"financial-strength\">Financial Strength</h2>\n<p>When evaluating financial strength in <strong>Real vs Fathom Realty</strong>, there is a distinct contrast between the two. Real, listed under the ticker REAL, trades around $6 and has had only 1 profitable quarter out of 19. This suggests challenges in achieving consistent profitability, which might raise concerns for agents seeking stable, long-term financial growth.</p>\n<p>Fathom Realty, on the other hand, is publicly listed under the ticker FATH, trading around $2. Similar to Real, Fathom has also experienced only 1 profitable quarter, indicating financial hurdles in maintaining steady profitability.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages face financial challenges, but Fathom Realty has a more transparent track record due to its longer tenure in the industry. In contrast, Real&#8217;s position as a newer player might imply potential for growth, albeit with some financial instability.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>Commission splits and associated fees are pivotal factors in deciding between brokerages. <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> offers a 100/0 commission split, which is appealing to agents seeking to maximize their earnings without sharing a portion with the brokerage. This structure, however, comes without any top agent bonuses. Fathom Realty operates with a production cap of $0, which is advantageous for agents who wish to retain most of their commission earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>Real</strong>, meanwhile, provides an 85/15 to 100/0 commission split, allowing agents to start with a modest commission share and gradually earn more as they cap. Real’s production cap is set at $12K, which could be appealing for agents who can quickly reach this cap and enjoy higher commission retention. Additionally, Real offers a $24K elite agent bonus, serving as an incentive for high-performing agents to maximize their income potential.</p>\n<p>When comparing commission splits in Real vs Fathom Realty, Fathom’s 100/0 split offers agents the maximum possible commission retention, but lacks additional bonuses. Real’s flexible split structure, combined with bonus opportunities, might attract agents looking for a balanced approach between initial commission sharing and eventual high earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>Beyond traditional commissions, income opportunities can significantly impact an agent’s earnings. <strong>Real</strong> provides multiple avenues for supplementary income, including revenue sharing and stock awards. Agents can earn 150 shares upon annual capping and have the option to purchase discounted stock with a 5% pre-cap bonus and a 20% post-cap bonus. These features offer substantial financial growth potential, especially for agents interested in building wealth through stock ownership.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> does not provide revenue share income or stock awards, focusing solely on commission earnings. This lack of additional income streams might limit financial opportunities for agents who prefer diversified earning potential beyond commissions.</p>\n<p>The analysis of income opportunities in Real vs Fathom Realty highlights Real’s edge in offering revenue sharing and stock awards, which could be appealing for agents seeking to expand their income sources. Fathom Realty’s straightforward commission structure may suit those who prioritize simplicity over-diversification.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Training and support are vital aspects of any brokerage, significantly influencing an agent’s professional development and success. <strong>Real</strong> offers 30+ live training hours per week, ensuring agents have access to continuous learning and skill enhancement opportunities. However, it does not provide a virtual office environment, which could limit access to collaborative tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, similar to Real, does not offer a virtual office setup or structured live training sessions. While Fathom emphasizes agent satisfaction and community support, its lack of comprehensive training programs might be a drawback for agents accustomed to regular educational offerings.</p>\n<p>In the comparison of training and support between Real vs Fathom Realty, Real edges out slightly with its provision of live training sessions, albeit without a virtual office. Fathom’s higher Glassdoor rating might indicate stronger cultural satisfaction and support, but both brokerages have room for improvement in their training offerings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-features\">Additional Features</h2>\n<p>Additional features such as healthcare options, mentorship programs, and technological tools can significantly enhance an agent’s experience at a brokerage. <strong>Real</strong> offers healthcare options, which can be crucial for agents seeking comprehensive benefits beyond financial compensation. However, it lacks mentorship programs and does not provide a free sponsor value or partner networks to the extent seen in other brokerages.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, in contrast, offers healthcare options but also lacks mentorship programs and additional technological tools. The absence of these features might be a drawback for agents seeking a full-service brokerage with comprehensive support systems.</p>\n<p>In evaluating additional features in Real vs Fathom Realty, both brokerages have specific strengths but also areas where they could enhance their offerings. Real’s healthcare options and stock purchase programs may attract agents looking for added benefits, while Fathom’s established reputation and agent-centric culture could appeal to those seeking community support.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-fathom-realty\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Fathom Realty</h2>\n<p>The choice between <strong><a href=\"https://www.onereal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.fathomrealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fathom Realty</a></strong> hinges on individual agent priorities and career aspirations. <strong>Real</strong> offers a balanced approach with flexible commission splits, revenue sharing, and stock awards, making it attractive to agents seeking diversified income opportunities and growth potential. Its innovative approach and extensive training programs cater to agents who value professional development and financial incentives.

Its established presence and agent-centric culture provide stability and support, which can be appealing for agents prioritizing simplicity and community engagement.</p>\n<p>In weighing the factors of <strong>Real vs Fathom Realty</strong>, agents should consider which brokerage aligns best with their financial goals, support needs, and overall career vision. Both brokerages offer unique advantages, and the decision ultimately rests on whether an agent values diversified income streams and training or prefers a no-commission-sharing approach with a strong community focus.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"/exp-realty-sponsor/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Century 21 vs Coldwell Banker to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-century-21-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Century 21 vs Coldwell Banker</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Century 21 offers agent/broker commission splits ranging from 70/30 to 92/8, with an 8% franchise/royalty fee even after the cap is reached. This means that agents at Century 21 can retain between 70% to 92% of their commissions but must pay an 8% fee on their gross commission income regardless of their production level. In contrast, Coldwell Banker provides splits starting at 55/45 and going up to 90/10, with a franchise/royalty fee ranging from 5% to 6.5%. Therefore, agents at Coldwell Banker can retain between 55% to 90% of their commissions, subject to the franchise fee on their gross commission income.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees also differ significantly between the two brokerages. Century 21&#8217;s monthly fees range from $0 to $350, reflecting differences in local markets and office operating costs. Coldwell Banker has monthly fees ranging from $150 to $179. Additionally, Century 21 includes transaction fees within their royalty fees, simplifying the cost structure for agents, whereas Coldwell Banker includes transaction fees in their royalty fees, which can be more predictable and manageable for agents. Errors &#038; Omissions insurance at Coldwell Banker costs $300 per month, while it is not specified for Century 21. These differences can impact an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning, making it important to consider each brokerage&#8217;s fee structure carefully.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Unfortunately, neither Century 21 nor Coldwell Banker offers revenue share programs, retirement income paths, or willable income paths. This limitation means that agents are primarily reliant on their commission-based earnings. In contrast to some other brokerages that offer multiple streams of income, such as revenue sharing or passive income opportunities, Century 21 and Coldwell Banker focus solely on commission income.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Both Century 21 and Coldwell Banker provide training programs, but the quality and availability of these programs can vary by office. Century 21 offers training that varies by office, which might lead to inconsistencies in the quality of training received. Coldwell Banker also provides training that varies by office, which can be a drawback for agents who prefer a more consistent training experience. Neither brokerage offers 24/7 support, which can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development. The absence of round-the-clock support means that agents might need to rely on local office resources or peer networks for assistance outside of regular business hours. This can be a limitation for agents who need immediate support or who work in markets with extended hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Both Century 21 and Coldwell Banker incorporate technological tools to enhance agent productivity and client engagement. Century 21 offers a range of technology solutions tailored to various market needs, including marketing tools and CRM systems designed to streamline agent workflows. Coldwell Banker also invests in technology, providing agents with tools to manage leads, market properties, and streamline transactions effectively. However, the specific technology offerings can vary by office, reflecting differences in local market needs and office resources. Both brokerages provide valuable technological resources, but the specific tools and platforms offered may appeal differently depending on the agent’s needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Century 21 has a Glassdoor rating of 4.2 stars based on 1.5K reviews, indicating strong agent approval and satisfaction. The positive rating reflects Century 21&#8217;s support for agents and the resources available to them. Coldwell Banker holds a slightly higher rating of 4.3 stars from 2.6K reviews, suggesting relatively higher agent satisfaction. The higher rating for Coldwell Banker may reflect its broader market reach, diverse training opportunities, and support resources. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-century-21-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Century 21 vs Coldwell Banker</h2>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.century21.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Century 21</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coldwellbankerhomes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coldwell Banker</a>, it’s evident that each brokerage has its strengths and weaknesses. Century 21 offers a strong brand, support for various market specialists, and a simplified cost structure with inclusive transaction fees. However, its fixed franchise fee even after the cap may not appeal to all agents, and the variability in training quality can be a drawback.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers a broader market reach, consistent support, and a higher overall agent satisfaction rating. However, the additional transaction fees and monthly fees can impact net income, and the variability in training quality across offices can be a concern. Both brokerages lack supplementary income opportunities such as revenue sharing, which might limit long-term financial growth for agents.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison and to find the best brokerage for your needs, check out our <a href=\"/blog/brokerage-comparison/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.
