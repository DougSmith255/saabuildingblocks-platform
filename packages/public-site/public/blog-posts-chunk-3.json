Every agent gets eXp’s unmatched tech, training, and national community. That’s the baseline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But your primary sponsor, the person you name on your application, can pile on even more: private masterminds, done-for-you marketing tools, and direct access to leaders who actually know your name.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick right, and you’ll plug into a support line that accelerates your production and even does the hard lifting for you to gain a passive income stream. Pick wrong, and you’ll be alone at 2 a.m. Googling “how to get into eXp World.” Oh, and you only get one shot at naming them.

It’s not just a form to fill—it decides which upline you’ll be connected to for support, resources, and mentorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Do-You-Need-a-Sponsor-at-eXp-Realty.png\" alt=\"Do You Need a Sponsor at eXp Realty\" class=\"wp-image-270122 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Do-You-Need-a-Sponsor-at-eXp-Realty.png 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Do-You-Need-a-Sponsor-at-eXp-Realty-300x164.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This isn’t a ceremonial title. Your sponsor is the gatekeeper to <em>extra potential value like </em>exclusive trainings, marketing systems, community, and leadership access that can fast-track your growth. Some sponsors vanish after you sign; others, like Smart Agent Alliance + the Wolf Pack, actually show up. Ours launches you with onboarding help, live masterminds, and training that will move your do-more-deals needle.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-a-good-sponsor-affects-your-income-potential\">How a Good Sponsor Affects Your Income Potential</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong sponsor line can increase both your commission income and passive revenue share earnings. They might hand you proven systems, lead funnels, and attraction tools you’d otherwise have to build, and pay for, yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Smart Agent Alliance agents launch with branded lead-gen landing pages,&nbsp; stay top of mind prospect email drips, and a turnkey agent attraction funnel—day one. That means they’re closing transactions faster and building a passive income stream most agents don’t even consider until year two—right about the time they see their friends cashing revenue share checks and start Googling “how to change your sponsor at eXp” (spoiler: you can’t).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-strong-sponsor-support-leads-to-more-production-and-retention\">How Strong Sponsor Support Leads to More Production and Retention</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line: Agents with engaged sponsors close more deals and stay at eXp longer. Support breeds confidence, confidence breeds production, and production breeds retention.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Inside Smart Agent Alliance + Wolf Pack, agents get weekly top strategies ideas, a supportive community, and direct access to leaders like Mike Sherrard. That’s why this sponsor line has some of the highest retention rates in the company, and why “burnout” isn’t in our vocabulary.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/How-Strong-Sponsor-Support-Leads-to-More-Production-and-Retention.png\" alt=\"How Strong Sponsor Support Leads to More Production and Retention\" class=\"wp-image-270123 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/How-Strong-Sponsor-Support-Leads-to-More-Production-and-Retention.png 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/How-Strong-Sponsor-Support-Leads-to-More-Production-and-Retention-300x164.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-should-new-agents-look-for-in-a-sponsor\">What Should New Agents Look for in a Sponsor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the answer: Choose a sponsor who shows up on day one with proven systems, structured onboarding, and the organization to help you close more deals immediately. They should pour into you for free—no hidden “coaching packages” or upsells later. And make sure they have a plan for passive income support; ignoring that is the #1 regret of current eXp agents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid “promises tomorrow” and pick “proven today.” Pro tip: Ask exactly what you’ll get the moment you join. If the answer is vague, filled with buzzwords, or sounds like they’re stalling for time, keep moving. You don’t need a motivational pen pal; you need a sponsor who delivers results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-e-xp-assign-a-sponsor-if-you-skip-that-field\">Will eXp Assign a Sponsor If You Skip That Field?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: No. While eXp used to assign a random sponsor, the current practice is to leave your upline blank if you don’t name one. That means you’ll have no primary sponsor, and no extra layer of support, without intentionally choosing a sponsor.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Will-eXp-Assign-a-Sponsor-If-You-Skip-That-Field.png\" alt=\"Will eXp Assign a Sponsor If You Skip That Field\" class=\"wp-image-270124 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Will-eXp-Assign-a-Sponsor-If-You-Skip-That-Field.png 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Will-eXp-Assign-a-Sponsor-If-You-Skip-That-Field-300x164.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>On paper, that might sound harmless. In reality, you’re opting out of the free coaching, systems, and community that great sponsors provide. Without a sponsor, you’ll only get eXp’s standard tools and training which, while they are great, they are not the private masterminds, onboarding help, or revenue share guidance that can transform your business. If you’re joining anyway, why pass up the chance to connect with a powerhouse team like Smart Agent Alliance that’s built to fast-track both your production and passive income?</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> When you fill out your eXp application, double-check the sponsor field before you hit submit because if it’s blank, you can’t retroactively claim the value of a top-tier sponsor team. However, if you realize the mistake <em>before</em> you’re active at eXp, you can <a href=\"https://support.expcloud.com/portal/en/kb/articles/how-to-contact-agent-onboarding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact eXp Support</a> to correct it. Once you’re active with eXp, your only option is leaving for 12 months and rejoining.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-unassigned-agents-still-contribute-to-the-rev-share-pool\">Do Unassigned Agents Still Contribute to the Rev Share Pool?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Your commissions still trigger revenue share payouts even if you don’t name a sponsor. The catch? You have no control over who gets paid, and they won’t lift a finger to help you, mostly because they have no idea you exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why don’t they know? Because without a sponsor, the money your deals generate gets tossed into a bonus pool paid to Tiers 1–3 in someone else’s upline. It’s not personal. It’s just math. That “extra” is pulled from eXp’s 20% company dollar until you cap, so it doesn’t feel like a bill, but it is money you could have working for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going sponsorless is like paying for a subscription you never use, except the “service” you’re skipping is support, training, and growth guidance. Handing free income to a random agent with no expectation of return is business malpractice. With Smart Agent Alliance, every dollar you generate also funds your free tools, live masterminds, and done-for-you agent attraction funnel so you actually see a return on the revenue you create.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-i-attract-an-e-xp-downline-if-i-dont-have-an-upline\">Can I Attract an eXp Downline if I Don’t Have an Upline?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, but if you don’t have a primary sponsor, the smartest move is to <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-launches-co-sponsor-program/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">become the co-sponsor</a> for your recruits and partner with a powerhouse primary sponsor team. That way you can leverage their proven systems, training, and credibility to attract agents to join eXp while you still earn 7 levels of revenue share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s why it matters: Without a strong sponsor line, attracting and keeping agents is an uphill climb. Your recruits will want to know what kind of onboarding, coaching, and resources they’ll get. If the only answer is “me,” you’re asking them to buy into an untested solo act. By teaming up with a proven sponsor team, like Smart Agent Alliance, as the primary sponsor, you can instantly leverage their full stack of value to attract agents. Meet the proven sponsor teams guidelines and you can even earn the use of the sponsor’s value for your personal use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By promoting a strong sponsor to be the primary sponsor, you still get credit as the co-sponsor, meaning you participate in 7 levels of revenue share. The difference is, now your recruits stay longer, produce more, and bring in their own agents because they’re plugged into a sponsor line with a track record of winning. Co-sponsoring isn’t just a workaround; it’s the leverage play that lets you build a downline without building the infrastructure from scratch.

If you want a downline, pair with a proven primary sponsor and step in as co-sponsor where you’ll still earn 7 levels of rev share while your recruits get top-tier support.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1755650642910\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Does eXp Assign Me a Sponsor If I Leave the Field Blank?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>No. eXp’s current practice is to leave your upline blank if you don’t name a sponsor.

Without a sponsor, the revenue share from your deals goes into a bonus pool for someone else’s Tier 1–3. They won’t know you, so they won’t help you because they don’t even know you’re paying them.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1755650681702\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Can I Get Support If I Don’t Have a Sponsor?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>You’ll get eXp’s baseline tools, training, and community, but nothing extra.

    "content": "\n<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> At eXp Realty, a sponsor is the agent you name when joining who most influenced your decision to sign up. They’re not your boss. They’re your connection to an upline network, with potentially tools, training, community, and mentorship. The right sponsor can shortcut your success; the wrong one can leave you ghosted with zero support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tl-dr-about-what-e-xp-sponsors-do\"><strong>TL;DR About What eXp Sponsors Do</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Connect you to your seven-tier upline at eXp Realty</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide mentorship, systems, and agent attraction tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No required support — sponsors choose their involvement level</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Big-name sponsors bring reach; engaged ones bring results</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smart Agent Alliance + Wolf Pack = double the value stack</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever joined a brokerage thinking you’d get hands-on guidance, only to find your mentor’s “support” was an occasional email? At eXp, your sponsor isn’t just a name on your application — they’re your first link in a <a href=\"https://expknowledgebase.exprealty.com/knowledge/revenue-share\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seven-tier upline</a> that can unlock training, marketing tools, and collaboration opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;But the value you get in an eXp sponsor isn’t automatic. Some sponsors bring full systems, lead funnels, and active coaching. Some sponsors are hands-on, investing real time and money into your success. Others… well, let’s just say their version of “support” is liking your Instagram post once a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\"><h2>Table of Contents</h2><nav><div><div><a href=\"#what-is-an-upline-and-why-does-it-matter\">What Is an Upline and Why Does It Matter?</a></div><div><a href=\"#what-kind-of-support-can-a-sponsor-provide-at-e-xp\">What Kind of Support Can a Sponsor Provide at eXp?</a><div><div><a href=\"#examples-from-smart-agent-alliance-wolf-pack\">Examples from Smart Agent Alliance + Wolf Pack:</a></div></div></div><div><a href=\"#do-e-xp-sponsors-have-any-obligation-to-help-their-downline\">Do eXp Sponsors Have Any Obligation to Help Their Downline?</a></div><div><a href=\"#why-do-some-e-xp-sponsors-offer-more-value-than-others\">Why Do Some eXp Sponsors Offer More Value than Others?</a></div><div><a href=\"#what-happens-if-your-sponsor-or-upline-stops-providing-support\">What Happens if Your Sponsor or Upline Stops Providing Support?</a></div><div><a href=\"#how-is-sponsor-support-different-from-brokerage-level-support\">How Is Sponsor Support Different from Brokerage-Level Support?</a></div><div><a href=\"#why-this-topic-matters-before-you-join-e-xp-realty\">Why This Topic Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</a><div><div><a href=\"#what-you-get-with-smart-agent-alliance-sponsor-team\">What you get with Smart Agent Alliance (sponsor team)</a><div><div><a href=\"#dual-sponsorship-power\">Dual Sponsorship Power</a></div><div><a href=\"#top-real-estate-coaching\">Top Real Estate Coaching:</a></div><div><a href=\"#marketing-assets\">Marketing Assets</a></div><div><a href=\"#plug-play-systems-for-you-to-gain-passive-income\">Plug &amp; Play Systems for you to gain passive income:</a></div><div><a href=\"#inspiring-community\">Inspiring Community:</a></div></div></div></div></div><div><a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</a><div></div></div></div></nav></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-an-upline-and-why-does-it-matter\">What Is an Upline and Why Does It Matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Your upline is the chain of up to seven agents above you at eXp Realty, starting with your sponsor. Their skills, systems, and involvement directly affect your access to training, tools, and mentorship. A strong upline can fast-track your growth; a weak one leaves you figuring it out alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eXp Realty, your sponsor is just the start. The agents above them — your Tier 2 through Tier 7 upline — can collectively be a goldmine of resources, or a ghost town. This isn’t corporate HR; it’s a network where access is earned by choosing wisely on day one.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/What-Is-an-Upline-and-Why-Does-It-Matter.webp\" alt=\"What Is an Upline and Why Does It Matter\" class=\"wp-image-270094 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/What-Is-an-Upline-and-Why-Does-It-Matter.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/What-Is-an-Upline-and-Why-Does-It-Matter-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Doug Smart and Karrie Hill’s Smart Agent Alliance connects you not only to their systems but also to the Wolf Pack’s national reach. That means you benefit from two leadership teams with proven track records in different market conditions — a built-in safety net of experience you can’t build solo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-kind-of-support-can-a-sponsor-provide-at-e-xp\">What Kind of Support Can a Sponsor Provide at eXp?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At eXp, sponsor support isn’t mandated. Support ranges from nothing to full-blown business systems. The best sponsors provide training, lead-gen tools, marketing assets, step-by-step attraction systems and an actual supportive community that cares about you. I know, imagine that!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you choose well, your sponsor can hand you ready-made tools that cover everything you need to up your real estate agent game. They’ll also connect you to a community that shares ideas, collaborates on deals, and helps you adapt to market changes faster than if you were working alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"examples-from-smart-agent-alliance-wolf-pack\">Examples from Smart Agent Alliance + Wolf Pack:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Nick D. – Facebook Groups to Triple Production</strong><br>In a saturated second-home market with over 500 agents, Nick built a niche buyer-focused Facebook group that 3X’d his business in 12 months — no ads, no cold calls, no spam. Just the right systems and guidance to turn community into contracts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stacey – 54 Deals from Local Networking Groups</strong><br>Starting in a brand-new market with zero contacts, Stacey closed 54 deals in one year by strategically joining and leading local business networking groups. No video, no paid ads — just relationship-based systems that make her a referral magnet.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Slater S. – One FSBO Listing Every Week</strong><br>Slater, a Seattle-based agent, generates a steady pipeline of high-value listings using a proven FSBO calling and follow-up system. The result? Over $5M under contract in just one quarter, all from free, repeatable scripts that work in any market.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The pattern is clear: the right sponsor doesn’t just offer help — they provide repeatable systems that anyone can plug into for predictable results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-e-xp-sponsors-have-any-obligation-to-help-their-downline\">Do eXp Sponsors Have Any Obligation to Help Their Downline?</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:35% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Do-eXp-Sponsors-Have-Any-Obligation-to-Help-Their-Downline-1.webp\" alt=\"Do eXp Sponsors Have Any Obligation to Help Their Downline 1\" class=\"wp-image-270105 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Do-eXp-Sponsors-Have-Any-Obligation-to-Help-Their-Downline-1.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Do-eXp-Sponsors-Have-Any-Obligation-to-Help-Their-Downline-1-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>No. eXp Realty does not require sponsors to provide any form of support. Whether you get hands-on help or radio silence depends entirely on the sponsor you choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most misunderstood parts of the eXp Realty model. Sponsors earn revenue share from the company dollar when their downline closes deals, but they are under zero obligation to teach you how to make those deals happen.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most misunderstood parts of the eXp Realty model. Sponsors earn revenue share from the company dollar when their downline closes deals, but they are under zero obligation to teach you how to make those deals happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why your decision is so critical. If you pick a sponsor without systems or accountability in place, they have no incentive to build them later. You could be left piecing together a business model from random YouTube videos and free Facebook groups — not exactly a competitive advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> With Smart Agent Alliance, you step into a full infrastructure on day one — from onboarding checklists to niche lead-gen playbooks like FSBO outreach or networking-based referral systems. There’s no “figure it out yourself” phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-do-some-e-xp-sponsors-offer-more-value-than-others\">Why Do Some eXp Sponsors Offer More Value than Others?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some sponsors see revenue share as an investment in their agents’ success; others see it as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_income\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passive income</a> they don’t need to earn. The best sponsors reinvest in proven tools, training, and systems to help you succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The value you get from a sponsor usually depends on their mindset, resources, and track record. A solo agent sponsor may have great intentions but lack the time or systems to help more than a few agents. On the other hand, a sponsor embedded in a high-performance team can plug you into shared resources that scale without losing personal touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wolf Pack and Smart Agent Alliance combo works because both have complementary strengths:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>SAA</strong> brings hands-on onboarding, plug-and-play marketing systems and agent attraction tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wolf Pack</strong> delivers national training, niche growth strategies, and access to leaders like Mike Sherrard, who have coached agents to success in nearly every market condition.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsors who deliver real value do so consistently, regardless of market shifts. That’s the kind of stability agents need to thrive long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-if-your-sponsor-or-upline-stops-providing-support\">What Happens if Your Sponsor or Upline Stops Providing Support?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your sponsor or upline stops engaging, you keep their name in your record and lose their direct involvement. eXp will not replace them, and your only way to change is to leave for 12 months and rejoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/What-Happens-if-Your-Sponsor-or-Upline-Stops-Providing-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"What Happens if Your Sponsor or Upline Stops Providing Support 1\" class=\"wp-image-270106 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/What-Happens-if-Your-Sponsor-or-Upline-Stops-Providing-Support-1.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/What-Happens-if-Your-Sponsor-or-Upline-Stops-Providing-Support-1-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This is where agents who didn’t vet their sponsor up front get stuck. Losing sponsor support doesn’t mean losing eXp’s brokerage-level help — you’ll still get tech, compliance, and transaction assistance — but the personalized guidance and systems you counted on may vanish overnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to pick a sponsor with a history of sustained involvement. Look for evidence of active mastermind groups, ongoing content creation, and consistent agent wins — not just a flashy sales pitch.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Smart Agent Alliance with the Wolf Pack has maintained weekly training calls for years, even through market downturns, platform changes, and shifting trends. Agents know they can count on the same level of support next year as they do today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-is-sponsor-support-different-from-brokerage-level-support\">How Is Sponsor Support Different from Brokerage-Level Support?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brokerage-level support at eXp covers contracts, compliance, and core tools. Sponsor support is about growth — lead generation, business strategy, and mentorship tailored to your goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it this way: eXp gives you the tools, but your sponsor gives you the blueprint. Without a strong sponsor, you might have the hammer, nails, and lumber — but no plan for the house you’re trying to build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brokerage-level support ensures you can complete transactions compliantly. Sponsor support teaches you how to find those transactions in the first place, close them faster, and generate referrals for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> A sponsor who provides a Facebook group strategy that generates triple production (like Nick D.’s) is delivering something brokerage-level resources can’t match — direct market-tested playbooks that bring in warm, high-intent leads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-this-topic-matters-before-you-join-e-xp-realty\">Why This Topic Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your sponsor choice determines your upline, the systems you can access, and the speed at which you can grow. A co-sponsor can add extra local or niche expertise — but only if they’re willing and able to deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp\" alt=\"Black and white photo of Karrie Hill and Doug Smart with the bold gold SAA logo overlaid, representing the leadership of Smart Agent Alliance.\" class=\"wp-image-267426 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>At eXp, you’re not just joining a brokerage — you’re joining a network.

Your sponsor choice shapes your training, systems access, and revenue share potential — and once locked, it’s permanent unless you leave for 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tl-dr-about-the-e-xp-sponsor-program\">TL;DR About the eXp Sponsor Program</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Names your primary sponsor when joining eXp Realty</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Controls your upline connection and extra resources</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Co-sponsor option available within 5 days of joining</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Primary sponsor is permanent unless you leave for 12 months</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smart Agent Alliance + Wolf Pack = dual value stack</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re joining eXp Realty, you’re not just picking a brokerage. You’re picking a business network that sticks with you. And here’s the kicker: the sponsor role at eXp is like nothing you’ll find anywhere else. Traditional brokerages? You get whatever your broker offers — end of story. Other online brokerages with “sponsor programs”? Agents there can only parrot the company’s standard offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At eXp, sponsors can get wildly creative, building <strong>exclusive tools, training, resources, and communities</strong> that go far beyond the corporate menu. The right sponsor line doesn’t just hand you the company goods; they hand you a business accelerator you didn’t even know you needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick your sponsor well, and you’re ramping up like a Tesla.

That can mean plug-and-play systems, marketing tools, recruiting funnels, mastermind access, and a community you can lean on daily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsor involvement varies wildly. Some offer value worth tens of thousands in saved time and trial-and-error. Others… well, you’ll have an easier time getting a price reduction from a seller mid-escrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When your sponsor is part of a high-performing sponsor team like <strong>Smart Agent Alliance + Wolf Pack</strong>, you inherit years of proven strategies, national referral connections, and a culture of collaboration. That’s the difference between figuring it out alone and plugging into a machine that’s already built to scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> One Wolf Pack agent in a small coastal market tripled GCI in 12 months using our team’s YouTube + Facebook group playbook without buying a single lead. That’s the power of a sponsor team that invests in your growth, not just your headcount.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"primary-sponsor-rules-at-e-xp-realty-what-to-know-before-you-commit\">Primary Sponsor Rules at eXp Realty: What to Know Before You Commit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our full guide to </em><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/need-sponsor\"><em>Primary Sponsors at eXp</em></a><em> for deeper detail.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your primary sponsor choice shapes your entire upline and is locked once you’re “active.” You can name any active eXp agent, but after activation, if you’re unhappy with your choice, you’ll have to make life altering sacrifices to make a change…more on that below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The lone exception for a quick change is if you made a mistake in your eXp application and you catch it before you go active at eXp. <a href=\"https://support.expcloud.com/portal/en/kb/articles/how-to-contact-agent-onboarding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact onboarding support</a> in that case to fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join eXp without naming a sponsor, but you’ll get only <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/about-exp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp’s baseline tools which are, in fact, industry gold standards</a>.&nbsp; But you won’t get extra sponsor team systems.

Get it right, and you’re tapped into proven systems, ones that can motivate and inspire you, from day one. Get it wrong, and you’re on your own trying to navigate eXp World without a map.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-you-need-a-co-sponsor-at-e-xp-realty\">Do You Need a Co-Sponsor at eXp Realty?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our full guide to </em><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/need-cosponsor\"><em>eXp Co-Sponsorship</em></a><em> for all the nitty gritty details.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, co-sponsors are optional. Like we already mentioned, you can add one within 5 days of being “active” at eXp. You can also can request a change of co-sponsor later by petition if you have a valid reason. Co-sponsors don’t connect you to their upline. Their benefit is whatever they personally bring to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great co-sponsor fills gaps your primary sponsor can’t. Think hyperlocal market knowledge, niche marketing skills, or one-on-one deal support. A bad one is just another person collecting a slice of the company dollar without moving your business forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> You join Smart Agent Alliance for top training, national systems and attraction strategies. You add a local top producer as co-sponsor for farm-area pricing tactics and contract reviews. The result? A full-scale business engine plus a custom spotlight on your exact market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-you-change-your-sponsor-at-e-xp-realty\">Can You Change Your Sponsor at eXp Realty?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our full guide about </em><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/change-sponsor\"><em>changing eXp sponsors</em></a><em> to get the details.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re active, your primary sponsor is locked in permanently. The only way to choose a new one is to leave eXp for a full 12 months and then rejoin.&nbsp; Making that move means forfeiting any unvested stock and walking away from your existing downline. As we already mentioned, eXp doesn’t make exceptions unless there’s a user error caught before approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Can-You-Change-Your-Sponsor-at-eXp-Realty.webp\" alt=\"Can You Change Your Sponsor at eXp Realty\" class=\"wp-image-270072 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Can-You-Change-Your-Sponsor-at-eXp-Realty.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Can-You-Change-Your-Sponsor-at-eXp-Realty-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This is why you don’t pick your sponsor casually. You’re not choosing a lunch buddy; you’re choosing a long-term business partner who controls your access to an entire upline’s systems, training, and community. So, carefully vet your sponsor team’s value before you join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-sponsors are a little different. You can petition to change them if there’s a valid reason, but approval isn’t guaranteed. So, apply the same due diligence in choosing a great co-sponsor for you. If they can’t clearly explain what they’ll provide, skip them.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> When a sponsor says they offer weekly meetings, ask how many agents actually show up. Our team calls pull in 100–200 agents every call. Our team calls pull in 100–200 agents every week — pretty sure that’s the highest attendance rate at eXp. Attendance is a clear sign of where the real value is… and where it isn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-sponsor-team-vs-real-estate-production-team-key-differences\">eXp Sponsor Team vs. Real Estate Production Team — Key Differences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our full guide to the </em><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/sponsor-vs-team\"><em>difference between eXp sponsor teams and real estate production teams</em></a><em> for more details.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sponsor teams = scalable systems, upline resources, and revenue share potential.<br>Production teams = shared deals, leads, and commission splits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can (and many do) join both. Agents join production teams for boots-on-the-ground deal flow today and sponsor teams for niche training, motivation, and scalable, passive income for tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know, a sponsor team, which can exist anywhere in the world, connects you to your 7-level upline and the value they’ve built. A production team, on the other hand, is local and transaction-focused. You’ll typically share leads, split commissions, pool marketing costs, and lean on team transaction support. It’s great for short-term cash flow, but the benefits end when the deals do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Smart Agent Alliance agents run with both setups: one that pays you today, and one that keeps paying you long after the deal paperwork is filed away. It’s the difference between owning a rental property and having a weekend yard sale — one builds lasting income, the other keeps you hustling for the next Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick Comparison</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color has-fixed-layout\" style=\"background:linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(255,247,218) 0%,rgb(255,229,212) 100%)\"><thead><tr><td><strong>Feature / Focus</strong></td><td><strong>eXp Sponsor Team</strong></td><td><strong>Real Estate Production Team</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Purpose</strong></td><td>Grow your business through systems, training, and upline support</td><td>Work together on transactions and share commissions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tied to Revenue Share</strong></td><td>Yes – connects you to your 7-level upline</td><td>No – commissions only</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Location</strong></td><td>Can be national or global</td><td>Always local to your market</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Value Duration</strong></td><td>Ongoing, even after deals close</td><td>Ends when you leave the team</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Income Potential</strong></td><td>Scales with team growth and agent attraction</td><td>Limited to active deals you’re part of</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-sponsor-vs-mentor-whats-the-real-difference\">eXp Sponsor vs. Mentor — What’s the Real Difference?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our full guide to </em><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/sponsor-vs-mentor\"><em>eXp sponsors vs. eXp mentors</em></a><em> for the deeper details.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By now you know the drill that a sponsor is <strong>permanent</strong> and tied to your revenue share. A mentor is <strong>temporary</strong> and assigned to agents with fewer than three closed transactions in the past 12 months. Their job is to guide you through your first deals, help with contracts and transaction flow until you “graduate” from the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is your long-term business partner; the other is your on-ramp coach. Sponsors can (and often do) offer creative, exclusive value like marketing funnels, training libraries, and mastermind groups. Mentors stick to the eXp-approved curriculum and transaction support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, your eXp certified mentor and eXp sponsor are the same person — which, if you pick well, means seamless onboarding and long-term growth under one roof. But don’t confuse the two: a mentor is there to make sure your early transactions don’t implode, while your sponsor is there to make sure your career doesn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-e-xp-sponsorship-means-for-team-leaders-at-e-xp-realty\">What eXp Sponsorship Means for Team Leaders at eXp Realty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our full guide to </em><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/for-team-leaders\"><em>eXp sponsors for team leaders</em></a><em> for more details.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For team leaders, sponsorship is completely separate from any production team agreement. You can keep your brand, splits, and operations exactly as they are while plugging your entire roster into a powerhouse upline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your agents keep working under your leadership, but — if your sponsor offers real value — they also gain access to additional systems, training, and a wider network layered on top of what you already provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For agents already at eXp, the new co-sponsor program makes it possible to future-proof your recruiting. You can’t change your own sponsor, but you can have any new recruits name Smart Agent Alliance as their sponsor and you as their co-sponsor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ll still get your leadership, and you’ll be able to leverage a complete value stack you didn’t have to spend time or money building. Best of all, you still unlock 7 tiers of revenue share <em>and</em> the Fast Start bonus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-this-topic-matters-before-you-join-e-xp-realty\">Why This Topic Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your sponsor team controls your access to upline resources, passive income potential, and whether you’ll have to reinvent the wheel or just start driving.

If you leave the sponsor field blank, you’ll go active without one and eXp will not assign one for you. But without a sponsor, you’ll miss all the extra training, systems, and community that come from being plugged into a powerhouse sponsor team.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1755376169900\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What’s the difference between a sponsor and a co-sponsor at eXp?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>A sponsor is the licensed agent you name on your join application, and they connect you to their entire upline (up to seven tiers). A co-sponsor is optional, must be added within 5 days, and only gives you access to what they personally provide, not their upline.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1755376182316\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Can I change my sponsor at eXp Realty?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Not once you’re active. The only way to change a primary sponsor is to leave eXp for 12 months, forfeit unvested stock, and rejoin.

Others may provide very little. At eXp, sponsor support isn’t required, so your experience depends on who you choose.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1755376220722\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What’s the difference between a sponsor and a mentor at eXp Realty?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>A sponsor is permanent and tied to your revenue share.

Sometimes they’re the same person, but they serve very different roles.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1755376232555\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">How does sponsorship affect team leaders?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Sponsorship is separate from production team agreements. You can keep your brand, splits, and operations while plugging your roster into your sponsor’s upline systems. With the new co-sponsor program, even existing eXp leaders can recruit agents who name Smart Agent Alliance as sponsor and themselves as co-sponsor — unlocking recruiting leverage without rebuilding a value stack from scratch.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1755376243146\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Why is sponsor choice so important at eXp?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Because it’s permanent after activation and it dictates the resources, systems, and community you can access.

You name them on your <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">join eXp Realty application</a>. That choice locks in your support line and determines which upline, systems, and communities you can access. If your sponsor is well-organized, you’ll gain value far beyond eXp’s standard tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Sponsors are paid from eXp’s company dollar, so their support doesn’t cost you extra. But not all sponsors actually deliver value—some promise big and give little and others charge you a fee (but eXp Realty doesn’t charge anything).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agents who rush this choice often regret it, finding themselves without the systems, coaching, or connections that shorten ramp time and boost income. Pick a sponsor team that already delivers real value today, not promises tomorrow.</p>\n</div><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/What-is-an-eXp-Sponsor-and-how-are-they-named.webp\" alt=\"What is an eXp Sponsor and how are they named\" class=\"wp-image-270041 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/What-is-an-eXp-Sponsor-and-how-are-they-named.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/What-is-an-eXp-Sponsor-and-how-are-they-named-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-name-your-sponsor-correctly\">How to name your sponsor correctly</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start your eXp Realty application.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the Sponsor field, enter your sponsor’s legal name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Confirm spelling and license status with the sponsor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep a screenshot of your entry for your records.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-good-sponsors-actually-do\">What good sponsors actually do</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Help you close more deals faster</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide high-quality training that goes beyond the basics</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supply marketing assets and templates</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer consistent weekly meetings for the community and support</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Teach you how to create a revenue share income stream</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Deliver value without charging extra</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example –</strong> Jasmine’s Ramp-Up Success: Jasmine left a small local brokerage wanting accountability and proven systems.

The only way to choose a new one is to leave for a full twelve months and then rejoin. Co-sponsors follow the same concept, though they can sometimes be changed by request if there’s a valid reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This policy is why the sponsor choice is so critical. Agents who pick without vetting often feel stuck when their sponsor’s promises don’t pan out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sponsor-link-timeline\">Sponsor link timeline</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color has-fixed-layout\" style=\"background-color:#fffac2\"><thead><tr><th><strong>Situation</strong></th><th><strong>Result</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stay at eXp without a break</td><td>Sponsor remains the same</td></tr><tr><td>Leave and rejoin in under 12 months</td><td>Original sponsor remains</td></tr><tr><td>Leave and rejoin after 12 months</td><td>You may choose a new sponsor</td></tr><tr><td>*Onboarding error caught before approval</td><td>Admin may correct the record</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example –</strong> Diego’s Long-Term Win: Diego joined in March and named Ana as sponsor. Three years later, he considered switching but stayed because her coaching still delivered results. His early choice set him up for consistent growth without disruption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-if-you-dont-name-a-sponsor-when-joining\">What Happens if You Don&#8217;t Name a Sponsor When Joining?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join eXp without a sponsor, but you’ll miss out on access to a sponsor’s upline, systems, and extra training. You’ll still get eXp’s core tools, but your growth will rely entirely on what you build yourself. Once onboarding is complete, you can’t add a sponsor without leaving for 12 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many agents who join sponsorless end up with slower ramp times, less accountability, and fewer lead-generation opportunities. A co-sponsor cannot replace the missing sponsor role.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pros-and-cons-of-joining-without-a-sponsor\">Pros and cons of joining without a sponsor</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color has-fixed-layout\" style=\"background:linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(255,254,201) 0%,rgb(178,240,255) 100%)\"><thead><tr><th>Decision</th><th>Upside</th><th>Downside</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Join with no sponsor</td><td>You avoid choosing</td><td>No upline, no team systems, slower ramp</td></tr><tr><td>Join with a sponsor team</td><td>You can get ready-made tools and coaching if offered</td><td>You must do due diligence upfront</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Example – Chris’s Missed Leverage: Chris joined sponsorless to “figure it out later.” Six months in, he realized he needed advanced scripts and listing help. His only path was to leave for a year and rejoin, delaying his business growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-the-differences-between-a-sponsor-and-co-sponsor\">What Are the Differences Between a Sponsor and a Co-Sponsor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your eXp sponsor is your primary business influencer and the only one who connects you to an upline. A co-sponsor is an optional, single additional helper you choose after joining. Both may earn revenue share from the company dollar, but only your sponsor’s upline structure will ever factor into your long-term support and growth potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing wisely matters because your sponsor’s systems, community, and leadership can accelerate your production or leave you figuring things out alone. A co-sponsor might provide valuable niche knowledge or local insight, but they cannot replace a strong primary sponsor. Many agents mistakenly believe a co-sponsor can “fix” a weak sponsor choice, only to find their growth stalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"comparison-at-a-glance\">Comparison at a glance</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color has-fixed-layout\" style=\"background:linear-gradient(135deg,rgb(245,255,199) 0%,rgb(245,197,255) 100%)\"><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Sponsor</th><th>Co-Sponsor</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>When selected</td><td>During onboarding</td><td>Within five days after you join</td></tr><tr><td>Required to join</td><td>No, but strongly advised</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Upline access</td><td>Yes, through sponsor only</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue share eligibility</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Change after joining</td><td>Only by leaving 12 months, except admin error</td><td>Possible by request with cause</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: How to split roles<br>Angela joins eXp and names a sponsor who provides her with weekly training calls, ready-to-use marketing templates, and agent attraction support from their upline team. She also selects a co-sponsor who specializes in her farm area, meeting her twice a month for market strategy. The combination gives her both broad business growth and hyperlocal execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-your-options-if-you-joined-without-naming-a-sponsor\">What Are Your Options if You Joined Without Naming a Sponsor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you join eXp without a sponsor, your options are extremely limited after onboarding. You may correct a clear error before approval, but once active, the only way to gain a sponsor is to leave for twelve months and rejoin. A co-sponsor cannot fill this gap. They are an add-on, not a substitute for a primary sponsor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This matters because agents without a sponsor lose direct access to proven upline systems, mentorship, and extra marketing tools. While eXp’s core training is solid, going sponsorless often means a slower ramp-up, fewer warm leads, and more trial-and-error. Many agents regret the decision after realizing they could have leveraged a sponsor’s ready-made playbooks from day one.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>Decision tree</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Add a co-sponsor only within the open window and only if you already have a sponsor in place.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are you still in onboarding?

From instant collaboration to easy resource sharing, Slack has become the digital HQ that keeps agents moving forward.

In its place: organized channels for announcements, team chats, and referrals. Instead of hunting for a training replay buried in yesterday’s scroll, you’ll find it pinned neatly in your channel’s Canvas tab. Translation: more time growing your business, fewer gray hairs waiting for updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Important Update: eXp’s old Workplace platform becomes read-only on August 31, 2025. And a heads-up — <em>expworkspace.com</em> is a phishing site. Don’t click. Don’t log in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-slack-channels-at-e-xp\">What Are Slack Channels at eXp?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/360017938993-What-is-a-channel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slack Channels</a> are topic-based chat rooms where agents connect on everything from referrals to AI tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Some are public and open to all eXp agents, while others are private or invite-only.

A Canvas might include onboarding guides, training replays, and a calendar of upcoming masterminds. Instead of emailing attachments back and forth, everything is in one place — always up to date, always accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: A top-producing team might have a Canvas with a 30-day new agent roadmap, marketing templates, and scripts. New agents plug in and start running without a learning curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-slack-huddles-and-why-do-they-matter\">What Are Slack Huddles (And Why Do They Matter)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In short,</strong> <a href=\"https://slack.com/help/articles/4402059015315-Use-huddles-in-Slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slack huddles</a> are instant voice or video calls inside Slack that make teamwork painless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you’re in a channel brainstorming an open house strategy. Instead of typing a novel in chat, you start a huddle, knock out a plan in five minutes, and get back to prospecting. That’s how agents keep deals moving without losing a whole day to back-and-forth messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-can-you-create-your-own-channel-at-e-xp\">How Can You Create Your Own Channel at eXp?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Agents can request new channels through the Grid Connection app inside Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/How-Can-You-Create-Your-Own-Channel-at-eXp.webp\" alt=\"How Can You Create Your Own Channel at eXp\" class=\"wp-image-269986 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/How-Can-You-Create-Your-Own-Channel-at-eXp.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/How-Can-You-Create-Your-Own-Channel-at-eXp-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>You decide if it’s public (open to all eXp agents) or private (just for your team).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example: </strong>If you’re building an AI-focused mastermind group, you could launch a public channel called “AI Geeks,” invite like-minded agents, and fill the Canvas with prompt packs, training links, and referral opportunities.

It categorizes your emails so urgent client requests and hot new leads rise to the top while spam and low-priority noise get filed away. Expect to see folders like <strong>To Respond, Awaiting Reply, FYI, and Action Items</strong> so you immediately know where to focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you open one of those high-priority emails, Fyxer has already drafted a reply in your own tone. You still review and edit it before sending—so you stay in control—but starting from a thoughtful draft is much faster than staring at a blank screen. Most agents find they can hit send in seconds instead of minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/How-Does-Fyxer-AI-Help-eXp-Realty-Agents.webp\" alt=\"How Does Fyxer AI Help eXp Realty Agents\" class=\"wp-image-269957 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/How-Does-Fyxer-AI-Help-eXp-Realty-Agents.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/How-Does-Fyxer-AI-Help-eXp-Realty-Agents-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Fyxer also embeds your calendar links so clients can instantly book time with you—no more back-and-forth.

Fyxer listens in (with your permission) on Zoom, Teams, or Meet calls, then drops a concise recap plus a draft follow-up email into your inbox. No more scribbled notes you can’t read later.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s the kicker:</strong> speed. Studies show 50% of deals go to the first agent who responds. With Fyxer categorizing, drafting, and reminding, you’ll be the agent who replies first—and wins more business because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it as a virtual assistant who never takes a day off, doesn’t need training, and makes you look like you’ve got a whole back office working behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-did-e-xp-add-fyxer-and-why-it-matters\">When Did eXp Add Fyxer (And Why It Matters)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/solutions-exp_exptools-fyxerai-realestatesuccess-activity-7328403727080452097-qfTF/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty rolled out Fyxer AI</a> as part of its ongoing mission to be <em>the most agent-centric brokerage on the planet</em>. And this isn’t some one-off gimmick—it’s part of a long pattern. Over the past five years, eXp has been the only cumulatively profitable publicly traded brokerage, which means it actually has the money to keep upping the game with tools that matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the deal: <strong>CAP and ICON agents get Fyxer completely free</strong>—a no-brainer perk for top producers who are already juggling inbox chaos. All other eXp agents get <strong>a special discounted rate</strong> through the eXp-branded signup page, making it far more affordable than retail pricing. Outside of eXp, agents pay $30–$50 per month for the same tool—so the savings add up quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottom line? eXp is investing its profits right back into agents, giving you enterprise-level AI tools without enterprise-level costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"who-benefits-most-from-fyxer\">Who Benefits Most From Fyxer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fyxer isn’t a one?size?fits?all tool.

It’s the difference between being buried in emails and being the agent who actually calls back first. But here’s the kicker: tools like Fyxer are just the start. You can buy systems like these elsewhere, but when you join under Karrie and Doug’s Smart Agent Alliance at eXp Realty, you don’t pay extra if you’re a capping agent; you get it for free.

It’s designed <em>exclusively for real estate</em>. Mike created it to give agents step-by-step guidance on using tools like ChatGPT, Manis, Gamma, and Google AI Studio. Whether you’re brand new to AI or already experimenting, the Accelerator adapts to your level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of wasting money on expensive prospecting coaches or done-for-you marketing agencies, you’ll learn how to take full control of your lead generation and branding — and do it better. This way, you own the process and never depend on someone else to drive your business growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of paying thousands for a monthly content plan, you can generate customized Facebook ads and matching images in minutes, or role-play FSBO objections with ChatGPT’s voice mode to sharpen your skills without a coach.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-the-ai-agent-accelerator\">What Is the AI Agent Accelerator?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the answer: The AI Agent Accelerator is Mike Sherrard’s step?by?step program built exclusively for real estate agents. It blends cutting?edge AI tools with clear, real?estate?specific training so you can actually generate leads, save 10+ hours a week, and scale your business — even if your idea of “techy” is updating your iPhone once a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forget the overpriced prospecting coaches and the “done?for?you” marketing agencies that bleed you dry while handing you cookie?cutter content. The Accelerator hands you proven prompt packs, pre?built workflows, and tactical roadmaps designed for agents — not generic entrepreneurs. Translation: you stay in control, you own your branding, and you’re not chained to someone else’s idea of what your business should look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Real?world example:</strong> One agent fired her $1,200/month content service after discovering she could generate Facebook ads <em>and the matching images</em> in minutes — with better results. Another agent role?played FSBO objections with ChatGPT’s voice mode until her confidence was so sharp, her $1,000?a?month coach would’ve been out of a job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this isn’t theory. As agents in our Smart Agent Alliance like to say, the Accelerator is basically “real estate on steroids.” Think sharper branding, faster content, and pipelines so full you’ll have to start saying no.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"551\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-agent-accelerator-core-benefits-1024x551.webp\" alt=\"Infographic listing AI Agent Accelerator benefits for real estate agents, including time savings, lead growth, cost efficiency, confidence boost, and future-proof skills\" class=\"wp-image-269933\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-agent-accelerator-core-benefits-1024x551.webp 1024w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-agent-accelerator-core-benefits-300x162.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-agent-accelerator-core-benefits-768x414.webp 768w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ai-agent-accelerator-core-benefits.webp 1090w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-included-in-ai-for-real-estate-agents-training\">What’s Included in AI for Real Estate Agents Training?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the answer: You get a complete AI toolkit plus hands?on training designed specifically for real estate agents. From objection?handling role?plays to ad creation and deep market research, the Accelerator shows you exactly how to plug AI into your business so you can generate more leads, save time, and finally ditch overpriced “done?for?you” services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s be honest: most “AI trainings” feel like they were built for tech bros in hoodies, not agents juggling showings, contracts, and a family group chat that never sleeps. The AI Agent Accelerator skips the fluff and gives you real, step?by?step workflows you can use today without needing to become the next Mark Zuckerberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you’ll access inside:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>AI?Generated Ad Copy &amp; Images</strong> customized for your market (no more generic Canva templates)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Deep Market Research via Manis</strong> to uncover hidden seller leads your competition misses</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Social Media Content Strategies</strong> for YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok have all proven to convert</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>AI Clones &amp; Automation</strong> for email, scheduling, and lead nurturing</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prospecting Role?Play</strong> with ChatGPT’s voice mode to master FSBO and expired objections</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Step?by?Step Walkthroughs</strong> covering every major workflow you’ll actually use</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Real?world example:</strong> Instead of burning $1,500 a month on a social media manager, one agent uploaded five recent Instagram posts with their analytics. In minutes, AI flagged which hooks flopped, rewrote captions that actually convert, and spit out a step?by?step plan to triple her engagement. Try getting that level of feedback from your nephew who “knows TikTok.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources.png\" alt=\"a yellow diamond on a white background\" class=\"wp-image-248129 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources.png 256w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><em>“What Mike has done is now made this specifically indigenous for our real estate business.

It’s about giving you simple, plug?and?play AI tools that handle the boring stuff so you can get back to closings, open houses, and, let’s be real, pretending you don’t check your phone every five minutes for that “new lead” notification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s who sees the biggest impact:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>New Agents:</strong> Get a playbook that eliminates guesswork and ramps up production faster than cold?calling your entire contact list.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Experienced Agents:</strong> Cut 60% of your weekly grind while tripling your leads. No overpriced VA required.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tech?Curious Agents:</strong> Use powerful AI tools without coding or buying a $5,000 “tech accelerator” you’ll regret later.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Busy Teams:</strong> Automate follow?up, scheduling, and content so your agents actually focus on clients (instead of Google Docs).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Signs You’re Ready for AI</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You spend more time chasing leads than closing them</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Your “content plan” is posting listings and praying for likes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ve thought about hiring help, but hate the idea of babysitting a VA</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’re ready to scale but don’t want to double your workload</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Real?world example:</strong> A seasoned team leader used the Accelerator to automate lead follow?up and content posting. The result? Hours freed up every week that she now reinvests into negotiations, open houses, and building client relationships. These are activities that actually grow her bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-this-matters-before-joining-e-xp-realty\">Why This Matters Before Joining eXp Realty</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The bottom line: You <em>can</em> buy Mike Sherrard’s AI Agent Accelerator, but if you want it for free, you’ll need to be part of his sponsor line at eXp Realty.

It blends heritage-inspired branding with modern technology to help agents close more deals and provide elevated client experiences.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, imagine listing a 200-acre ranch. Instead of juggling multiple platforms, you’d log into your Land and Ranch dashboard to generate a detailed property map through Land ID Pro, create a custom listing website in minutes, and syndicate that listing to Land.com, Mansion Global, and Acres with a single entry. You could then use the one-click presentation builder to deliver a professional pitch, complete with automated seller reports that keep your clients informed without extra effort. This streamlined approach not only saves time but positions you as the go-to expert in your market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-you-qualify-for-e-xp-land-and-ranch\">How Do You Qualify for eXp Land and Ranch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can qualify for the eXp Land and Ranch Division through production, credentials, or certification. This ensures all members bring proven expertise or quickly earn it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Production Route:</strong> 3 closed sides of 5+ acres within the last 24 months</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Credential Route:</strong> Accredited Land Consultant (ALC) or Equestrian Property Specialist (EPS)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Certification Route:</strong> Complete the eXp Land and Ranch Certification course within 30 days of joining</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re a residential agent new to land sales, you could join through certification. Within a month, you’d complete the self-paced online course, then immediately leverage division tools to market your first 20-acre listing with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-does-membership-cost\">What Does Membership Cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The eXp Land and Ranch Division offers <a href=\"https://join.landandranch.exprealty.com/faq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two membership options</a> so agents can choose based on their goals and budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\"><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Charter Membership ($2,995/year):</strong> Includes full listing marketing, Land Broker MLS dashboard, unlimited Land ID mapping, listing syndication, and 3 concurrent Land.com listings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brand Membership ($995/year):</strong> Includes logo use, design templates, masterminds, and events, plus the on-demand presentation tool.

Meanwhile, a Brand Member might focus on building credibility and networking through division masterminds while using the professional templates to establish a polished presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-tools-and-marketing-do-you-get-with-e-xp-land-and-ranch\">What Tools and Marketing Do You Get with eXp Land and Ranch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Charter Members receive an advanced marketing suite designed to maximize listing visibility and impress clients from day one.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Listing Exposure:</strong> Syndication across Land.com, Farms USA, Acres, Mansion Global, Moody’s, and more</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mapping Tech:</strong> Unlimited Land ID Pro maps for clear property visuals</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Custom Branding:</strong> Brochures, catalogs, signage, and social media graphics</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canva Enterprise:</strong> Pre-built templates for mailers, postcards, and presentations</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Automated Seller Reports:</strong> Provide seamless updates without extra effort</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Single Listing Websites:</strong> Create instant professional property sites</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you land a $2 million recreational ranch listing, you could map boundaries with Land ID Pro, build a sleek single-property website, and syndicate it across premium platforms in minutes—positioning you as a top-tier expert to both the seller and potential buyers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-community-growth-opportunities-exist\">What Community &amp; Growth Opportunities Exist?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Land and Ranch Division provides ongoing collaboration, training, and networking so you’re never on your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>4x Monthly Masterminds:</strong> Learn from experienced land and ranch agents</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Workshops &amp; Events:</strong> Local and national opportunities to build relationships</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Certification Courses:</strong> Gain credibility and sharpen your expertise</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Exclusive Agent Directory:</strong> Tap into a powerful referral and networking hub</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, an agent in Texas could connect through a mastermind with a colleague in Montana who specializes in hunting ranches, leading to a referral deal that neither would have landed solo. This shared network turns expertise into new opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-this-topic-matters-before-you-join-e-xp-realty\">Why This Topic Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line: Selling land and ranch properties isn’t the same as selling homes. It’s a credibility game. You need specialized marketing, mapping tools, and strategies that your average brokerage can’t even spell, let alone provide. And while you can cobble together resources on your own, why would you? When you join Karrie and Doug’s Smart Agent Alliance at eXp Realty, you get access to purchase everything the eXp Land and Ranch Division offers, plus you get our value and what we’re constantly building, all for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp\" alt=\"Black and white photo of Karrie Hill and Doug Smart with the bold gold SAA logo overlaid, representing the leadership of Smart Agent Alliance.\" class=\"wp-image-267426 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>At Smart Agent Alliance, we don’t just provide the connection to plug you into the Land and Ranch Division.
