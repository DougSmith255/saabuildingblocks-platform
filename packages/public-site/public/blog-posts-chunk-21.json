From <strong>licensing fees to marketing yourself</strong>, it may feel like everyone’s got a hand in your wallet.</p>\n<p>But don’t worry, this isn’t about scaring you off. It’s about <strong>prepping you</strong> so those real estate agent expenses don’t sneak up and <strong>burn a hole</strong> through your bank account. After all, launching a real estate career is like starting your own business, and that means start-up costs and ongoing expenses.</p>\n<p>The good news? Many of these are <strong>tax-deductible</strong>, and with the right planning, you’ll be ready to handle them like a pro. Let’s break it all down so you can hit the ground running without feeling overwhelmed. Here’s your handy dandy index:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#watch-the-you-tube-version\">Licensing Costs</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#brokerage-fees\">Brokerage fees?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#professional-fees\">Professional Fees?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#operational-expenses\">Operational Expenses</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#listing-expenses\">Listing Expenses?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#lead-generation-expenses\">Lead Generation Expenses</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#professional-development-fees\">Professional Development Fees?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#financial-planning\">Financial Planning</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"watch-the-you-tube-version\">Licensing Costs</h2>\n<p>To kick off your real estate career, you’ll need to navigate a series of licensing costs, and while they may seem small at first glance, they can stack up quickly. First up, you’ve got the <strong>pre-licensing course</strong>, which typically costs between $150 and $1,000, depending on your state and whether you opt for online or in-person classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Study guides</strong>, which make prepping for your exam easier, can add another $35 to your expenses. Then there’s the <strong>state exam fee</strong> itself, usually around $100 to $400, plus the <strong>background check</strong>, which runs anywhere from $22 to $100 depending on where you live.</p>\n<p>Once you pass the exam, you’ll need to pay a fee to obtain your <strong>real estate license</strong>—anywhere from $150 to $350. But don’t forget, some states also require <strong>post-licensing education</strong> to keep your license active, which can range from $50 to $450.</p>\n<p>All in all, getting your real estate license will likely cost you between $500 and $1,500, depending on your state and choices. For more exact information on the licensing process and fees in your state check out <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/how-to-get-a-real-estate-license/\">more information here</a>. https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/how-to-get-a-real-estate-license/</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-fees\">Brokerage fees</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247680\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Brokerage-Fees.webp\" alt=\"Real Estate Agent Expenses, Brokerage Fees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"179\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Brokerage-Fees.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Brokerage-Fees-300x54.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Brokerage-Fees-768x137.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Once you have your real estate license, the next step is joining a brokerage, and with that comes a whole new set of real estate agent expenses. First off, there’s the <strong>commission split</strong>—this is where the brokerage takes a percentage of your earnings. Splits can vary widely, mostly in the range from a generous 90/10 split to a heftier 50/50, which can make a big difference in your take-home pay.</p>\n<p>On top of that, many brokerages charge an <strong>initial start-up fee</strong>, usually around $50 &#8211; $150, just for joining. After that, you’ll likely be paying <strong>monthly fees or annual fees. </strong>These range from about $85 to thousands per month, which covers the brokerage’s ongoing support, office space, tech platforms, tools, and resources.</p>\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s <strong>Errors &#038; Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance</strong>, a necessary protection against potential lawsuits, which typically costs anywhere from $60 per transaction to $2200 upfront before you have any deals. So, yes, this is a big one to know the exact amount.</p>\n<p>All these real estate agent expenses vary wildly between brokerages. To get more thorough information on brokerage splits and fees check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\"><strong>brokerage comparison tool here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Overall, these expenses can add up quickly, so it’s essential to compare brokerages and to know what brokerages offer in return, whether it’s resources, training, or marketing materials.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"professional-fees\">Professional Fees</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247684\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Fees.webp\" alt=\"Professional Fees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"195\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Fees.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Fees-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Fees-768x150.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve joined a brokerage, there are some additional professional fees to consider. One of the most common is the cost of joining the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>National Association of REALTORS®</strong></a> (NAR), which can be a great boost to your career.</p>\n<p>While not always mandatory, NAR membership gives you access to valuable tools like marketing guidance, tech solutions, exclusive discounts, and a network of over a million associates. Membership also offers you the prestigious REALTOR® designation, which can elevate your credibility. <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/membership/dues-information\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NAR dues</a> are around $150 per year. https://www.nar.realtor/membership/dues-information</p>\n<p><strong>State and local real estate boards</strong> may also charge a few hundred dollars or more annually for membership. On top of that, there are MLS (Multiple Listing Service) fees, which run about $150 to $500 per year. The MLS is essential for real estate agents as it gives you access to property listings, making it a must-have for anyone serious about their real estate career.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"operational-expenses\">Operational Expenses</h2>\n<p>When it comes to operational real estate agent expenses, things can add up quickly in your real estate career. One of the first expenses you’ll need to consider is <strong>building and maintaining a website</strong>, which can cost anywhere from $180 to $3,480 per year, depending on how fancy you want it to be.</p>\n<p>Other website options can be to use a personal website that your brokerage offers. For example, eXp Realty agents get a personal IDX website (more than a page on the brokerage website) that is part of their $85 monthly fee. That helps keep costs down!</p>\n<p>Then there are the <strong>business cards</strong>—around $500 a year for a memorable design that leaves an impression. Plus, <strong>promotional items</strong> like branded pens or magnets can keep your name in front of clients, helping you stay top of mind for future business.</p>\n<p>Also don’t forget about <strong>travel expenses</strong>, especially since real estate agents are always on the move. Expect to pay at least $2,000 a year on gas, car maintenance, insurance, and maybe even the occasional plane ticket if you’re attending national conferences.</p>\n<p>If you work from home, <strong>office expenses</strong> like internet, paper, and pens will add up to about $2,400 per year. Plus, you’ll need a reliable printer and scanner to keep your documents in check.</p>\n<p><strong>Health insurance</strong> is another biggie, costing roughly $450 per month for individuals and more for families. However, again, large brokerages like eXp Realty that leverage their size and influence have access to much lower-cost healthcare options for individuals and families. More about that <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-healthcare/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>And there are more operational real estate agent expenses. There are <strong>transaction coordinators</strong> to help with deal paperwork likely costing from $300 &#8211; $700 per transaction.</p>\n<p>Even small costs like <strong>lockbox keys</strong> (about $15-$25 a month), and all-important <strong>client lunches and gifts</strong> ($25-$150 a month) can make a dent. But remember, these tools and services keep your real estate business running smoothly, so it’s smart to budget for them upfront!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"listing-expenses\">Listing Expenses</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247682\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Listinng-Expenses.webp\" alt=\"Real Estate Agent Expenses, Listing Expenses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"223\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Listinng-Expenses.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Listinng-Expenses-300x67.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Listinng-Expenses-768x171.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>When it comes to listing expenses, they can stack up quickly, but they’re key to making your properties stand out and attracting potential buyers.</p>\n<p>First off, you’ll want to invest in <strong>real estate signs</strong>, which typically run between $50 and $150 per sign. You’ll also need <strong>lockboxes</strong> for your listings, usually around $100 each, to keep the property secure during showings.</p>\n<p>Hiring <strong>professional photographers or videographers</strong> is crucial to showcase the home’s best features online, with costs ranging from $100 to $500 per listing.</p>\n<p>You also may need <strong>2D or 3D floor plans, single property websites, drone shots, and 3D walkthroughs</strong>. Expect to tack on $500 to $1500 more here. And if you’re listing luxury properties, expect these costs to be closer to $5000.</p>\n<p><strong>Printing listing flyers</strong> adds another $50 &#8211; $300 to your expenses while promoting the listing through social media ads or classifieds could cost anywhere from $100 to thousands.</p>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>open houses</strong>, you’ll need to budget for snacks, drinks, and other refreshments to make the experience inviting, typically costing $50 to $250 per open house.</p>\n<p>If you really want to go the extra mile, and if it’s economically feasible, consider <strong>staging</strong> the home, which can lead to faster sales and higher prices, making it a worthy investment.</p>\n<p>All in all, listing-related expenses for each listing can range from $1,000 to multi-thousands annually, depending on how you choose to market the property. It’s these extra touches that can make a big difference in how quickly and successfully you close deals. And, that’s what you want &#8211; a payday to refund you for all your expenses!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lead-generation-expenses\">Lead Generation Expenses</h2>\n<p>When it comes to generating leads, real estate agent expenses can add up, but they’re crucial for growing your business. <strong>Advertising</strong> your services is one of the biggest investments, with most agent’s costs ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 annually or more!</p>\n<p>In your first year, marketing will likely take a big chunk of your budget. You’ll either pay for it upfront or invest your <strong>blood, sweat, and tears</strong> with low-cost methods such as door-knocking, calling FSBOs, or creating organic social media accounts and YouTube channels. 🙂</p>\n<p>On top your actual advertising, you’ll need a process to keep your leads and communication with them all organized. You’ll need a <strong>CRM</strong> &#8211; customer relationship management tool &#8211; to accomplish that. CRMS can cost $1000, $3000, or even more. But some brokerages, like eXp Realty, include top-end CRMs as part of their agent fee package without additional agent expense.</p>\n<p>While advertising significantly adds to your real estate agent expenses, it increases your visibility and provides prospects for you to convert to deal-closing clients!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"professional-development-fees\">Professional Development Fees</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247683\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Developmennt.webp\" alt=\"Professional Development\" width=\"1000\" height=\"174\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Developmennt.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Developmennt-300x52.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Developmennt-768x134.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Staying sharp in real estate means ongoing learning, and that comes with a price tag. <strong>Continuing education</strong> (CE) courses are essential for agents who want to keep their licenses and thrive in a competitive market. On average, agents spend around $200 per year on these courses, but costs vary by state.</p>\n<p>Beyond the basic requirements, agents often take classes to<strong> earn certifications and gain designations</strong> to boost their expertise and credibility. These investments enhance skills and open doors to new client opportunities and specialized niches. Costs range from hundreds to thousands.</p>\n<p><strong>Networking events</strong> are another real estate agent expense, allowing agents to meet new people, exchange ideas, and grow their businesses. Sometimes, these events require travel and accommodations, adding to the cost, but the payoff in connections and potential clients makes it worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Hosting your own events can also be a smart investment, giving you a platform to stand out and expand your network in the real estate world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"financial-planning\">Financial Planning</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re a real estate agent, financial planning is a must, especially since most agents are classified as independent contractors. This means you’re responsible for covering self-employment taxes, which include both Medicare and Social Security—the costs that a typical employer would handle.</p>\n<p>But don’t worry; there are perks too! Many work-related expenses, like gas, office supplies, and even marketing costs, can be claimed as tax deductions. Keeping track of these deductions helps offset the self-employment tax burden.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to budget for quarterly tax payments to avoid a hefty bill at the end of the year. Agents should also work closely with a tax professional who can ensure they’re taking advantage of all possible deductions, making tax time smoother and more financially beneficial.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Becoming a real estate agent comes with exciting opportunities, but it carries significant real estate agent expenses. From licensing and brokerage fees to ongoing expenses, agents face a variety of costs that can add up quickly.</p>\n<p>However, you can manage these expenses effectively while building a successful and lucrative career. Understanding these financial commitments upfront will help you stay ahead and thrive in the competitive world of real estate.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>By partnering with us, you’ll be joining the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\">ONLY profitable public brokerage in the past 5 years</a> that agents rank as the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>With Smart Agent Alliance</strong> you’ll enjoy personalized day-to-day concierge care plus assets like customizable agent presentations, business automation, production checklists, customizable social media posts, and <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/team-benefits/\">so much more.</a></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3.webp\" alt=\"Group photo of Wolf Pack team members at eXp CON\" class=\"wp-image-3493\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3.webp 960w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-768x432.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n<p>As a member of our team, you’ll also enjoy exclusive access to the <strong>Wolf Pack weekly webinars</strong>, <strong>Social Agent Academy</strong> for social media training, the <strong>Wolf Pack Hub</strong> for easy onboarding, Investor Army for investing and flipping houses training, and more.</p>\n<p>Don’t miss out on this amazing opportunity to maximize your earnings and build a thriving agent business. <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-our-exp-realty-sponsor-team/\">Join eXp Realty today</a> and <strong>experience unparalleled support</strong> from our FREE team.</p>\n<p>Not quite convinced?

These brokerages operate with fundamentally different approaches when it comes to commission, support, technology, and overall agent experience. Whether you&#8217;re trying to keep more of your money or build prestige in luxury markets, here&#8217;s how they stack up.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-corcoran\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Corcoran</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a 100/0 commission split, meaning agents keep every dollar of commission they earn. There are no franchise or royalty fees, and the only out-of-pocket costs are a flat $700 per year and per-transaction fees between $150 and $250. This ultra-simple structure is ideal for agents who want to calculate their take-home pay without mental gymnastics.</p>\n<p>Corcoran takes the opposite approach. Commission splits range from 50/50 to 70/30, and agents also pay a 6% franchise fee on every transaction. There’s no production cap, which means that even top-producing agents continue to split commissions and pay fees indefinitely. Transaction fees are wrapped into that structure, but Corcoran also charges separate costs for E&#038;O insurance—often on the higher end. Monthly office fees vary by location, adding more inconsistency to an agent’s cost structure.</p>\n<p>If your goal is maximizing profit, Fathom offers clarity and savings. Corcoran, while built for luxury branding, definitely takes a bigger cut.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is strictly transactional. There’s no revenue share, no stock awards, and no pathway to earn retirement or willable income through the company. You earn what you sell—full stop. That’s great if you’re focused on commissions today but offers no passive income potential for the future.</p>\n<p>Corcoran operates similarly. There are no residual income paths, equity awards, or wealth-building opportunities beyond traditional sales. Like Fathom, you sell, you earn, and that’s where the income stops.</p>\n<p>Neither brokerage supports agents in building long-term financial freedom. If you want your income to grow beyond what you personally produce, you’ll have to look elsewhere.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty keeps things lean, which means there’s no formal in-house training and no around-the-clock agent support. This model works well for seasoned agents who are already operating independently, but may leave newer agents feeling a little stranded.</p>\n<p>Corcoran does provide training, but the quality and structure vary significantly depending on the local office. There&#8217;s no universal system, and like Fathom, there’s no 24/7 support, so you’re dependent on office availability and manager responsiveness. It’s workable if you&#8217;re in a high-performing office, but it&#8217;s inconsistent across the board.</p>\n<p>For both brokerages, self-motivation is a must. You won’t find structured national programs or on-demand mentorship platforms here.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a tech platform that covers the basics—transaction management, client communication, and compliance tools. It gets the job done, but it’s not designed to impress. If you want cutting-edge marketing automation, AI-powered CRMs, or integrated branding systems, you’ll need to add your own tools or join a team that provides them.</p>\n<p>Corcoran, with its luxury real estate focus, does provide high-end marketing resources. Presentation matters here, and the materials reflect that. Their technology isn’t necessarily more advanced, but it’s geared toward the polished look and feel expected in luxury markets. Still, it’s not a cloud-based platform and doesn’t offer the kind of flexibility or innovation you’ll find with more modern models.</p>\n<p>In short, Fathom gives you the freedom to build with lean tools. Corcoran provides stronger branding, but the tech behind it may not evolve as fast as today’s most scalable brokerages.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty has earned a solid 4.6-star rating from hundreds of agent reviews on Glassdoor. Agents regularly praise the simplicity of the model and the ability to keep more of their income. Common frustrations center around the lack of training and the self-reliance required to succeed.</p>\n<p>Corcoran comes in slightly behind with a 4.4-star rating. Agents often speak highly of the company’s luxury brand and marketing support but also note concerns about high fees and commission splits that chip away at earnings. Again, office-by-office experiences vary, and that inconsistency shows up in the reviews.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages have their loyal fans—but the financial structure at Fathom tends to generate more consistent praise.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-corcoran\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Corcoran</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a match for agents who want to maximize their commission, eliminate unnecessary fees, and run their business without extra layers. It’s not for agents who need hand-holding or crave the cachet of a big-name brand, but it’s built for independence and profitability.</p>\n<p>Corcoran is a fit for agents committed to the luxury space who value strong marketing assets and a prestigious brand. However, you’ll pay for that brand recognition through lower splits and higher fees—and you won’t get much in return when it comes to wealth-building options or passive income.</p>\n<p>If you’re just comparing these two, the question becomes: do you want to be branded or be profitable?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>This isn’t just another brokerage comparison — it’s a real look at how your paycheck, support, and business tools will be affected by your choice. Whether you&#8217;re drawn to the simplicity of flat fees or the prestige of a well-known name, here&#8217;s how Fathom Realty and Better Homes &#038; Gardens Real Estate compare where it counts.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-better-homes-gardens\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Better Homes &#038; Gardens</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>At Fathom Realty, the 100/0 commission split means what it says — agents keep every cent of their commission. There are no franchise or royalty fees taking a cut, and agents enjoy complete freedom from production caps. The only recurring costs are a flat $700 annual fee and a per-transaction fee between $150 and $250. This predictable, no-frills model has been one of Fathom’s biggest selling points for agents who want to simplify their finances and scale their business without penalty.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens, in contrast, operates under a traditional split model that ranges from 60/40 to 80/20. The company also takes a 6% franchise or royalty fee, which further trims the agent’s net income. There’s no cap in place, so even top producers continue paying the split. Monthly fees vary based on office and region, and while transaction fees are baked into the royalty structure, there are additional costs like E&#038;O insurance. Overall, it’s a higher-cost model, even though it comes with the familiarity of a household brand.</p>\n<p>If your goal is to keep more of what you earn, Fathom&#8217;s lean model clearly gives you more breathing room.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty doesn’t offer revenue share, equity awards, or retirement paths — it’s a commission-only setup. What you close is what you make, and that’s where it ends. It’s clean and simple, but there’s no added value for long-term wealth building.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens follows the same philosophy. Agents earn their commission and have no access to recurring income, revenue sharing, or other wealth-building incentives. So while the company supports sales activity with its branding, it doesn’t reward agents beyond the deals they personally close.</p>\n<p>Neither model offers additional income streams, which may work fine for those focused only on transactions, but won’t meet the needs of agents thinking about scaling or exiting the business someday.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty has earned a reputation for being agent-friendly, but it doesn’t provide structured training or 24/7 support. That approach works well for confident, experienced agents who already know the ropes, but may feel limiting to newer agents seeking mentorship or coaching. The low overhead and minimal intrusion are perks for self-starters, but not ideal for someone who needs handholding.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens does offer training, but it varies by office. Some locations are known for robust support and onboarding, while others offer the bare minimum. Like Fathom, there’s no 24/7 support, so agents are largely dependent on local managers and office culture for help.</p>\n<p>In both models, success depends heavily on your own initiative and your specific office environment.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty gives agents access to basic tech tools like transaction management systems and CRMs. It’s not flashy, but it gets the job done. There’s no massive tech suite, and agents who want advanced lead generation or marketing platforms will need to build that stack independently or join a team that offers it.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens leans into technology and branding more heavily. With the backing of a recognizable brand, agents can access strong marketing resources and CRM systems designed to support high visibility and lead follow-up. These tools can be especially useful for agents who are less tech-savvy or who want to plug into a ready-made system.</p>\n<p>Fathom provides the essentials with freedom to customize. Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers a more fully built platform, but it comes at a higher cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty currently holds a 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor, with hundreds of agents praising the simple commission structure, predictable fees, and freedom to operate independently. Agents regularly mention financial clarity as one of the biggest advantages.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens earns a slightly lower rating of 4.3 stars from fewer total reviews. Agents tend to appreciate the branding, marketing tools, and name recognition, but also mention the pain of ongoing fees and limited income options as recurring downsides.</p>\n<p>If agent reviews are any indicator, the satisfaction difference often comes down to expectations — whether agents prioritize branding or bottom-line income.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-better-homes-gardens\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Better Homes &#038; Gardens</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is the choice for agents who want full commission, fixed fees, and minimal brokerage interference. It’s best suited for those who value autonomy and know how to manage their business without needing constant support or tech-heavy tools.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens makes more sense for agents who want the credibility of a national brand and access to advanced marketing resources. But it comes with the trade-off of lower commission retention and more ongoing costs, with no cap in sight.</p>\n<p>Neither brokerage supports passive income, equity, or long-term wealth strategies. If that’s what you’re looking for, you may want to explore an alternative that gives you both earning power and financial growth opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.<strong></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>In this comparison between LPT vs REMAX, we&#8217;ll dive into the key aspects that agents should consider, including commission structures, fees, income opportunities, and agent support.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-re-max\">Final Thoughts on LPT  vs REMAX</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers commission splits ranging from 80/20 to 100/0. This flexibility allows agents to maximize their earnings. There are no franchise or royalty fees, making it more cost-effective for agents who want to keep a higher percentage of their commissions. The production cap at LPT Realty is $15K, meaning agents keep 100% of their commissions after hitting this cap. Monthly fees vary, with options as low as $500/year plus $0 or $89/month, or $149/month, depending on the agent&#8217;s choice. Transaction fees are $195 before reaching the cap.</p>\n<p>In contrast, RE/MAX has commission splits that start at 60/40 and go up to 95/5. However, RE/MAX charges a 5% franchise/royalty fee, which reduces agents&#8217; take-home earnings. The production cap is significantly higher at $23K, and monthly fees range from $300 to $2,500, making RE/MAX a more costly option for agents. Transaction fees are included in the royalty fees, which may provide some predictability, but the higher fees overall can reduce the agent’s bottom line.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out by offering a revenue share program, allowing agents to earn additional income through team building and recruitment. This offers an extra stream of passive income beyond commissions. LPT also provides retirement income and willable income paths, offering agents a long-term financial security option.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX, on the other hand, does not offer a revenue share program, nor does it provide retirement or willable income paths. Agents at RE/MAX rely solely on their commission-based income, which may limit long-term financial planning options.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not have a specified formal training program but offers 24/7 agent support, ensuring that agents have access to help when needed. This level of support is crucial for agents who prefer having consistent access to resources and guidance.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX provides access to its Online University for training, which is a structured learning platform. However, it lacks 24/7 support, which may be a downside for agents who need more immediate assistance, particularly in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides agents with access to a variety of technology tools and platforms designed to enhance their marketing and client management efforts. The cloud-based model allows for flexibility and efficiency, especially for agents on the go.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX also invests in technology, offering agents tools for lead management, marketing, and transaction handling. However, the higher cost structure may make these tools less attractive compared to LPT Realty’s more affordable options.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a 4.3-star rating on Glassdoor, with 37 reviews. Agents appreciate the flexibility in commission splits, lower fees, and income opportunities through the revenue share model.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX holds a 4.2-star rating from 3.3K reviews. While the brand recognition and vast network are major benefits, agents often mention the high fees as a downside.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-re-max\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs REMAX</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers more flexibility with commission splits, lower fees, and additional income streams through its revenue share program, retirement income path, and willable income options. This makes it a great choice for agents who want to maximize their income potential while keeping their costs low.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX, on the other hand, is a well-established brand with strong name recognition and a large network, but its higher fees and lack of additional income opportunities may make it less attractive for agents focused on long-term financial growth.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

    "content": "<p>In this comparison between LPT  vs Compass, we’ll dive into the key differences that real estate agents should consider when choosing the best brokerage to meet their career and income goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on LPT Realty vs Compass</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers competitive commission splits ranging from 80/20 to 100/0, with no franchise or royalty fees. Agents benefit from a $15K production cap, after which they retain 100% of their commission. LPT Realty’s monthly fees are flexible, starting at $0 and going up to $149, depending on the agent’s package. Transaction fees are set at $195 before the cap, making it a cost-efficient option for agents looking to maximize earnings.</p>\n<p>Compass, in contrast, has commission splits that range from 60/40 to 92.5/7.5, however, Compassagents only sometimes have a production cap, meaning agents continue to split commissions indefinitely. Monthly fees start at $145 and can vary depending on the office, and transaction fees may go up to 4%, making it a more costly option.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a revenue share model, allowing agents to generate passive income by recruiting others to the brokerage. This program creates additional long-term income opportunities for agents. LPT Realty also offers a retirement income path and willable income, ensuring agents can plan for their financial future beyond commissions.</p>\n<p>Compass does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income, or willable income paths. Agents at Compass are limited to commission-based income, which can restrict long-term financial growth and wealth-building potential.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides agents with solid training resources and 24/7 agent support, ensuring agents have the tools they need to succeed at any time. The availability of support round-the-clock is a key advantage for agents who need immediate assistance.</p>\n<p>Compass has a more traditional training approach through the Compass Academy, offering good resources but without 24/7 agent support. This can be a downside for agents who require ongoing support, especially during non-standard working hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides advanced technology platforms that support CRM, marketing, and transaction management, giving agents the flexibility and efficiency needed to thrive in modern real estate. These tools are cloud-based, allowing agents to access their work anytime, anywhere.</p>\n<p>Compass is known for its proprietary technology, which is geared toward marketing and luxury markets. While it is highly regarded, the higher costs associated with accessing these tools may deter some agents from looking for a more affordable option.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 37 reviews, with agents praising the revenue share program and lower fees. The smaller number of reviews reflects LPT Realty’s newer entry into the market, but feedback is generally positive.</p>\n<p>Compass holds a 3.7-star rating from 2.4K reviews. While its prestige and technology are appreciated, many agents express concerns over the higher fees and the lack of income opportunities beyond commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on LPT Realty vs Compass</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out with its lower fees, income opportunities through revenue sharing, and long-term financial benefits like retirement and willable income paths. It is a great option for agents looking for cost-effective solutions and passive income streams.</p>\n<p>Compass is a prestigious brokerage with strong branding and luxury market expertise, but its higher costs and lack of passive income options may not appeal to agents focused on maximizing earnings and planning for the future.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

    "content": "<p>Choosing between Real (also known as Real Broker) and Compass is a crucial decision for any real estate agent looking to build a successful career. This article will break down the key differences in commission splits, fees, training, technology, and overall agent satisfaction to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-broker-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Compass</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> offers highly competitive commission splits ranging from 85/15 to 100/0, with no franchise or royalty fees, making it a top choice for agents wanting to maximize their earnings. Real Broker also has a production cap of $12K, meaning that agents keep 100% of their commissions once they hit this cap. The brokerage also rewards top agents with a $24K bonus, making it appealing for high producers. Monthly fees are $750 per year, with no transaction fees until agents reach the cap.</p>\n<p><strong>Compass</strong>, on the other hand, offers commission splits from 60/40 to 92.5/7.5, but agents must pay a 4% marketing fee, which can make a significant cut into their overall earnings. Additionally, Compass only sometimes offers a production cap or top agent bonuses, which can be a drawback for high-earning agents. Monthly fees vary by office but typically start at $145.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>One of the standout features of <strong>Real Broker</strong> is its revenue share model, which allows agents to earn income by recruiting other agents. This provides an additional income stream that goes beyond commissions. Real Broker also offers retirement income and willable income paths for agents who meet the time qualifications, giving them long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>Compass</strong> does not offer a revenue share program or additional income opportunities like retirement income or willable income. Agents at Compass are primarily dependent on their commission earnings, which may limit long-term wealth-building potential.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker excels in providing consistent, high-quality training. Agents have access to 30+ live training sessions each week, covering everything from lead generation to transaction management. Additionally, Real offers 24/7 agent support, ensuring that agents can get help whenever they need it.</p>\n<p><strong>Compass</strong> provides training through its Compass Academy, which is widely recognized for its quality. However, unlike Real Broker, Compass does not offer 24/7 support, which could be a limitation for agents working in fast-paced markets or requiring immediate assistance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Both brokerages offer cutting-edge technology to help agents succeed. <strong>Real Broker</strong> uses cloud-based systems that integrate CRM tools, marketing platforms, and transaction management, making it highly efficient for tech-savvy agents. <strong>Compass</strong>, on the other hand, is known for its proprietary technology platform, which includes marketing, listing tools, and data-driven insights to help agents stand out. However, Compass’s tech offerings come at a higher cost, which could impact an agent’s profitability.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> has an impressive Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews. Agents at Real frequently praise the transparent fee structure, income opportunities, and the level of training and support offered.</p>\n<p><strong>Compass</strong> holds a 3.7-star rating from 2.4K reviews on Glassdoor. While Compass agents appreciate the brand’s marketing power and tech tools, complaints often arise around the high fees and limited income opportunities beyond commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-broker-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Compass</h3>\n<p>For agents looking for a brokerage with lower fees, more income streams, and robust support, <strong>Real Broker</strong> is the clear winner. The revenue share model, bonus opportunities, and comprehensive training make it a solid choice for agents who want to grow their careers while maximizing their earnings.</p>\n<p>Compass offers a well-known brand and excellent technology, but higher fees and fewer income opportunities might make it less attractive for agents focused on long-term wealth-building.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

They’ll be looking for <strong>warmth, responsiveness, and professionalism</strong>.  Be conscious of your tone and approach. Show that you’re listening actively, that you’re invested in understanding their needs, and that you’re approachable.</p>\n<p>Ok, let’s get into realtor questions you should be prepared to answer during your buyer agent interview with a home buyer.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-background\">Agent Background</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agent-Background.webp\" alt=\"realtor questions on Agent Background\" class=\"wp-image-246864\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agent-Background.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agent-Background-300x71.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Agent-Background-768x180.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Expect homebuyers to quiz you about your roots. How long have you been around the area? How well do you know the local quirks? If you’ve raised a family locally – yes, drop that into your conversation because families often discover hidden gems that others never looked for. Your deep local knowledge is a massive plus, so don’t hold back sharing it!</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Amp up your connection to the community. Talk up your knowledge of the local hotspots, weather patterns, and even those tricky traffic patterns. These insights directly affect your client’s happiness in a new location. Your local expertise is a significant part of your value proposition—don’t be shy about sharing it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"education-experience-and-professional-background\">Education, Experience &#038; Professional Background</h2>\n<p>Be ready for questions about your educational journey, agent experience, and professional affiliations. Where’d you study? How long have you been an agent? Are you a full-time agent? What qualifications do you hold? While some might seem off-topic, they show your commitment to learning and professional growth. Everyone wants a “smart” agent.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Chat about or show your education, ongoing training, and any certifications. The more you show dedication to staying informed and skilled, the more trust you&#8217;ll build with potential clients. Real estate’s always evolving, and clients love an agent who keeps up!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"saving-dough-for-homebuyers\">Saving Dough for Homebuyers</h2>\n<p>One of the most impactful realtor question you’ll face is: How much money can you save me? Clients are becoming more aware that a savvy buyer agent can save them significant sums, sometimes even more than your fees.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Come prepared with data. If you’ve consistently saved your clients money, share those stats proudly. While you can’t guarantee future savings, having a track record speaks volumes about your negotiation skills and real estate market savvy. This is where you demonstrate that hiring you is an investment that pays for itself.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"steller-reviews\">Steller Reviews</h2>\n<p>Even if they don’t ask outright, be the first to mention your reviews. What have past clients said about you?</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Point them to your Google Business Profile or Zillow where your reviews live. Proud of a solid five-star streak? Shout it out! Good reviews not only reflect your ability to deliver but also show you care about your reputation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"winning-in-multiple-offers\">Winning in Multiple Offers</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Winning-in-Multiple-Offers.webp\" alt=\"Winning in Multiple Offers\" class=\"wp-image-246867\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Winning-in-Multiple-Offers.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Winning-in-Multiple-Offers-300x75.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Winning-in-Multiple-Offers-768x191.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>In a hot market, your clients will want to know your success rate in multiple-offer scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Share your stats. High success rates here can really set you apart as a skilled competitor. While no agent can win every time, being able to show a strong track record of success will instill confidence in your potential clients.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"advising-against-risky-purchases\">Advising Against Risky Purchases</h2>\n<p>Homebuyers often get excited when they find great homes, sometimes overlooking potential pitfalls. They’ll value a buyer agent who’s not afraid to flag risks. In fact, many surveys have stated that this is the biggest value people perceive that buyer agents bring to the table.  So, if they don’t ask, bring up your record.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>If possible, whip out a spreadsheet of stats to verify how many times you’ve steered a buyer away from a potential bad or risky deal.  Concrete examples go a long way.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-value\">Brokerage Value</h2>\n<p>While your personal value as a real estate agent is paramount, the strength of your brokerage is another area of interest. Homebuyers want to know that they’re backed by the best.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Be prepared to discuss what makes your brokerage stand out. If you’re with eXp Realty, for example, highlight the brokerage’s leadership in helping more families than any other brokerage in the United States and also your access to exclusive off-market properties.</p>\n<p>Explain how being part of a leading brokerage benefits them from tools and resources to reputation and network leverage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees-and-discounts\">Fees and Discounts</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fees-and-Discounts.webp\" alt=\"realtor questions on Fees and Discounts\" class=\"wp-image-246865\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fees-and-Discounts.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fees-and-Discounts-300x76.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Fees-and-Discounts-768x194.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Expect that homebuyers will be curious about your fees and if there’s room to negotiate. It’s a fair realtor question, as they’re trying to get the most bang for their buck. But start by explaining how discount fees generally mean less than full service.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Be transparent and consistent about your fees and any discounts you offer.  Even if you don’t do discounts, explain how you work to get them the best deal on their home. That saves them money too! Also, if your clients have benefited from some fee commission reduction like perhaps you buy all your clients a home warranty, highlight that.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"service-fee-menus\">Service Fee Menus</h2>\n<p>Along with discussing your fees with clients, consider offering fee menus.  For example, consider charging one fee for full service and a lower fee for limited service.  Doing that alone will help your potential clients understand the difference between the two and they’ll love having a choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Tailoring options to their needs shows you’re focused on providing value, not just making a sale.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-real-deal-on-commissions\">The Real Deal on Commissions</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"231\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/The-Real-Deal-on-Commissions.webp\" alt=\"realtor questions on The Real Deal on Commissions\" class=\"wp-image-246866\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/The-Real-Deal-on-Commissions.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/The-Real-Deal-on-Commissions-300x69.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/The-Real-Deal-on-Commissions-768x177.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>And, again, on the topic of agent fees, do NOT miss the opportunity to explain what your actual take-home pay is for your earned fee.  It’s common for buyers to think agents pocket the full commission. This is your chance to set the record straight!</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Break down your real costs—how much goes to the brokerage, team, expenses, etc. This transparency helps them more deeply appreciate your services and understand the value they’re getting. Don’t forget to recap that you don’t get paid at all unless you find them their dream home and secure it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wrapping-it-up\">Wrapping it Up</h2>\n<p>Armed with this knowledge, you’re set to impress and win clients.

Here’s how:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fee-transparency\">Fee Transparency</h3>\n<p>Now that buyer agents must have written<a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts/written-buyer-agreements-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> buyer agreements</a> in the form of a <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts/homebuyers-what-the-nar-settlement-means\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home buyer</a> representation agreement that lays out their fees, real estate buyer agent fees will be clear. With agents needing this agreement before showing a home, home buyers will have upfront knowledge about the fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"negotiation-power\">Negotiation Power</h3>\n<p>Instead of the fee being set by the home seller and offered to any agent through the MLS, buyers now can negotiate directly with their agent based on the value that their agent will provide.</p>\n<p>These changes are steps in the right direction, ensuring the process is more transparent and fair.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"misconceptions-about-buyer-agents\">Misconceptions About Buyer Agents</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents.webp\" alt=\"Misconceptions About Buyer Agents\" class=\"wp-image-246783\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents-300x78.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents-768x199.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>These new rules come at a time when many home buyers and sellers are undervaluing the role of buyer agents. They’re getting excited about the <strong>possibility of lower fees</strong>. After all, with home searches just a click away, it’s easy for them to think, “<strong>I’m doing all the work</strong> finding the home; the agent just opens the door and takes a big cut!”</p>\n<p>I understand where they’re coming from. Before becoming an agent, I thought the same way. And now that I’m in the business, I know that some agents really don’t bring enough value to justify their fees, so sometimes I was right in my assumptions.</p>\n<p>But here’s the reality: <strong>the old system didn’t help</strong>. Whether an agent was exceptional or just average, they got paid the same from the seller. But now, with these new NAR changes, buyer agents have to communicate the value they bring and justify their costs. The field just got a lot tougher, and that’s a good thing—fewer mediocre agents, more value for buyers!</p>\n<p>Before becoming an agent, part of the reason I undervalued buyer agents was because I didn’t realize a few key things: that Buyer Agents Work on Contingency; that the “big number” on the closing statement and on their TV screens when they watch Million Dollar Listing isn’t the agent’s take-home pay; or that Buyer agents handle about 100 tasks for their clients behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>These are all things you buyer agents out there now need to explain to home buyers. They really don’t know. Need some help with that? Check out our blog and videos about real estate buyer agent consultations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyers-avoiding-buyer-agents\">Buyers Avoiding Buyer Agents</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"217\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyers-Avoiding-Buyer-Agents.webp\" alt=\"Buyers Avoiding Buyer Agents\" class=\"wp-image-246781\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyers-Avoiding-Buyer-Agents.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyers-Avoiding-Buyer-Agents-300x65.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyers-Avoiding-Buyer-Agents-768x167.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>So, in my neck of the woods, and perhaps yours too, you may have heard that while these new NAR changes are a big win for home buyers, they’re also having an <strong>unintended consequence.</strong> More buyers are now approaching listing agents directly, skipping buyer agents altogether.</p>\n<p>These buyers likely don’t realize what they’re missing out on. A good buyer agent can save them money, reduce their risk, and give them a much better chance of landing their dream home, especially in a competitive market.</p>\n<p>And here’s the kicker—many of these <strong>DIY buyers think they’re saving money</strong>, but if things are playing out where you are the same way they are for me, listing agents are adding a fee in their contract with the seller to compensate them for doing some legwork that buyer agents would typically handle.</p>\n<p>Well, that’s fair, but DIY home buyers don’t realize that they aren’t saving what they think they are.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"history-of-buyer-agency\">History of Buyer Agency</h2>\n<p>So, how did we get here? With all the recent lawsuits, you likely know that real estate agent fees have hovered around <strong>5% or 6% for a long time</strong>. How long? Since the <strong>1940s</strong>.</p>\n<p>But there was a big difference back then. Back in the day, the full 5% or 6% went to the listing agent. That&#8217;s right—the listing agent pocketed the whole commission because there were no buyer agents.</p>\n<p>By the <strong>1960s</strong>, listing agents realized they could sell more homes by offering a portion of their commission to other agents who would bring in lots of potential buyers. These agents, known as sub-agents, worked under the listing agent’s wing, splitting the commission in exchange for helping to market and sell the home.</p>\n<p>Less money for the listing agent, sure, but also less work because the sub-agents handled a lot of the tasks. The trade-off made sense for listing agents.</p>\n<p>This arrangement worked for a while, but it came with a major flaw. The sub-agents, while helping buyers, were actually representing the seller’s interests, not the buyers’. Even if a sub-agent never met the seller, their legal responsibility was to the seller.</p>\n<p>This meant that buyers were often under the false impression that the agent showing them homes was working in their best interest when, in reality, they weren’t.</p>\n<p>In fact, a <strong>1983 FTC study</strong> revealed that 72% of buyers were under the false impression that the agents showing them homes were representing them.</p>\n<p>By the early <strong>1990s</strong>, this system started to crack under pressure. More and more buyers, realizing they had been left out in the cold without proper representation, began filing lawsuits.</p>\n<p>In response to these lawsuits, the real estate industry came up with a solution—buyer agency. This new model allowed buyer agents to have a fiduciary duty to the buyer, meaning they could truly represent the buyer’s best interests. And, listing agents continued to split their commission with these hardworking buyer agents who helped them sell the house.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-sellers-will-continue-to-pay-buyer-agents\">Why Sellers Will Continue to Pay Buyer Agents</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents.webp\" alt=\"Why Sellers Will Continue to Pay Buyer Agents\" class=\"wp-image-246785\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents-768x151.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>With these new NAR changes, life has become a bit easier for home sellers too. Now, sellers sign listing agreements where they’re only obligated to pay their own agent&#8217;s fees. This makes sense, right?</p>\n<p>But sellers can still agree, through negotiation with a home buyer, to cover the buyer agent’s fees too. The big question is, will they? I believe the answer is, of course they will! And here’s why:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Attracting Buyer Agents: Buyer agency started because home buyers needed real representation, but it also benefited sellers by attracting more buyers. That fundamental reason hasn’t changed.</li>\n<li>Maximizing Buyers&#8217; Budgets: When buyers put down larger down payments, they often qualify for lower interest rates, which saves them money and enables them to afford a more expensive home. Sellers want buyers to have more purchasing power, right?</li>\n<li>Tax Benefits: If sellers pay the buyer agent’s fees, it lowers their profit on paper, which can positively affect their taxes. So, there’s a financial incentive for sellers to consider covering those costs.</li>\n<li>Focus on Net Profit: At the day’s end, sellers only care about their net profit. It doesn’t matter whether they pay the buyer agent’s fee or not—it’s all about how much they walk away with after the sale.</li>\n<li>All this debate about whether sellers will pay is overblown. Even those who claim they’ll never pay a buyer agent’s fee will change their tune when they see they can net more money from the sale by doing so.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-the-new-rules-lead-to-lower-prices\">Will the New Rules Lead to Lower Prices?</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"204\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices.webp\" alt=\"Will the New NAR Changes Lead to Lower Prices\" class=\"wp-image-246786\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices-300x61.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices-768x157.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>First off, they’ve already gone down. Th president of the National Association of Realtors said, the “Average commission in the U.S. fell to a new low of 4.94% in 2020.” So, fees already dropped since online searches became the norm after 2008.</p>\n<p>Will fees drop even more? My guess—not by much.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"impact-for-listing-agents\">Impact for Listing Agents</h3>\n<p>For listing agents, nothing has changed, except they can pick up a higher pay by charging the seller for unrepresented buyers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"full-service-buyer-agents-fees\">Full-Service Buyer Agents’ Fees</h3>\n<p>As for full-service buyer agents, we’ll probably keep charging 2.5-3% because, on average, we spend twice as much time per client as listing agents do. If we aren’t paid enough, it just doesn’t make sense for us to stay in the game.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"discount-agents\">Discount Agents</h3>\n<p>Buyers who want to save a buck can always go for discount agents, but you should let them know they’re likely sacrificing service quality. Evidence of that? Discount agents have been around for over a decade, and they haven’t taken over the industry. “Discount” is code for less service.</p>\n<p>However, the rise of unrepresented buyers might lower overall fees slightly, but not by 2.5-3%. Those unrepresented buyers will once again, just like back in the days when the listing agent made the whole 5 – 6%, be paying for the listing agent to cover some of the work a buyer agent would normally do.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if we soon see a wave of lawsuits from unrepresented buyers who didn’t fully understand the “cost” of going it alone or the risks of being taken advantage of. Sounds a lot like the 1990s all over again.</p>\n<p>So, while I don’t foresee a significant drop in agent fees, these changes are a huge win for home buyers. They now have a clearer understanding of what they’re paying for, and buyer agents need to step up and clearly explain the value they bring to the table.</p>\n<p>Agents who can’t or won’t do that will likely find themselves out of the business, which is ultimately great for the reputation of the real estate profession. So hang in there, communicate your value, and get ready for your greatest success ever.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>The recent NAR changes have increased transparency in real estate agent fees, requiring written agreements and giving buyers more negotiation power.</p>\n<p>While this could lead to misconceptions about the value of buyer agents, it also pushes agents to better communicate their worth.</p>\n<p>Despite some buyers attempting to bypass agents, the changes are unlikely to lead to a significant drop in overall fees. Ultimately, the new rules benefit both buyers and the industry by encouraging higher standards among real estate professionals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>By partnering with us, you’ll be joining the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\">ONLY profitable public brokerage in the past 5 years</a> that agents rank as the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>With Smart Agent Alliance</strong> you’ll enjoy personalized day-to-day concierge care plus assets like customizable agent presentations, business automation, production checklists, customizable social media posts, and <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/team-benefits/\">so much more.</a></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3.webp\" alt=\"Group photo of Wolf Pack team members at eXp CON\" class=\"wp-image-3493\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3.webp 960w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-768x432.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n<p>As a member of our team, you’ll also enjoy exclusive access to the <strong>Wolf Pack weekly webinars</strong>, <strong>Social Agent Academy</strong> for social media training, the <strong>Wolf Pack Hub</strong> for easy onboarding, Investor Army for investing and flipping houses training, and more.</p>\n<p>Don’t miss out on this amazing opportunity to maximize your earnings and build a thriving real estate business. <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-our-exp-realty-sponsor-team/\">Join eXp Realty today</a> and <strong>experience unparalleled support</strong> from our FREE team.</p>\n<p>Not quite convinced?

With agents needing this agreement before showing a home, home buyers will have upfront knowledge about the fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-home-buyers-negotiate-for-a-lower-real-estate-buyer-agent-commission\">Can home buyers negotiate for a lower real estate buyer agent commission?</h3>\n<p>Yes, instead of the fee being set by the home seller and offered to any agent through the MLS, buyers now can negotiate directly with their agent based on the value that their agent will provide.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-real-estate-buyer-agents-accept-lower-fees\">Will real estate buyer agents accept lower fees?</h3>\n<p>We think the answer is yes for brand-new agents who do not yet have a strong value proposition and no for seasoned agents who know what value they bring to the table.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-home-buyers-buy-a-home-without-a-real-estate-buyer-agent\">Can home buyers buy a home without a real estate buyer agent?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but there is still likely a hidden fee for being unrepresented as the listing agent needs to perform more work. Plus, home buyers without an agent miss out on buyer agent perks like saving home buyers money, reducing their risk, and giving them a much better chance of landing their dream home, especially in a competitive market.ng what they think they are.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-the-new-rules-lead-to-lower-prices-2\">Will the New Rules Lead to Lower Prices?</h3>\n<p>Probably not much. Total average fees will be lower due to home buyers taking on the extra risk of buying a home without an agent and maybe also from brand new agents giving discounts until they know their worth. But, it’s not likely full-service agents will drop their fees.</p>\n<p>Home buyers can also choose discount agents, but they always could. Discounters haven’t taken over the market because discount means less service and generally less optimal outcomes too.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-should-real-estate-buyer-agents-do-to-survive\">What should real estate buyer agents do to survive?</h3>\n<p>Easy, <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/sales-marketing/agents-lean-in-on-value-and-their-clients-see-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agents Lean in on Value—and Their Clients See It</a>.

Why? They&#8217;ve caught wind that they don&#8217;t need a buyer agent to check out a house.</p>\n<p>So, what happens when these eager buyers hit up listing agents to open doors for them? Well, the cool listing agents are staying in their lane and saying, “Nope, I don’t cover buyer agent duties. Go find one.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>But some listing agents, where it’s legal, are scooping up these buyers with <strong>dual agency</strong> representation – you know that type of representation that really results in no representation but costs the same as a buyer agent. And, other listing agents are encouraging buyers to sign a simple <strong>unrepresented buyer agreement</strong> just so the buyers can take a peek inside the house.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-1-Listing-Agent-Contact-Advantage.webp\" alt=\"real estate buyer agent problems are unbalanced now, displayed through a close-up of a balance\" class=\"wp-image-246491 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-1-Listing-Agent-Contact-Advantage.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-1-Listing-Agent-Contact-Advantage-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Think buyers will quickly sign these agreements without thinking much about it?  Yes, of course, they will. They want into the house and signing seems like no biggie! Except it is.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why. Many listing agents charge their sellers an extra fee to handle unrepresented buyers – they aren’t going to do buyer agent work for free.</p>\n<p>If a buyer signs an unrepresented buyer agreement, then sees the light and hires a buyer agent to work the deal, depending on the listing agreement, that buyer might get slapped with both unrepresented buyer fees and buyer agent fees. Talk about a financial mess for buyers!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-can-you-do\">What can you do?</h3>\n<p><strong>Make some noise</strong> about this. Tell everyone that these unrepresented buyers are still coughing up cash through hidden fees tucked away in contracts they can’t see. They’re not saving what they think and they’re giving up a lot of buyer agent advantages.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-2-listing-agent-open-house-edge\">Buyer Agent Problem #2: Listing Agent Open House Edge</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, direct phone calls from home buyers to listing agents are not the only way listing agents get the upper hand with the new NAR changes. Their open houses pull in loads of potential buyers too.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s another trap for buyers.</strong> Unscrupulous or naïve open house agents (who are not always the listing agents) may lead visitors into thinking they need to sign a representation agreement right then and there to tour the place.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-2-Listing-Agent-Open-House-Edge.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246486 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-2-Listing-Agent-Open-House-Edge.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-2-Listing-Agent-Open-House-Edge-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Not true! Since the new rules don&#8217;t apply to seller agents (or any agent sitting at an open house), no one needs to sign anything to stroll through an open house.</p>\n<p>But if a house hunter wants the lowdown on some insider info about the property, an open house agent might say, &#8220;Sorry, can’t share that unless you sign up with me.&#8221;  Good for home buyers? <strong>No way!</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Home buyers should take the time to find the best agent to represent them. Signing on the spot doesn’t do that.  But will people sign? Of course, they will because that’s the quickest way to get answers to their burning property questions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it\">How to handle it?</h3>\n<p>Spread the word loud and clear: signing on the fly is risky business. Urge potential buyers to take their time to really get what value an agent brings before they sign anything.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-3-zillow-and-similar-lead-providers\">Buyer Agent Problem #3: Zillow &#038; Similar Lead Providers</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Now onto Zillow, which due to the NAR changes, has started requiring callers interested in a property to sign a <strong>7-day non-exclusive touring agreement</strong>. Potential buyers might shrug and sign, thinking, “It’s just a week.”</p>\n<p>But here’s the twist: if they fall for the property and need to act fast, they&#8217;re stuck with that agent to make the quick offer. And let’s face it, not all agents are created equal—especially not the ones paying for those leads.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-3-Zillow-Similar-Lead-Providers.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246487 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-3-Zillow-Similar-Lead-Providers.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-3-Zillow-Similar-Lead-Providers-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-1\">How to handle it?</h3>\n<p>Well, there’s not much you can do except to teach the huge importance of buyers taking time to choose the best agent for them based on their due diligence, not on some random agent assigned to open the door.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-4-getting-signed-agreements\">Buyer Agent Problem #4: Getting Signed Agreements</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s cut to the chase on this one—we’ve already chatted about it in blogs and videos about <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/buyer-agent-presentation/\"><strong>Real Estate Buyer Agent Consultations</strong></a><strong> and “10 Realtor Questions to Expect from Home Buyers”.</strong></p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that this new NAR change hurdle is lower than you may think.  All you need to do is break down what you do, the unique value you bring, your commission fees, and how your buyer agent compensation works.</p>\n<p>What’s the best way to do that? Whip up an awesome buyer presentation. Spell it all out. Remember, lots of people think buyer agents are just door openers.

After all, you have already taught them so much!</p>\n<p>In California, the maximum term for a buyer representation agreement is three months. Kudos to you agents for getting clients into contracts in three months, but let’s be real—it often doesn’t happen that fast.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>We’re not fans of this new time cap, even though we let buyers cancel contracts anytime. Why? It’s tough when I’m pouring value into a client’s lap for them to face me and cancel our agreement. But if a contract just runs out of time, it’s easier for people to just do nothing and decide to go it alone. In that case, they don’t even need to talk to me.</p>\n<p>This leaves us in a <strong>bit of a bind</strong>: spill too much wisdom and you might just convince clients they can handle it solo; hold back, and they might think you’re not worth keeping around.</p>\n<p>Of course, we agents know unrepresented buyers are significantly disadvantaged by not working with a buyer agent and, worse, by getting played by savvy listing agents. However, buyers don’t seem to understand the disadvantages of having no representation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-2\">How to handle it? </h3>\n<p>Navigating this tightrope of upfront value, well that’s tricky. Honestly, I don’t think there’s any magic fix. Buckle up, it’s gonna be a wild ride.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-6-signed-unrepresented-buyer-agreement\">Buyer Agent Problem #6: Signed Unrepresented Buyer Agreement</h2>\n<p>I<strong>magine this:</strong> a buyer comes to you all excited, saying they’ve signed an unrepresented buyer agreement but now they’ve seen the light and want your help to buy the house. Awesome, right? Not so fast.</p>\n<p>If they’ve already signed off with a listing agent, there’s a good chance that the agent will pocket their “extra” unrepresented buyer fee, even if they don’t finish the work. That means your buyer could be on the hook for more fees than they expect.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-3\">How to handle it? </h3>\n<p><strong>Educate, educate, educate</strong> so that buyers don’t get in this pickle to start with. But, if it does happen to you, let your buyer know the problem, and then contact the listing agent to determine the level of the problem.</p>\n<p>Consider requesting that the listing agent amend their listing agreement. Or, you might consider lowering your own compensation if it means securing the best outcome for your client. In that case, hopefully, the listing agent already put in some hours that you would have done had the buyer contacted you originally.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-7-more-record-keeping\">Buyer Agent Problem #7: More Record Keeping</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Oh, the joys of NAR changes and paperwork! But seriously, keeping <strong>meticulous records</strong> is now more crucial than ever for buyer agents. When you’re juggling non-exclusive representation agreements, you’ve got to keep tabs on who saw what property and when.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-7-More-Record-Keeping.webp\" alt=\"real estate buyer agent problems displayed by a man leaning on a stack of paperwork.\" class=\"wp-image-246489 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-7-More-Record-Keeping.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-7-More-Record-Keeping-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>This isn’t just busywork—it’s about clarity and keeping things above board in your representation dealings.</p>\n<p>And here’s <strong>another wrinkle</strong>: if your clients end up being charged different fees—maybe because a seller’s only covering part of your fee—you better document every detail. Why? This rigorous paperwork is your best defense against any accusations of violating fair housing laws.</p>\n<p>The best new plan: Keep detailed records and stay consistent with your fees, no matter the client or situation. It’s your safeguard in this tricky business.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-8-getting-paid\">Buyer Agent Problem #8: Getting Paid</h2>\n<p>First off, nail down a buyer representation contract that spells out your fee. And don’t sweat it if a buyer’s worried about affording your fee on their own.</p>\n<p>Most sellers will still see the <strong>value in footing the bill</strong> for buyer agents because it brings more buyers and potentially higher offers. Even stubborn sellers will change their tune when they see a net offer that outshines the rest.</p>\n<p>Second, make sure your offers include <strong>clear language</strong> about the seller covering the buyer agent fee. Something like, “Seller agrees to pay the buyer $x amount to meet buyer’s obligation to pay buyer agent”. </p>\n<p>Make sure you get this right for your state’s procedures.  Get it wrong and you may not get paid!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-9-need-to-warn-do-it-yourselfers\">Buyer Agent Problem #9: Need to Warn Do-It-Yourselfers</h2>\n<p>Here’s a hot take on these NAR changes: lots of buyers think they don’t need a buyer agent anymore—either because they believe agents <strong>just open doors</strong>, or they think they can’t afford one.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246490 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>It’s on you to set the record straight. Explain the 100 tasks you handle as a buyer agent and how, more often than not, sellers will cover your fee.</p>\n<p>And don’t forget to clue buyers in on the pitfalls of going it solo. Remember those sneaky unrepresented buyer fees we talked about? That’s just the <strong>tip of the iceberg</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Let’s say there are two identical offers on a house—one with a buyer agent, and one without. Guess which one has the edge? Yep, the one with the agent. Why? Listing agents know that deals with buyer agents are more likely to cross the finish line smoothly because they are experts in keeping deals on track after an offer is accepted.</p>\n<p>You know, tons of calls to inspectors, lenders, escrow officers, the listing agent, everything it takes to make sure all the parts are coming together.  It’s your job now to explain that.</p>\n<p>And while you’re at it, highlight how the continuous relationships agents have with one another often result in better outcomes and less risky deals for buyers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>The new NAR changes are definitely reshaping our industry, and how agents and their brokerages behave.

Buyers are signing because they want to get into the house. Buyers don’t know there is likely a cost to having no representation. That fee, negotiated between the listing agent and the seller, is hidden and it may be substantial. Buyers will often have worse outcomes, pay more and take on more risk, without a good buyer agent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-home-buyers-need-to-sign-agreements-to-see-an-open-house\">Do home buyers need to sign agreements to see an open house?</h3>\n<p>No, but open houses do give listing agents an edge to get naive home buyers to sign agreements like dual agency (where allowed), unrepresented buyer, or a single property buyer (when the open house agent is not the listing agent). Home buyers need to interview agents to find the best one. They should never sign a contract on the fly as there may be hidden fees and it’s not in their best interest. Open house visitors can see the home without signing any agreement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if-a-buyer-requests-a-home-showing-through-zillow-must-they-sign-a-buyer-representation-agreement\">If a buyer requests a home showing through Zillow must they sign a buyer representation agreement?</h3>\n<p>Yes, in the form of a 7-day touring agreement. Problem &#8211; if the buyer wants to immediately make an offer, they are stuck with the randomly assigned agent who is paying Zillow to get these leads. That agent may easily not be the best match to get the best outcome for the buyer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-home-sellers-keep-paying-for-buyer-agents\">Will home sellers keep paying for buyer agents?</h3>\n<p>Yes, most likely. In the end, sellers just want the highest net price for their home. It’s simple math.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if-a-home-buyer-signs-an-unrepresented-buyer-agreement-can-they-still-hire-a-buyer-agent\">If a home buyer signs an unrepresented buyer agreement, can they still hire a buyer agent?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but it may be costly because there is usually a hidden fee associated with these unrepresented buyer agreements and that fee may or may not end when the buyer decides they want their own buyer representation. Buyers can ask their agent to get the low down and work the issue with the listing agent for a potentially better client outcome.</p>\n",
