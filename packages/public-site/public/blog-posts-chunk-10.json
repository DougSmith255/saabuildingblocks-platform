Let’s break down the two types of teams you’ll hear about at eXp.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sponsor-teams-bonus-support-if-you-pick-the-right-one\">Sponsor Teams: Bonus Support (If You Pick the Right One)</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Sponsor teams—like Smart Agent Alliance—are made up of agents who offer tools, mentorship, community, and training to their downline. When you name a Smart Agent Alliance founder as your eXp sponsor, you’re plugging into proven systems that would normally cost thousands (and sometimes still underdeliver). The value? All included—no extra charge.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp\" alt=\"Team SAA - Smart Agent Alliance\" class=\"wp-image-267426 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>But here’s the catch: <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/basics\">most eXp sponsors aren’t part of a structured sponsor team</a>. And they’re not required to offer you anything beyond their name for your join eXp application. So when you hear “meet our team” or see someone pushing an eXp sponsor team, make sure they’re actually offering value and not just a Canva logo and vibes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"organized-teams-where-structure-meets-splits\">Organized Teams: Where Structure Meets Splits</h3>\n<p>This blog? It’s about the other kind—organized real estate teams at eXp. These are formal business setups with a team leader, one or more real estate teammates, and a signed agreement that lays out how the whole thing runs. Think of it like a mini brokerage within the brokerage.</p>\n<p>You get defined commission splits, assigned roles, and a system built to make the business more scalable, without the overhead of a traditional office. eXp stays hands-off when it comes to internal team drama, so make sure your contracts are airtight and your expectations are crystal clear.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-you-join-a-sponsor-team-and-an-organized-team-at-e-xp\">Can You Join a Sponsor Team <em>and</em> an Organized Team at eXp?</h3>\n<p>And yes, you can absolutely be part of a sponsor team and also join an organized team. They serve two totally different purposes, and finding both <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/find-yours\">your ideal sponsor</a> and a great organized team can give you the best of both worlds: support, mentorship, structure, and scalability.</p>\n<p>Now that we’ve sorted that out, let’s talk about what real estate teams actually are—and how they work.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-a-real-estate-team-really\">What Is a Real Estate Team, Really?</h2>\n<p>At its core, a real estate team is a group of agents and support staff working under a structured system to move deals faster and serve clients better. These teams are like well-oiled machines—everyone’s got a job, and no one’s stuck doing five roles badly.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"287\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Can-You-Join-a-Sponsor-Team-and-an-Organized-Team-at-eXp.webp\" alt=\"Can You Join a Sponsor Team and an Organized Team at eXp\" class=\"wp-image-267431 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Can-You-Join-a-Sponsor-Team-and-an-Organized-Team-at-eXp.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Can-You-Join-a-Sponsor-Team-and-an-Organized-Team-at-eXp-300x172.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>You’ll often find buyer specialists who focus solely on guiding clients through the purchase process while listing agents handle pricing strategy, sometimes using tools like <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/curbio\">Curbio</a> to get properties market-ready without upfront costs.  Transaction coordinators keep the paperwork flowing with help from <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/skyslope\">Skyslope</a>e, and admin pros handle everything from scheduling to CRM upkeep. This specialization helps every team member operate in their zone of genius, and helps clients feel like they’re getting VIP treatment at every stage.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>But not every real estate agent team runs like a corporate org chart. Some real estate teams operate more casually: they generate leads together, share marketing resources, and cheer each other on, while each agent still runs their own deals from start to finish.</p>\n<p>No matter the style, the goal’s the same: streamline the chaos, deliver top-notch service, and grow faster than you could solo.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exploring-e-xp-realty-team-structures-which-one-fits-your-business\">Exploring eXp Realty Team Structures: Which One Fits Your Business?</h2>\n<p>So, you&#8217;ve got your eye on the eXp Realty team model—but which version? Just like real estate clients, not all teams come with the same needs, paperwork, or personalities. Luckily, eXp Realty gives you options.</p>\n<p>There are four main eXp team structures, and each comes with its own rules around production requirements, commission splits, and team size. Whether you&#8217;re rolling solo with your spouse or scaling to empire status, eXp has a setup for you.</p>\n<p>Let’s break it down—without the boring parts.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-domestic-teams-just-the-two-of-you-and-one-cap\">1. Domestic Teams: Just the Two of You (and One Cap)</h3>\n<p>Domestic Teams are exactly what they sound like—a two-agent power couple setup. You and your spouse (or domestic partner) team up, share one $16K cap, and work your market like the duo you are. All you need is proof you file taxes together or a marriage certificate.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This real estate team structure is ideal for agents who share more than just a CRM. You’re working together day in and day out, making joint decisions, splitting the load, and probably negotiating who’s doing dinner between showings. Efficiency and flexibility with built-in support—plus, no need for complex team paperwork.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Domestic-Teams-Just-the-Two-of-You-and-One-Cap.webp\" alt=\"Domestic Teams Just the Two of You and One Cap\" class=\"wp-image-267432 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Domestic-Teams-Just-the-Two-of-You-and-One-Cap.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Domestic-Teams-Just-the-Two-of-You-and-One-Cap-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-self-organized-teams-casual-vibes-solid-collaboration\">2. Self-Organized Teams: Casual Vibes, Solid Collaboration</h3>\n<p>A Self-Organized Team at eXp is basically the “we’re all friends who hustle together” model. There are no official cap reduction or team lead requirements here—just agents working together in a loosely defined structure. You can share leads, systems, and memes. You’re independent but cooperative.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>There’s also no limit to how big your self-organized team can get, and as long as there’s no formal team agreement, you can even have multiple side teams or informal alliances. This structure is perfect for entrepreneurial agents who want teamwork without a hierarchy.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Self-Organized-Teams-Casual-Vibes-Solid-Collaboration.webp\" alt=\"Self-Organized Teams Casual Vibes, Solid Collaboration\" class=\"wp-image-267434 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Self-Organized-Teams-Casual-Vibes-Solid-Collaboration.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Self-Organized-Teams-Casual-Vibes-Solid-Collaboration-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-standard-teams-the-startup-squad-with-structure\">3. Standard Teams: The Startup Squad with Structure</h3>\n<p>Want reduced caps for your real estate teammates and a bit more structure? Time to talk Standard Teams.</p>\n<p>To qualify, your team leader must have closed 30 transactions or $6 million in volume over the last 12 months. Team members can choose a reduced $8K cap, but that comes with a catch: the team lead must receive at least 25% of each transaction.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This setup creates clear roles, workflows, and revenue-sharing that help newer agents get mentorship while more experienced ones scale faster. It’s a smart option for those looking to run a lean, productive, and profitable eXp Realty team—without needing $40M in production (yet) and while still keeping more commission than with so-called <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/100-percent\">100% commission brokerages.</a></p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"501\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Standard-Teams-The-Startup-Squad-with-Structure.webp\" alt=\"Standard Teams The Startup Squad with Structure\" class=\"wp-image-267428 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Standard-Teams-The-Startup-Squad-with-Structure.webp 501w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Standard-Teams-The-Startup-Squad-with-Structure-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-mega-icon-teams-for-the-agents-who-run-things\">4. Mega Icon Teams: For the Agents Who Run Things</h3>\n<p>Mega Icon Teams are the top-tier model at eXp. These teams are for leaders who’ve closed $40 million or 175 transactions in the last 12 months, and have at least 10 team members who would’ve capped individually. Some may tap into resources like <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/exp-commercial\">eXp Commercial</a> too.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The benefits? Huge. Team members can opt into a $4K cap (yes, really), but they’ll need to give the team lead that same minimum of 25% per transaction. There’s no cap on how large these teams can grow, and because they’re producing at volume, they often have access to more tools, higher-level training, and massive scalability potential.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mega-Icon-Teams-For-the-Agents-Who-Run-Things.webp\" alt=\"Mega Icon Teams For the Agents Who Run Things\" class=\"wp-image-267433 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mega-Icon-Teams-For-the-Agents-Who-Run-Things.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mega-Icon-Teams-For-the-Agents-Who-Run-Things-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Think of Mega Icon Teams as the top eXp Realty teams—elite squads designed for domination, expansion, and long-term growth through revenue share.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-quick-comparison-of-e-xp-realty-team-types\">A Quick Comparison of eXp Realty Team Types</h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Team Type</td>\n<td>Cap Options</td>\n<td>Min Requirements</td>\n<td>Team Size</td>\n<td>Team Lead Cut (if cap reduced)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Domestic</td>\n<td>Shared $16K cap</td>\n<td>Must be spouses or partners</td>\n<td>2 max</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Self-Organized</td>\n<td>$16K per agent</td>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>Unlimited</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard</td>\n<td>$8K optional cap</td>\n<td>$6M or 30 deals/year</td>\n<td>Min 2, no max</td>\n<td>25% minimum per deal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mega Icon</td>\n<td>$4K optional cap</td>\n<td>$40M or 175 deals/year</td>\n<td>Min 11+, no max</td>\n<td>25% minimum per deal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-e-xp-realty-commission-splits-work-on-a-team\">How Do eXp Realty Commission Splits Work on a Team?</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about everyone’s favorite topic: getting paid. Specifically, how much of it you actually <em>keep</em> when you’re on an eXp Realty team—because if you think your team leader takes a cut <em>and</em> that’s the end of it… Surprise! eXp wants their piece too.</p>\n<p>Here’s the deal: being part of an organized real estate team often means you’re splitting commission <em>twice</em>—once with your team leader, and then again with eXp. It&#8217;s not a scam—it’s just how commission splits for teams are structured. Knowing how the dollars flow can save you from some serious math shock on payday.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-commissions-are-calculated-on-e-xp-teams\">How Commissions Are Calculated on eXp Teams</h3>\n<p><strong>Here’s the general order of operations:</strong></p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Any outside referrals owed to other brokers come off the top.</li>\n<li>The remaining gross commission is split between the team leader and team member based on your agreement (commonly 50/50).</li>\n<li>Then, eXp’s company dollar (the 20% split up to your cap) and transaction fees are deducted from <em>each agent’s share</em> individually.</li>\n<li>Fees like the broker review fee, capped transaction fee, and risk management fee are per transaction—not per agent—so they’re usually split 50/50.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-example-10-000-gross-commission-deal\">Real Example: $10,000 Gross Commission Deal</h3>\n<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>50/50 split between the team leader and the team member</li>\n<li>Team leader is capped</li>\n<li>Team member is not capped</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s say your team just closed a deal for $10,000. High five.<br />Now the fun begins&#8230;</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>$5,000 goes to the Team Leader</li>\n<li>$5,000 goes to the Team Member</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Easy, right? Not so fast.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"team-leaders-cut-capped\">Team Leader’s Cut (Capped):</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start with $5,000</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of capped transaction fee ($250) ? $5,000 &#8211; $125 = $4,875</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of broker review fee ($25) ? $4,875 &#8211; $12.50 = $4,862.50</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of risk management fee ($60) ? $4,862.50 &#8211; $30 = $4,832.50 net</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"team-members-cut-uncapped\">Team Member’s Cut (Uncapped):</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start with $5,000</li>\n<li>Subtract 20% to eXp ($1,000) ? $4,000</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of broker review fee ($12.50) ? $3,987.50</li>\n<li>Subtract 50% of the risk management fee ($30) ? $3,957.50 net</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wait-so-im-paying-both\">Wait—So I&#8217;m Paying <em>Both</em>?</h3>\n<p>Yep. When you&#8217;re on an eXp Realty team, your team leader gets their agreed-upon cut (at least 25% if you&#8217;re on a reduced cap like in Standard or Mega Icon Teams), <em>and</em> eXp still collects their usual 20% company dollar and transaction fees from you directly.</p>\n<p>So even if you’re handing 25% of your commission to your team lead, you’re still on the hook for your personal split with eXp.</p>\n<p>And all those little fees? Broker review, risk management, capped transaction fees—they get split between you and the team leader per transaction, not per team. So don’t be surprised when you both see those line items pop up on your statement. Welcome to the wild world of real estate team structures. It’s not complicated once you see how it flows, but it <em>is</em> important to understand before your first payday surprise.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-team-members-icon-at-e-xp-realty\">Can Team Members ICON at eXp Realty?</h2>\n<p>Ah, the ICON Agent <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eXp-Realty-US-ICON-Program-Overview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ICON Agent Award</a>—a shiny badge of honor and a nice chunk of your cap back in stock. But if you’re part of an eXp Realty team, especially an organized one, you’re probably wondering: <em>Do team members still qualify for ICON?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes, but it depends on your cap.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"204\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eXp-Realty-Stock-Awards-and-ICON-Status-ICON-status-photo.webp\" alt=\"eXp Realty Stock Awards and ICON Status ICON status photo\" class=\"wp-image-249966\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eXp-Realty-Stock-Awards-and-ICON-Status-ICON-status-photo.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eXp-Realty-Stock-Awards-and-ICON-Status-ICON-status-photo-300x61.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/eXp-Realty-Stock-Awards-and-ICON-Status-ICON-status-photo-768x157.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p><strong>Here’s how it works across the different eXp team structures:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Domestic Teams: Only one ICON award is available per team since you&#8217;re sharing one $16K cap. So if you&#8217;re in a two-person Domestic Team, you’ll have to fight it out (or, you know, just agree on it like adults).</li>\n<li>Self-Organized Teams: Every agent is on a full $16K cap here, which means every team member can qualify for ICON independently. No restrictions. Just hustle close deals, and get rewarded.</li>\n<li>Standard Teams: Team members can still ICON—but only if they opt to stay on the full $16K cap instead of taking the reduced $8K cap option. If they go with the lower cap, they won’t be eligible. So it’s basically a choice: save money upfront or play the long game for ICON benefits.</li>\n<li>Mega Icon Teams: Same rules as Standard Teams, just scaled up. Members can ICON if they stay on the full $16K cap. If they choose the reduced $4K cap, ICON’s off the table.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So yes, eXp Realty team members can achieve <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/icon-agent\">ICON status</a>—but only if they’re willing to commit to the full cap. If you’re running the numbers, just know that ICON status comes with some serious perks, including up to $16,000 in stock incentives. Worth considering if you’re aiming high.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"can-you-add-team-members-in-another-state\">Can You Add Team Members in Another State?</h2>\n<p>So your eXp Realty team is up and running, and now you’re thinking bigger—like <em>multi-state bigger</em>. Maybe you’ve got a rockstar agent in Texas, but your team’s based in California. Can they join your team?</p>\n<p>Yes, team members in another state <em>can</em> be added to your organized eXp Realty team—but don’t skip over the fine print.</p>\n<p>Here’s the deal: crossing state lines means crossing into a jungle of licensing laws, broker supervision rules, and set-up logistics. Every state has its real estate regulatory circus, and eXp needs to make sure your team is compliant no matter where it operates.</p>\n<p>Before adding that out-of-state agent, you’ll need to loop in teamservices@exprealty.net or hop into the Onboarding &#038; Agent Support Lobby. They’ll walk you through how to handle the different state requirements, paperwork, and onboarding steps.</p>\n<p><strong>One exception?</strong> Domestic Teams. If you’re in a Domestic Team and want to add another state, both partners must be licensed in that same state. Otherwise, it won’t fly—and commissions can’t be processed without referrals.</p>\n<p>So yes, you can build a cross-state real estate team at eXp. Just make sure you’re not winging it, because “winging it” doesn’t go over well with state real estate commissions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-e-xp-realty-collaboration-and-smart-agent-alliance-can-help-you-grow\">How eXp Realty Collaboration and Smart Agent Alliance Can Help You Grow</h2>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re thinking about starting a team, joining one, or just trying to understand how eXp Realty team structures work without falling into a black hole of confusion, this guide should have cleared things up.</p>\n<p>What makes eXp stand out is how it empowers agents to collaborate, scale, and build smart real estate businesses.

Reduced-cap team members (like those on Standard or Mega Icon Teams) are not eligible for ICON status. Domestic teams can share the cap but only one can earn ICON.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What is the difference between a sponsor team and an organized team at eXp?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Sponsor teams offer optional coaching, tools, and community support to agents in their downline. Organized teams are formal business entities with commission splits, agreements, and roles under eXp’s official team structure.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Can I be in both a sponsor team and an organized team?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Yes. Sponsor teams and organized teams serve different purposes. You can be in both at the same time and benefit from the support and structure each offers.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">How are commissions split on eXp Realty teams?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">The commission is first split between the team leader and team member (often 25 – 50% going to the team leader). Then, eXp deducts its 20% company split (unless the agent has capped) and applicable transaction fees from each agent’s share individually.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Are transaction fees split or charged per person?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Fees like the broker review and risk management fee are charged per transaction, not per agent. That means they are typically split between team members.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Can eXp Realty teams include agents from different states?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Yes, but compliance rules vary by state. You’ll need to coordinate with eXp&#8217;s Team Services to ensure all legal requirements are met. Domestic team members must both be licensed in the same state.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

But at eXp Realty, Making It Rain isn’t about drama, glitter, or tossing cash in the air—it’s about finally having a digital marketing strategy that works harder than your overpriced postcards ever did. Think <em>less gimmick, more Google clicks</em>.</p>\n<p>Making It Rain eXp Realty is a done-for-you lead gen program that lives inside <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenos-leads\">Revenos</a>, eXp’s elite suite of lead generation tools built specifically to find ready, willing, and able buyers and sellers—and hand them over to eXp agents only. Revenos includes eight powerful programs, but <em>Making It Rain</em> is the go-to when you want digital ads that convert without needing to learn what an impression share is.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you <em>know</em> you should be running Facebook ads for realtors, but the thought of managing pixels and budgets makes you want to hide under your desk. That’s where Making It Rain steps in. No need to watch another “How to do Facebook ads for real estate” video at 11 p.m.—eXp’s marketing team handles everything. Even if you’ve never launched a single realtor Facebook ad, this program helps you show up online like a pro (without losing your sanity in the process).</p>\n<p><strong>There are two flavors of “rain” to choose from, depending on who you’re targeting:</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"home-search-leads\">Home Search Leads</h3>\n<p>This one’s your best bet if you want buyers. <strong>eXp</strong> will launch a Google ad campaign designed to catch consumers actively searching for homes in your area. These aren’t cold leads—they’re warm, clickable, and landing on <em>your</em> site, not some giant portal with a million other agents. It’s digital farming at its finest, and frankly, it beats door-knocking in 100-degree weather.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"express-offers-leads\">Express Offers Leads</h3>\n<p>For eXp Realty agents who are certified in <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/express-offers\">Express Offers</a> and looking to scale their seller game, this program is a goldmine. It uses Facebook ads for real estate agents to drive homeowners to your iBuyer site. Think highly motivated seller leads delivered to your inbox while you’re out showing homes or, let’s be honest, trying to remember where you parked.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"178\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Express-Offers-Leads.webp\" alt=\"Express Offers Leads\" class=\"wp-image-267412\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Express-Offers-Leads.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Express-Offers-Leads-300x53.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Express-Offers-Leads-768x137.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Both of these lead-gen engines are official eXp products, so they come with built-in support and strategy help.

If you forget your password (we all do), hit “Forgot Password” or message eXp support—they’re surprisingly responsive. Bonus tip: two-factor authentication isn’t just for the paranoid. Use it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dive-into-the-e-xp-template-library\">Dive Into the eXp Template Library</h3>\n<p>Once inside, browse a huge collection of free Canva templates pre-approved by eXp’s branding team.

Drag and drop your property photos using the Listings App. Adjust colors, swap out text, and use tools like the built-in content generator to help with the copy. The background remover is perfect for cleaning up cluttered photos, and the resize tool helps your post go from Instagram square to email header in one click.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"download-and-share-like-a-pro\">Download and Share Like a Pro</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve built your masterpiece, download it in whatever format works best—PDF, PNG, you name it.

Not recommended unless you enjoy filing complaints after you’ve already unpacked the moving truck. From who attends the final walk through to what to look for during it, we’re covering everything to help you nail this last step like the real estate pro you are. Here’s your handy dandy index:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#what-is-a-final-walk-through-before-closing\">What Is a Final Walk Through Before Closing?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#steps-if-you-find-issues-during-the-walkthrough\">Steps If You Find Issues During the Walkthrough</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-a-final-walk-through-before-closing\">What Is a Final Walk Through Before Closing?</h2>\n<p>The final walk-through isn’t just a feel-good victory lap around the house. It’s your buyer’s last shot to make sure they’re not inheriting a leaky ceiling, a mysteriously absent stove, or “repairs” done with duct tape and hope. This is the moment to confirm that the property condition still matches the terms in the purchase agreement.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/eXp-Realty-Frequently-Asked-Questions.webp\" alt=\"Final Walk Through Before Closing, eXp Realty Frequently Asked Questions\" class=\"wp-image-264923 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/eXp-Realty-Frequently-Asked-Questions.webp 640w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/eXp-Realty-Frequently-Asked-Questions-300x113.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The goal? A clean and accurate property condition report, ideally without discovering a missing garage door or surprise pet damage. And if the home’s condition doesn’t match the contract, the buyer can hit the brakes faster than a bad credit score at underwriting.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-the-final-walkthrough-actually-matters\">Why the Final Walkthrough Actually Matters</h3>\n<p>This final check isn’t a chance to redecorate or get second thoughts on the paint color. It’s to confirm that repairs were done, nothing new is broken, and the seller didn’t swap your included appliances for something from 1992.</p>\n<p>This is your buyer’s last shot at a property condition assessment before the keys change hands. If that fridge is gone or the AC stopped working—now’s the time to catch it. Not after closing, when it becomes your buyer’s expensive surprise.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-does-the-walkthrough-happen-and-who-shows-up\">When Does the Walkthrough Happen and Who Shows Up?</h3>\n<p>So when is the final walk through? Usually 24 to 48 hours before closing—right when everyone’s nerves are already fried. That gives just enough time to flag issues and maybe negotiate before the documents start flying.</p>\n<p>Who attends the walkthrough? At a minimum the buyer and their real estate agent. Sometimes the seller tags along (usually awkwardly), and if the home’s older or had major repairs, bringing a home inspector can offer some extra peace of mind.</p>\n<p>Depending on the size of the home, expect this step to take anywhere from a quick 15-minute breeze-through to a full hour-long real estate walkthrough. Pro tip: doing this in an empty house is much easier. You’ll spot damage, scuffs, and last-minute “oops” moments the seller left behind.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"setting-the-right-expectations-for-the-buyer\">Setting the Right Expectations for the Buyer</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Before stepping foot into the walkthrough, your buyer needs to know exactly what’s going down—and what’s definitely not. This isn’t the time to start spotting things they missed during the inspection and suddenly expect a new roof. The final walk through is a confirmation mission, not a second inspection with bonus drama.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"496\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/How-Sisu-Supports-Real-Estate-Agents.webp\" alt=\"Final Walk Through Before Closing, How Sisu Supports Real Estate Agents\" class=\"wp-image-267033 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/How-Sisu-Supports-Real-Estate-Agents.webp 496w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/How-Sisu-Supports-Real-Estate-Agents-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-walkthrough-vs-home-inspection-know-the-difference\">Final Walkthrough vs. Home Inspection: Know the Difference</h3>\n<p>Let’s clear up the classic confusion: a home inspection happens early in the deal. That’s when buyers get the full diagnostic on the home—roof, foundation, outlets, ghost infestations, the works. Any problems found there? That’s when you negotiate repairs or concessions.</p>\n<p>The final walk through, on the other hand, happens near the finish line. Think of it like a pre-delivery check. You&#8217;re there to make sure nothing’s changed since the deal was struck. It’s a verification step, not a redo of the inspection.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-the-final-walkthrough-is-for\">What the Final Walkthrough Is For:</h3>\n<p><strong>Let’s keep it simple. The walkthrough before closing is for:</strong><br />• Confirming agreed-upon repairs are actually done (no, sticky notes that say “FIX ME” don’t count)<br />• Ensuring the seller’s stuff is gone—not “mostly packed”<br />• Verifying everything that worked before still works now</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-the-final-walkthrough-is-not-for\">What the Final Walkthrough Is Not For:</h3>\n<p><strong>This is not your buyer’s chance to:</strong><br />• Suddenly demand a full remodel<br />• Reopen negotiations because the wall color “hits different in daylight”<br />• Delay closing over stuff that should’ve been caught weeks ago</p>\n<p>Make sure your buyer knows the rules of the final walkthrough checklist game. Because nothing kills a vibe—or a sale—like unrealistic expectations and last-minute finger-pointing. Clear expectations = smooth closing. You’re welcome.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"essential-final-walk-through-checklist-a-k-a-the-lets-not-regret-this-list\">Essential Final Walk Through Checklist (a.k.a. The “Let’s Not Regret This” List)</h2>\n<p>The final walk through before closing isn’t the time to wing it with good vibes and crossed fingers. Bring a real checklist and treat this like what it is—a last opportunity to make sure you’re not about to inherit someone else’s half-finished honey-do list. Snap pics of anything sketchy to back up your concerns and protect your buyer (and your commission).</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Two-Days-Prior-to-Preparation.webp\" alt=\"Open House Checklist for Agents The Secret to 2x More Offers, Two Days Prior to Preparation, Final Walk Through Before Closing\" class=\"wp-image-262998\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Two-Days-Prior-to-Preparation.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Two-Days-Prior-to-Preparation-300x64.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Two-Days-Prior-to-Preparation-768x164.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p><strong>Here’s what to check during your final walkthrough real estate adventure:</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-verify-inspection-repairs\">1. Verify Inspection Repairs</h3>\n<p>Remember all those inspection-related fixes the seller promised? Time to confirm they actually got done. Plumbing, HVAC, windows, stains from unknown origins—if it was flagged, it needs to be handled. Ask for receipts or contractor invoices. No proof = no peace of mind.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-ensure-personal-items-are-gone\">2. Ensure Personal Items Are Gone</h3>\n<p>Unless the contract says you’re inheriting the seller’s treadmill or ancient cat tree, the house should be empty. “Broom clean” does not mean “bonus boxes in the attic.” This step is part of the verification of property condition—your buyer should walk into a clean slate, not a leftover yard sale.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-examine-the-interior-any-new-problems\">3. Examine the Interior – Any New Problems?</h3>\n<p>Do a full sweep for anything that wasn’t broken, dented, or mysteriously leaking the last time you saw the place. Sometimes the movers play fast and loose with doorways—and drywall. <strong>Check for:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>New holes or scuffs</li>\n<li>Damaged hardware</li>\n<li>Doors or garage systems that no longer function</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of this final pre-closing check is to ensure the home didn’t take a beating on its way out the door. If something looks off, flag it now—because after closing, that repair bill becomes the buyer’s parting gift.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-examine-outdoor-areas\">4. Examine Outdoor Areas</h3>\n<p>Don’t forget to walk the exterior. The final walk through of the house includes the backyard too. Fences suddenly falling? Moved staging pot uncovered a big hole in the deck? No one wants to discover a broken sprinkler system on move-in day—or worse, a pile of debris that didn’t make it into the moving truck.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"steps-if-you-find-issues-during-the-walkthrough\">Steps If You Find Issues During the Walkthrough</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Comparing-Traditional-Brokerages-and-eXp-Realty-Support.webp\" alt=\"Final Walk Through Before Closing, Comparing Traditional Brokerages and eXp Realty Support\" class=\"wp-image-266511 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Comparing-Traditional-Brokerages-and-eXp-Realty-Support.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Comparing-Traditional-Brokerages-and-eXp-Realty-Support-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>So, you’re 24 hours from closing, and the final check just revealed a fridge gone rogue or a couch-sized dent in the drywall. Now what? This is where speed and clarity matter.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"start-with-clear-communication\">Start with Clear Communication</h3>\n<p>Don’t panic—just document. Whip out your phone and start snapping photos of anything that doesn’t match the agreement. Whether it’s undone repairs, missing items, or new damage from the seller’s grand exit, you need evidence.</p>\n<p>Then contact the listing agent right away. The faster you flag the problem, the faster the seller can fix it—or at least start groveling. Keep it factual. Notes and photos make sure everyone’s working from the same page.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"explore-options-for-resolution\">Explore Options for Resolution</h3>\n<p><strong>Depending on the issue, you’ve got a few paths forward:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Request Repairs:</strong> Quick fixes are possible if there’s still time—and the seller’s willing.</li>\n<li><strong>Ask for Credits or Concessions:</strong> Sometimes money off at closing is easier than scrambling to get someone in with a toolbox.</li>\n<li><strong>Bring in a Contractor:</strong> Get quotes for the damage to provide leverage for negotiations.</li>\n<li><strong>Cancel the contract:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/final-walk-through-tips/#:~:text=Can%20I%20back%20out%20after,moves%20forward%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20says.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">whether you can will be dependent on your agreement</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evaluate the severity. A missing towel rack? Mildly annoying. A flooded basement? That’s gonna need more than a Home Depot run.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"delay-closing-if-necessary\">Delay Closing If Necessary</h3>\n<p>Major problems—like safety issues or incomplete repair work—might mean postponing the close. It’s not ideal, but better than taking ownership of a house that doesn’t meet contract terms. The goal here is to ensure the condition of the property aligns with what was promised.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"renegotiate-like-a-pro\">Renegotiate Like a Pro</h3>\n<p>If the home’s condition doesn’t match what was agreed upon, renegotiating may be the cleanest fix. Adjust the price, ask for closing cost credits, or add a repair escrow to the deal. Go into the conversation with clear priorities—what’s a must, and what’s negotiable?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The ultimate goal? Get your buyer the home they expected without letting issues derail the entire deal. Handling this part like a boss shows you’re not just closing transactions—you’re protecting people. And in the world of final walk through real estate, that’s the difference between a frazzled agent and a trusted one.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/exp-employees-Why-This-Matters-for-Real-Estate-Agents.webp\" alt=\"exp employees, Why This Matters for Real Estate Agents, So, you’re 24 hours from closing, and the final check just revealed a fridge gone rogue or a couch-sized dent in the drywall.

Don’t show up empty-handed or wide-eyed. This isn’t the time for a casual stroll to “get a feel” for the place one last time. It’s your buyer’s final property condition check, and they need to walk through like they’re on a mission—because they are.</p>\n<p>Coming in prepared helps catch missed repairs, abandoned junk, or any move-out surprises before they become your buyer’s responsibility. That’s where your trusty walkthrough checklist comes in—your personal “catch it now or regret it later” guide.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-bring-for-the-final-property-review\">What to Bring for the Final Property Review</h3>\n<p><strong>Heading into this last look? Pack smart. Here’s what you’ll want on hand during the pre-closing property review:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The purchase contract</strong> – to cross-check what was promised vs. what’s actually there</li>\n<li><strong>A notepad or mobile device</strong> – to record any “wait, what is that?” discoveries</li>\n<li><strong>A camera or phone</strong> – for photo evidence (you know, in case that fridge is mysteriously missing)</li>\n<li><strong>A flashlight</strong> – because basements and crawl spaces are never fully lit or fully innocent</li>\n<li><strong>Inspection report + receipts</strong> – to confirm every repair got done, not just “sort of handled”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Going into the final check before closing without these? That’s like showing up to a listing appointment without comps. Be thorough, be organized, and give your buyer peace of mind before they sign the dotted line.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-walk-through-before-closing-why-its-the-last-line-of-defense\">Final Walk Through Before Closing – Why It’s the Last Line of Defense</h2>\n<p>The final walk through before closing isn’t just a formality—it’s the buyer’s last chance to make sure the home is in the agreed-upon condition.

It confirms repairs are complete, items are removed, and nothing new is broken.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">When does the final walk through happen?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">The final walk through usually happens 24 to 48 hours before closing. This gives time to resolve last-minute issues if anything’s out of place.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Who attends the final walk through?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Typically, the buyer and their real estate agent attend the final walk through. Sometimes the seller or an inspector may also be present, depending on the situation.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What should I look for during the final walk through?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">During the final walk through, check that all repairs were done, personal items are removed, appliances and systems are working, and no new damage has occurred.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Can a seller refuse a final walk through?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">While uncommon, a seller can technically refuse access. However, this raises red flags and may violate terms of the purchase agreement, depending on your contract and state laws.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Does the house need to be empty for the final walk through?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Yes, ideally. An empty house makes it easier to spot damage, check repairs, and ensure nothing was left behind. It also confirms the seller has vacated as agreed.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What happens if problems are found during the final walk through?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">If issues are discovered, the buyer can request repairs, financial concessions, or delay closing. Documentation and quick communication with the listing agent are key.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

In short, it’s a real estate transaction management and analytics platform that’s finally figured out how agents actually work—in chaos, under pressure, with five apps open and one eye on the calendar. Sisu simplifies that mess into one clean command center.</p>\n<p>Instead of juggling a CRM and a dozen disconnected tools, Sisu puts everything in one place. Think of it as your real estate ops hub: transaction management, team collaboration, and marketing analytics all flowing together. From lead source tracking to client transparency portals, it’s built for realtors who are done wasting time and want real control.</p>\n<p>Bonus: it plays nicely with your current CRM. Sisu’s open integrations mean you don’t have to give up what’s already working—you just get more out of it. This kind of flexibility is what makes Sisu a no-brainer for agents and brokers looking to boost performance without hiring a full-time spreadsheet wizard.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-sisu-supports-real-estate-agents\">How Sisu Supports Real Estate Agents</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>If you’re drowning in task reminders and your “systems” include a whiteboard and wishful thinking, Sisu might just be your new therapy.

As with most real estate jokes, they’re the best kind of wit, based on sharp wordplay and puns, which makes them funny and illuminating. They’re widely accessible, making them perfect for real estate agents, buyers, sellers, or anyone with a basic understanding of the property market.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Their charm is in the universal appeal, making jokes about a struggle we all face, whether it’s that difficult customer or the always dreaded low commission. A perennial favorite has a buyer unable to make up his mind who says only “10% of people don’t like your carpet.&#8221; This hyperbole embodies the real fears of prospective homebuyers while eliciting some serious laughs. Much of the wit of these gags requires a second glance, rewarding the more thoughtful observers who linger on them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"what-makes-them-funny\">What Makes Them Funny?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The best real estate jokes are based on universal themes. They play off the surprise of the market and focus on the weirdness of home showings. Wordplay and puns are the heart of their charm, needing only a little industry know-how to get the joke, not Ph.D. Level expertise.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Context is everything, as these are the kind of jokes that are most enjoyed by colleagues in the field who get the subtleties. Shared experiences amplify humor, as professionals can relate to scenarios like dealing with indecisive clients or the endless paperwork involved in transactions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"humor-in-real-estate-sales\">Humor in Real Estate Sales</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Real estate humor can actually be a very valuable tool as a real estate sales professional, breaking the ice in client meetings or open houses and relieving tension. Second, it humanizes your brand, making it easier to build rapport with potential buyers and sellers, and creating more personable interactions.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Humorous asides can turn otherwise mundane real estate listings into page-turning thrillers. Finding that midpoint between professionalism and humor is absolutely key. The key is to keep jokes relatively tasteful and use them infrequently enough that they enhance, rather than distract from, the serious business at hand.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A light-hearted joke about how so many homes still have pink bathrooms will help you lower their guard. Additionally, it helps maintain the buzz on the sale.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"types-of-real-estate-jokes\">Types of Real Estate Jokes</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Types-of-Real-Estate-Jokes.webp\" alt=\"Types of Real Estate Jokes\" class=\"wp-image-266882\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Types-of-Real-Estate-Jokes.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Types-of-Real-Estate-Jokes-300x66.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Types-of-Real-Estate-Jokes-768x169.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">There are some real estate jokes that are just plain silly. From one-liners and puns to roasts, these jokes bring an interesting spark to conversations, leaving a lasting impression.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Here’s a closer look at the different types:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>One-liners:</strong> Short and snappy, ideal for getting the conversation started.</li>\n<li><strong>Puns:</strong> Playful twists on words, often related to real estate terms.</li>\n<li><strong>Roasts:</strong> Gentle, humorous critiques that lighten the mood.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-agentspecific-jokes\">1. Agent-Specific Jokes</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Agent-specific jokes target the unique challenges agents face every day. They feature relatable situations such as stressful open houses or high-maintenance clients, creating an inside joke that bonds realtors together at industry networking mixers.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Here are some common scenarios:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I’d say about ninety percent of the people in this city hate carpeting. The remaining 10% simply despise your carpeting.</li>\n<li>How many agents to screw in a light bulb? One to be on top of the bulb, seven to change the bulb, and one to take the credit. One to charge you a 1.5% commission to break even.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-clever-oneliners\">2. Clever One-Liners</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Quick quips are short but witty, and great for social media laughs. They nailed social media marketing and they really connect with clients.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Some memorable examples include:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How do real estate agents sell boats? They list them on Sail!</li>\n<li>Why did the realtor go to the casino? Because she heard properties were high stakes!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-creative-puns\">3. Creative Puns</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Creating real estate puns takes practice and a sharp sense of humor. Puns are an entertaining way to inject levity into otherwise serious topics, and they are super memorable in marketing collateral.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Examples include:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An ode to the many types of real estate humor, pun by pun.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"4-humorous-roasts\">4. Humorous Roasts</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Roasting in real estate is when good-natured ribbing happens between industry friends. It builds camaraderie and brings levity to the workplace.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The key to success is understanding your audience. Examples of roasts include:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What’s the difference btw a realtor and a picnic table? The picnic table can support a family of four</li>\n<li>What’s the difference between a Realtor and a Mortgage Broker? The Mortgage Broker knows he’s boring.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"engaging-real-estate-themes\">Engaging Real Estate Themes</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Engaging-Real-Estate-Themes.webp\" alt=\"Engaging Real Estate Themes\" class=\"wp-image-266884\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Engaging-Real-Estate-Themes.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Engaging-Real-Estate-Themes-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Engaging-Real-Estate-Themes-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Real estate themes such as open houses, mortgages, and house hunting provide a goldmine of comedic opportunities. Current trends, such as the rise of remote work, can inspire jokes about finding the perfect home office or Wi-Fi signal.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By integrating these themes into marketing strategies, whether humorously or sincerely, agencies can cut through the noise and find a relatable connection with clients. For example, you could run an entire campaign under a “house hunting” theme. That flirty method can lean into the light-hearted concept of looking for “the one.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open houses</li>\n<li>Mortgages</li>\n<li>Property hunting</li>\n<li>Home offices</li>\n<li>Wi-Fi signals</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When employed creatively, these themes can help to shine a humorous light on the often-stuffy world of real estate. If designed correctly, they can be embedded into promotional marketing materials to engage and immerse audiences and encourage a fun and engaging user journey.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"lighthearted-and-fun-approaches\">Lighthearted and Fun Approaches</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A sense of humor is key in real estate. Playful humor also allows realtors to engage with people on an emotional level. Through the creation of clever and caring content, you’re able to ease client worries.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Simple jokes like a realtor’s prayer that we may see a tripling of GCI this year can go a long way to help lighten the mood. Authenticity is key; make sure you deliver your humor in an authentic way and it will always land better.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use puns related to real estate terms.</li>\n<li>Share funny anecdotes from past experiences.</li>\n<li>Create engaging social media posts with Canva.</li>\n<li>Use humor to address common real estate concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These strategies create a fun atmosphere while establishing trust and rapport.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"practical-uses-for-real-estate-jokes\">Practical Uses for Real Estate Jokes</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"201\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Practical-Uses-for-Real-Estate-Jokes.webp\" alt=\"Practical Uses for Real Estate Jokes\" class=\"wp-image-266885\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Practical-Uses-for-Real-Estate-Jokes.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Practical-Uses-for-Real-Estate-Jokes-300x60.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Practical-Uses-for-Real-Estate-Jokes-768x154.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">You may think that real estate jokes are a specialized hobby, but in fact they have very practical uses in the real estate business. Comedy can help defuse the atmosphere, relieve stress, break the ice, and ensure everyone feels comfortable and included.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When a client is comfortable, they are more likely to come forward with questions, allowing you to create the successful transactions they seek.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">During open houses, jokes can create a more relaxed environment. In email newsletters, they can help you stay top-of-mind with prospects and clients. Real estate jokes provide excellent icebreakers at deal closings to relieve the tension.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">In marketing campaigns, real estate humor draws potential clients in by creating memorable, engaging content. A well-placed, well-thought-out joke in an ad can leave a lasting impression.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">It can dazzle as much as an awesome Facebook ad, one that pulls people in. Humor does come into the picture when it comes to customer service and follow-ups. A real estate agent might use a playful note to remind clients of their services, making interactions more personal and enjoyable.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"enhancing-client-interactions\">Enhancing Client Interactions</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Making humor a part of client communications will increase client satisfaction and loyalty. Strategies include:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Using humor in emails and newsletters</li>\n<li>Sharing funny stories during meetings</li>\n<li>Personalizing follow-ups with a humorous touch</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When humor is involved, it becomes a memorable experience, but more importantly, it makes your clients feel special and understood. When clients connect your brand to those warm fuzzy feelings, they’ll come back and bring their friends.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Real estate jokes can help ease the tension of serious transactions, creating a fun shared experience for real estate pros and clients alike. They serve to break the ice when meeting clients and create a pleasant non-threatening appearance.</li>\n<li>Knowing the running themes, puns, and background of real estate jokes can make them even more hilarious. Shared experiences between real estate professionals tend to make the humor hit even harder.</li>\n<li>Each style of real estate joke, whether it’s a clever one-liner, a creative pun, or a humorous roast, has its own purpose. From marketing to networking, they provide an impactful forum to tackle these topics and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap!</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A well-timed <strong>real estate joke can break the ice, ease tension, and make you more memorable</strong> to clients and colleagues.

In the simplest terms, a real estate referral is when you, as an agent, connect a client with another agent who’s better suited to help them. Maybe the other agent has expertise in a specific area or they’re in a different location than you?  When you refer a client to this other agent and they successfully close a deal, you earn a referral fee—usually a percentage of the commission. So, the client gets the help they need and you get a nice reward for making the agent connection. It’s a win-win for everyone involved!</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"139\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Key-Questions-to-Ask-Before-Joining-a-Real-Estate-Team.webp\" alt=\"Key Questions to Ask Before Joining a Real Estate Team\" class=\"wp-image-262532\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Key-Questions-to-Ask-Before-Joining-a-Real-Estate-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Key-Questions-to-Ask-Before-Joining-a-Real-Estate-Team-300x42.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Key-Questions-to-Ask-Before-Joining-a-Real-Estate-Team-768x107.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"referral-example\">Referral Example</h2>\n<p>Let me give you an example to illustrate how this works in real life. Imagine Becky, a reputable eXp real estate agent in Los Angeles. Over the years, she’s built a strong network and frequently gets inquiries from clients who are outside her service area. Becky also has a YouTube channel where she lets people know that she can help them find a realtor in all 50 states and in 24 countries.</p>\n<p>One day, Becky gets an email from Adam, a potential client who’s looking to relocate to New York City and he wants to find an agent to help him buy a home there. Becky isn’t located in New York City but she can locate an eXp New York City agent to help Adam.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"301\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Referral-agent-Example.webp\" alt=\"Referral agent Example\" class=\"wp-image-266866 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Referral-agent-Example.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Referral-agent-Example-300x181.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Let’s say Becky locates Mike, an eXp agent who’s a specialist in New York City. Becky reaches out to Mike, and fills him in on Adam’s situation, and Mike agrees to take on the referral in exchange for a 25% referral fee. Becky and Mike sign a referral agreement and Mike starts working with Adam. After a few weeks, Mike successfully helps Adam find the perfect home, negotiates the deal, and closes the sale.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Mike earns his commission, and in line with the agreement, Becky receives 25% of that commission as her referral fee.

You need to find an agent, the hard way using the internet or, if you’re lucky, a company agent directory and then learn about the agent.  After that’s done, there’s lots more time expended. </p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"269\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Different-From-Other-Brokerages.webp\" alt=\"Different From Other Brokerages\" class=\"wp-image-266868 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Different-From-Other-Brokerages.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Different-From-Other-Brokerages-300x161.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Like endless time to go back and forth with the agent, track down the right forms, get all the correct parties to sign the forms, collect the forms, submit those to the right place, and then follow up with the agent to see if any deal was closed and make sure you get paid what was agreed to.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realtys-referral-tool\">eXp Realty’s Referral Tool</h2>\n<p>But with eXp Realty’s official referral tool, everything is streamlined. First, eXp’s referral tool provides an official eXp referral form that’s compliant across all U.S. states and territories. You literally have nothing to worry about or waste time thinking about.</p>\n<p>You can easily find an agent and auto-populate the form with the receiving agent’s name and contact information.  Then you enter the other necessary details and sign the form.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"268\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eXp-Realtys-Referral-Tool.webp\" alt=\"eXp Realty’s Referral Tool\" class=\"wp-image-266869 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eXp-Realtys-Referral-Tool.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/eXp-Realtys-Referral-Tool-300x161.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Now eXp takes care of the rest.  The tool sends the agreement to all parties for eSignatures including the appropriate brokers, while shielding your client’s information until the agreement is fully signed. This ensures your client’s privacy is protected, and you’ve got a legally binding agreement in place.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>After the agreement is signed, the client’s information is automatically shared with the receiving agent, and all you have to do is add your referral agreement to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/skyslope\">skyslope</a>, sit back and wait for your referral fee to come in. eXp keeps track of it all! It’s so simple!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-grow-a-referral-business\">How to Grow a Referral Business</h2>\n<p>Now that you know how easy it is to make referrals and how lucrative it can be, let’s talk about how you can get started making referrals.  Here are some steps:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-1-focus-on-referral-agent-business\">Step 1: Focus on the Referral Agent Business</h3>\n<p>This is an awesome opportunity to grow your real estate career and boost your reputation, and the best part? You don’t need extra licenses or courses to jump in. Once you’ve got your real estate license and you’re aligned with a brokerage, you can immediately start positioning yourself as a reliable referral agent. If you’re good at generating leads, this is where you can really shine.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-2-build-a-strong-referral-network\">Step 2: Build a Strong Referral Network</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The quality of your referrals depends on the agents in your network, so build it wisely. Create a list of trusted agents with a proven track record of closing deals and delivering excellent service. Don’t just refer clients to friends—your reputation is at stake. Make sure the agents you’re referring to will get the job done. Keep your network organized in a spreadsheet or CRM so you can track your contacts easily.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Build-a-Strong-Referral-Network.webp\" alt=\"Build a Strong Referral Network\" class=\"wp-image-266867 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Build-a-Strong-Referral-Network.webp 498w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Build-a-Strong-Referral-Network-300x182.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-3-find-prospects-needing-service-outside-your-area\">Step 3: Find Prospects Needing Service Outside Your Area</h3>\n<p>Stay alert for opportunities when people mention relocating or needing real estate services you don’t provide. By being proactive, you can create a steady stream of referrals from those needing service outside your location or specialty.</p>\n<p>And if you’re with eXp, you’ve got a bonus: <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/my-link-my-lead\">eXp’s <em>My Link My Lead</em> platform</a>. It helps you identify people in your sphere who are moving, investing, or looking for properties outside your area. It’s a game-changer for keeping tabs on potential referrals. We’ll break down that awesome platform in a future blog.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-4-promote-your-referral-network\">Step 4: Promote Your Referral Network</h3>\n<p>If you want to grow your referral business, you’ve got to make sure people know about it. Set aside time for <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/events\">events, conferences, and networking</a> to expand your reach. Add your referral agent services to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/agent-website\">your website</a>, business cards, social media profiles, and marketing materials.</p>\n<p>Remind your clients—whether through newsletters or social media—that you can assist with transactions in other locations or even with different property types, like commercial real estate. Keep yourself at the top of their minds as their go-to referral resource.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5: Use the Referral Tool</strong></p>\n<p>You’ve worked to find people who need real estate services that you can’t provide. Now just hit the link to the eXp Referral Tool and spend a few seconds to get that cash ball rolling!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"theres-more\">There’s More</h2>\n<p>But here’s where it gets even better: <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/referral-division\">eXp Realty has an actual Referral Division</a> designed for agents who want to focus <em>only</em> on referral income.

It was built to make property sharing between agents way easier back when the internet was still trying to figure itself out (we’re talking early 2000s—aka dial-up era).</p>\n<p>Now, it powers <em>IDX websites</em> that help buyers browse homes like pros and help you generate leads while you sleep.
