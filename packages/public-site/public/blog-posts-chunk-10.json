It is whether you know where your next client is coming from.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most licensing programs teach compliance, not client acquisition. New agents leave class knowing how to avoid lawsuits, but not how to build a pipeline. Traditional brokerages often rely on name recognition while offering little structure for consistent lead generation.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty approaches this differently. Instead of asking new agents to “figure it out,” the platform is built around systems, automation, and training designed to help agents generate leads, follow up consistently, and convert opportunities into closings.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This article explains how eXp Realty new agent leads fit into the broader <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/leads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty Leads ecosystem</a> available to eXp agents.

The <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/revenos-leads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Revenos Division</strong></a> provides eXp agents access to exclusive corporate, relocation, military, iBuyer, and institutional investor leads — not low-quality, recycled internet leads you’re forced to fight for at other brokerages.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024 alone, Revenos leads helped generate over $2 billion in closed sales for eXp agents. Through eight specialized programs like ExpressOffers, eXp Relocation, Honor Military Rewards, Affinity Corporate Programs, Institutional Investment Services, REO, Bundle Select, and Making It Rain, agents can choose the lead types that fit their business goals.

While every agent gets eXp’s corporate tools, the <a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/basics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best eXp sponsors</a> go way beyond that.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When you partner with teams like Smart Agent Alliance (also part of the Wolf Pack), you get a lot more lead generation firepower. More on that below.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bottom line: With the right eXp sponsor, you’re not just getting leads &nbsp;&#8211; &nbsp;you’re building a lead generation machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-new-agents-at-e-xp-gain-confidence-faster\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why New Agents at eXp Gain Confidence Faster</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s be honest &nbsp;&#8211; &nbsp;confidence in real estate doesn’t come from reading more contracts. It comes from knowing you’ve got a system that actually works.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>When you have predictable lead generation built into your business from day one:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You’re not waking up every morning wondering where your next buyer or seller is hiding.</li>\n<li>You follow a repeatable pipeline-building plan that fills your CRM while you focus on closings.</li>\n<li>You know exactly what to say, when to say it, and how to convert because you’ve rehearsed it in live coaching and weekly trainings.</li>\n<li>Instead of spinning your wheels for months, you’re stacking contracts within your first 90 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is why eXp Realty agents, especially those who plug into strong sponsor teams like Smart Agent Alliance, are closing deals while most new agents are still watching YouTube videos trying to figure it out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lead-generation-is-the-1-reason-new-agents-succeed-or-quit\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lead Generation Is the #1 Reason New Agents Succeed or Quit</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let’s lay it out: most <strong>new real estate agents</strong> don’t quit because they’re lazy. They quit because they’ve got zero clue where their next client is coming from.

CRMs, IDX websites, automation, and daily training support consistent lead generation and follow-up, which can reduce the time between licensing and first closings when used consistently.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-e-xp-realty-compare-to-traditional-brokerages-for-new-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does eXp Realty compare to traditional brokerages for new agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional brokerages often emphasize independence early, expecting new agents to build systems on their own. eXp Realty focuses on platform access, automation, and shared infrastructure, giving new agents structured tools and training instead of relying primarily on office traffic or personal networks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-realty-designed-for-brand-new-agents-or-experienced-agents-only\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is eXp Realty designed for brand-new agents or experienced agents only?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty is structured to support agents at different career stages. New agents typically use the platform’s training, CRM, and automation to build foundational skills, while experienced agents use the same systems to scale. The tools are shared, but how they are used varies by experience level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-sponsor-teams-matter-for-new-agent-success-at-e-xp\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do sponsor teams matter for new agent success at eXp?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. While the brokerage platform is the same, sponsor teams vary in onboarding support, accountability, and system guidance. This difference often affects how quickly new agents implement tools and gain confidence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-bottom-line-the-right-lead-generation-system-changes-everything\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty’s New Agent Leads are designed to help newly licensed agents access early lead opportunities, but they do not operate in isolation or replace the broader eXp Realty experience.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life.

New eXp Realty agents have access to brokerage-provided CRM options such as BoldTrail or Lofty. These platforms include lead management, automated follow-up, basic marketing workflows, and nurture campaigns. Agents may choose which CRM best fits their business, but access to CRM tools is part of the core brokerage offering.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752691799708\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is an IDX website included for new eXp agents?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. Agents using BoldTrail or Lofty receive a branded IDX website as part of the platform. These sites include lead capture functionality and integrate directly with the agent’s CRM. The IDX site supports organic lead capture rather than serving as a replacement for active prospecting or marketing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752691809441\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Are Revenos leads required for new agents?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Revenos is eXp Realty’s optional corporate lead division and is not required for new agents. Participation depends on program eligibility and certification. New agents may build their business using referrals, organic lead strategies, or other tools without enrolling in any Revenos program.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752691835539\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Do new agents have to purchase leads to succeed at eXp Realty?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Many eXp agents build successful businesses using organic marketing, referrals, sphere of influence, and automated follow-up systems. Paid lead programs exist as optional accelerators, not requirements.

New agents are supported through defined programs rather than informal office availability, which often varies widely at traditional brokerages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-realty-harder-for-new-agents-than-a-traditional-brokerage-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do new agents get enough guidance without an office environment?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yes. eXp replaces office-based guidance with certified mentors, daily broker access, and structured live and on-demand training. New agents can receive transaction support, contract guidance, and business coaching consistently, without relying on inconsistent office hours or physical proximity to managers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-realty-harder-for-new-agents-than-a-traditional-brokerage-1-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does eXp help new agents get their first deals faster?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp provides structured mentorship, FastCap production systems, and built-in marketing tools. These systems focus on practical skills, lead generation, and transaction execution, supporting new agents as they move from licensing to completed transactions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-realty-harder-for-new-agents-than-a-traditional-brokerage-1-1-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is eXp Realty best suited for among new agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty works best for new agents who want systems, accountability, and scalable tools rather than office supervision. Agents willing to follow structured programs and engage with training tend to benefit more than those expecting non-transactional oversight.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-this-matters-before-you-join-e-xp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty for new agents is designed to address use cases such as affordable startup costs, early deal support, lead generation access, and scalable training, but it does not operate in isolation or replace the broader brokerage experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752692249735\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Is eXp Realty good for new real estate agents?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. eXp Realty provides new agents with certified mentorship, daily broker access, and live and on-demand training delivered through centralized systems.Lower startup costs and built-in technology help reduce financial pressure while agents learn contracts, negotiations, and lead generation during their early transactions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752692256974\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>How much does it cost to join eXp Realty as a new agent?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>New agents pay an $85 monthly technology fee, a one-time startup fee, an 80/20 commission split, and a $16,000 annual cap. After reaching the cap, agents earn 100% commission for the remainder of the year, reducing long-term cost exposure.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752692267525\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Do new agents get a mentor at eXp Realty?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. Every new agent is assigned a local Certified eXp Mentor who provides transaction guidance, contract reviews, and business support for the first three deals. During mentorship, commission splits are adjusted, then revert to the standard 80/20 structure afterward.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752692274875\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Does eXp Realty offer live training for new agents?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. eXp offers more than 60 live classes weekly, structured FastCap programs, and over 400 on-demand courses through eXp University. Training covers contracts, lead generation, marketing, negotiations, and business planning, supplementing mentor support.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752692282681\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Why does sponsor choice matter at eXp Realty for new agents?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Sponsor teams are not required to provide support, so value varies widely. Strong sponsors may offer coaching, systems, marketing tools, and accountability beyond corporate training. Evaluating sponsor resources can significantly impact how quickly new agents gain traction.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"related-e-xp-realty-fit-guides\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related eXp Realty Fit Guides</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/feeling-like-a-number/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feeling Like Just a Number at Your Brokerage?

At its essence, it’s about identifying the intersection of shared interests that provides value for everyone involved.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This process protects and helps both buyers and sellers. It enables them to negotiate on important items like price, closing costs, and repairs in good faith. In real estate, negotiations typically begin with an opener and proceed through stages, including counteroffers, before agreeing to terms.</p>\n<p>Meeting in person or talking over the phone can be critical when working out the details.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/383d1422cba82e6c-What-are-Real-Estate-Negotiations.webp/public\" alt=\"What are Real Estate Negotiations\" class=\"wp-image-269225 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/What-are-Real-Estate-Negotiations.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/What-are-Real-Estate-Negotiations-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-negotiation-skills-matter\">Why Negotiation Skills Matter</h3>\n<p>It’s why fierce negotiation skills are at the very core of winning clients the best possible deals. Good negotiators are<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> mediators</a>, able to diffuse tension and conflict by uncovering common ground and mutually beneficial solutions.</p>\n<p>They maintain a crucial advantage in the cutthroat commercial and residential real estate market, continuing to steer clear of fads and advisor disintermediation in a hyper-transactional marketplace. Rejecting a proposal doesn’t mean the end – doing so often just creates room for more negotiation and revision.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-elements-of-successful-negotiation\">Key Elements of Successful Negotiation</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/031433e8a5f9f327-Key-Elements-of-Successful-Negotiation.webp/public\" alt=\"Key Elements of Successful Negotiation\" class=\"wp-image-269221 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Key-Elements-of-Successful-Negotiation.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Key-Elements-of-Successful-Negotiation-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Key ingredients such as preparation, effective communication, and knowing what interests are at stake make for the best negotiations. Flexibility and creativity go a long way in overcoming hurdles, making sure these solutions work for all parties involved.</p>\n<p>Second, a win-win mindset is essential, building deeper relationships and enabling better transactions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-networking-to-improve-your-information-gathering-and-negotiation-strategy\">Use Networking to Improve Your Information Gathering and Negotiation Strategy</h3>\n<p>Networking is an excellent tool with which to gather information.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"preparing-for-negotiations\">Preparing for Negotiations</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"know-your-local-market\">Know Your Local Market</h3>\n<p>Researching the local market is essential to crafting winning negotiation tactics. Smart real estate agents will look at the trends in their market and make smart decisions on the price points. This includes comparing the property with similar properties to determine a competitive asking price.</p>\n<p>For example, information about the sale price of other nearby homes with similar attributes can give you bargaining power during negotiations. Knowing your neighborhood’s dynamics, such as what developments are coming in, or what your school district’s rating is, makes your case much stronger.  Not sure where to start?  Check out your local MLS for stats or use <a href=\"https://www.narrpr.com/market-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RPR, Research tab, Residential Market Trends</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conduct-thorough-research\">Conduct Thorough Research</h3>\n<p>In short, diligent research is the key to winning negotiations. By examining buyer demographics and preferences, real estate agents can adapt their strategies to align with what buyers are looking for.</p>\n<p>Researching comparable sales and current market conditions can provide a picture of the most effective approach to negotiation. In addition, putting together a list of potential buyer issues &#8211; like its condition or what amenities your community has &#8211; lets agents respond to objections before they’re raised.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"define-clear-goals\">Define Clear Goals</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Clearly defined, measurable goals are key to informing your negotiation priorities and discussions. Agents need to focus on these client objectives, getting to the heart of what is most important to the client.</p>\n<p>Being clear about these goals with everyone involved from the get-go helps avoid mismatched expectations or other confusion down the road.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/89f5d975330c638a-Define-Clear-Goals.webp/public\" alt=\"Define Clear Goals\" class=\"wp-image-269220 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Define-Clear-Goals.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Define-Clear-Goals-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"essential-strategies-for-effective-negotiation\">Essential Strategies for Effective Negotiation</h2>\n<p>Navigating real estate negotiations requires developing strategies that best serve client interests while adapting to competitive conditions. It’s less about having a rigid negotiation strategy, more about having a flexible plan that can adapt on the fly to the buyer’s reaction to the plan.</p>\n<p>Develop a culture of collaboration and partnership to empower honest conversation and joint problem-solving. This is a great first step in changing the narrative from a zero-sum game to a more collaborative win-win.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-master-the-push-pull-persist-technique\">1. Master the Push, Pull, Persist Technique</h3>\n<p>The push, pull, persist approach is especially important in tough situations. This means presenting offers fairly but assertively, typically influenced by the first anchor offer, but still allowing for buyer counteroffer input.</p>\n<p>Persisting keeps the conversation going even when there is pushback and allows negotiations to continue to be fruitful.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-set-realistic-expectations\">2. Set Realistic Expectations</h3>\n<p>Establishing realistic expectations around price and terms is key. By educating clients on the current state of the market, you can set the right expectations and avoid disappointment.</p>\n<p>This approach also helps in developing patience and understanding during negotiations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-manage-emotions-and-stay-positive\">3. Manage Emotions and Stay Positive</h3>\n<p>Arriving with a cool head makes for a constructive atmosphere. Identifying emotional triggers and defusing them with positive language and body language helps establish and maintain a positive environment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-base-decisions-on-market-value\">4. Base Decisions on Market Value</h3>\n<p>Providing valid market data to defend offers and counteroffers sets a fair price for negotiation. Analyzing like-kind properties and using those findings to inform negotiations strengthens negotiation positions.</p>\n<p>This practice makes for stronger arguments during discussions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-be-ready-to-walk-away\">5. Be Ready to Walk Away</h3>\n<p>Set client expectations around what it may mean to walk away from the deal if negotiations do not go as planned. By focusing on a strong BATNA, you increase your confidence in the deal and leverage your willingness to walk away.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"techniques-for-successful-communication\">Techniques for Successful Communication</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This is crucial in real estate negotiations. By listening to understand instead of reacting, we can learn what people really need and how we can best help them.</p>\n<p>Clarity: Articulating thoughts clearly helps prevent misunderstandings, ensuring all parties are on the same page. These prompt deeper conversations and help agents peel back the layers of why a client is motivated and identify concerns below the surface.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/c2dec28d13eb0269-Techniques-for-Successful-Communication.webp/public\" alt=\"Techniques for Successful Communication\" class=\"wp-image-269224 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Techniques-for-Successful-Communication.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Techniques-for-Successful-Communication-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"engage-in-direct-conversations\">Engage in Direct Conversations</h3>\n<p>Direct, honest dialogue reduces the risk of misinterpretation. There’s no substitute for the rapport built through face-to-face meetings, which help foster trust.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-questions-effectively\">Use Questions Effectively</h3>\n<p>Opening with strategic questioning can help you uncover what is important to the buyer. By guiding conversations with open-ended questions, we arrive at collaborative, win-win solutions. Encourage questions so that clients can assure themselves that they understand.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"prefer-face-to-face-communication\">Prefer Face-to-Face Communication</h3>\n<p>Face-to-face conversations are essential for developing trust. Agents should focus here first instead of spending a ton of time and money on digital strategies. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Non-verbal communication</a> provides a wealth of information in the negotiating process.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"arm-yourself-with-data\">Arm Yourself With Data</h3>\n<p>Building argumentation positions with data is critical. Proven data and market research add credibility to your claims. Credibility rests on the issue of whether you’re presenting current information.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leveraging-timing-and-offers\">Leveraging Timing and Offers</h2>\n<p>Timing is everything in real estate negotiations. When you know how the timing of your offers influences the course of negotiations, you give yourself an incredible advantage.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a markdown table to illustrate the impact:</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table class=\"has-fixed-layout\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Timing of Offer</td>\n<td>Impact on Negotiation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>End of Fiscal Quarter</td>\n<td>Landlords may offer favorable terms to close deals.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slower Market Period</td>\n<td>Less competition, potentially better deals for buyers.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Peak Season</td>\n<td>Higher competition may result in more aggressive offers.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leverage-timing-for-advantage\">Leverage Timing for Advantage</h3>\n<p>Negotiating with the right timing in mind can produce a sense of urgency. Reverse timing your negotiation for the end of the fiscal quarter can play to your benefit. For many landlords, the mad dash to close deals starts this time of year.</p>\n<p>Keeping an eye on market conditions helps you figure out the best times to make offers, matching buyer sentiment and market fluctuations. For example, winter is typically a slower time for the housing market, which means more favorable offers might be within reach.</p>\n<p>Understanding when these ups and downs happen puts you in the position to strike with laser-like focus.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"offer-multiple-choices\">Offer Multiple Choices</h3>\n<p>Providing more than one option increases decision-maker engagement and negotiation readiness. This method protects buyers’ needs and powers, while steering them toward the outcomes you want most.</p>\n<p>Showing the advantages of each choice makes it easier to compare and choose one. Showing alternative pricing models or payment plans can lure in prospective buyers.</p>\n<p>It makes them feel powerful, while at the same time leading them to a more favorable decision.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-escalation-clauses-effectively\">Use Escalation Clauses Effectively</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_clause\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Escalation clauses</a> are one way to make offers stronger &#8211; particularly in competitive situations. By structuring them smartly, you can protect your clients’ interests while signaling your good faith.</p>\n<p>These escalation clauses instantly ramp up your offer when faced with higher competing bids, showing you mean business. Even just setting a cap is a big first step to getting in control of your boundaries.</p>\n<p>That’s how you win the date and keep the client’s budget healthy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"building-rapport-and-trust\">Building Rapport and Trust</h2>\n<p>Building rapport and trust with clients goes a long way in making successful real estate negotiations. Here&#8217;s a few ways to get started:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pay attention to what clients say and reflect back.</li>\n<li>Empathy: Show understanding and share in their feelings.</li>\n<li>Personalized Communication: Tailor messages to make clients feel special.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/8a26638c9c99ff75-Building-Rapport-and-Trust.webp/public\" alt=\"Building Rapport and Trust\" class=\"wp-image-269219 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Building-Rapport-and-Trust.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Building-Rapport-and-Trust-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Talk about non-work things to build rapport and trust. Make notes for birthdays, hobbies, family members, etc. By investing time in understanding clients’ needs and preferences, agents can demonstrate clients are valued and respected.</p>\n<p>Casual chitchat prior to negotiating helps set a good mood, creating an environment where strong rapport can lead to better outcomes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"foster-goodwill-through-reciprocity\">Foster Goodwill Through Reciprocity</h3>\n<p>Creating goodwill is another way to build trust. Providing concessions to counterparts can lead to greater collaboration and a continued spirit of cooperation. Experienced Fredericksburg realtors can best guide you through which concessions are fair and what they should look like given market trends and the condition of the property.</p>\n<p>Small acts of goodwill – an understanding with regards to timelines or fixing small repairs – can go a long way toward winning a buyer’s favor. This strategy underscores the value of reciprocity in negotiations and aids in building relationships that last well past the present transaction.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"encourage-agreement-as-their-idea\">Encourage Agreement as Their Idea</h3>\n<p>Making sure clients feel a sense of ownership over agreements will help boost their level of commitment. It is often possible to maneuver discussions to get clients to view settlements as their own solutions.</p>\n<p>Persuasive techniques that frame recommendations the right way can help deepen client engagement. Beyond fortifying the negotiation process, this tactic cultivates satisfaction with results.</p>\n<p>By empowering the client to be the decision-maker, agents will set themselves up for better negotiations and more robust client relationships.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"maintain-transparency-and-ethical-practices\">Maintain Transparency and Ethical Practices</h3>\n<p>First and foremost, transparency and honesty are key from start to finish during the negotiation process. Help clients avoid distractions, keep their eye on the financial prize, and always keep communication lines open. Offer impartial advice that keeps emotion from influencing important decisions. This level of consistent engagement helps make sure everyone is on the same page about the details, minimizing the chance for last-minute surprises.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"managing-offers-and-counteroffers\">Managing Offers and Counteroffers</h2>\n<p>Smartly managing offers and counteroffers is one of the most important parts of successful real estate negotiations. Best practices are to avoid surprises, be honest about limitations, and know the power of a personal touch.</p>\n<p>Acting quickly on received offers prevents losing momentum, meaning everyone involved stays excited and eager to move forward.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Respond quickly to maintain interest.</li>\n<li>Be clear and transparent about constraints.</li>\n<li>Use structured frameworks for clarity.</li>\n<li>Prioritize face-to-face interactions when possible.</li>\n<li>Follow up verbal discussions with formal offers.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/492fa653aed48610-Managing-Offers-and-Counteroffers.webp/public\" alt=\"Managing Offers and Counteroffers\" class=\"wp-image-269222 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Managing-Offers-and-Counteroffers.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Managing-Offers-and-Counteroffers-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"present-offers-in-person\">Present Offers in Person</h3>\n<p>Delivering offers in person conveys a sense of sincerity and seriousness. Most importantly, it allows you to address concerns on the spot, which makes the negotiation feel more personal.</p>\n<p>This strategy builds mutual trust, which is crucial in any deep-dive transaction.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"discuss-by-phone-first\">Discuss by Phone First</h3>\n<p>These early phone conversations can help lay the groundwork for formal offers to come. They provide a way to hash out details and build rapport, making the jump to written communication much smoother.</p>\n<p>Putting it all down in writing with a formal offer goes a long way in memorializing the deal.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"use-a-framework-for-your-negotiation\">Use a Framework for Your Negotiation</h3>\n<p>A clear framework provides a roadmap for tough conversations, helping to keep negotiations on track. Important details, such as goals and timelines, as well as communication standards, keep everyone on track and working toward the same goal.</p>\n<p>It’s a big help in setting appropriate financial limits and bottom lines, which is key when you find yourself in a multiple offer scenario.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"advanced-negotiation-tactics\">Advanced Negotiation Tactics</h2>\n<p>Mastering advanced real estate negotiation tactics is key. Here are some advanced tactics to enhance your negotiation prowess:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Set a strong initial offer to anchor the discussion.</li>\n<li>Reflect the other party’s language and behavior to build rapport.</li>\n<li>Use silence to prompt the other party to fill the gap.</li>\n<li>Bundling: Combine offers to create value for both parties.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BATNA</a>: Know your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"550\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d103a72462d2c1c1-Advanced-Negotiation-Tactics.webp/public\" alt=\"Advanced Negotiation Tactics\" class=\"wp-image-269218 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Advanced-Negotiation-Tactics.webp 550w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Advanced-Negotiation-Tactics-300x164.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>These strategies allow you to develop a negotiation approach that is fluid and flexible. You can also boost your negotiation prowess by taking the <a href=\"https://www.crendesignation.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Certified Real Estate Negotiator (CREN) course</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/education/designations-and-certifications/real-estate-negotiation-expert-rene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real Estate Negotiation Expert (RENE) certification</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.onlineed.com/catalog/652/Mastering-Real-Estate-Negotiations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OnlineEd’s Negotiation skills training</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"control-your-emotions\">Control Your Emotions</h3>\n<p>In high-stakes negotiations, staying calm under fire is key. When emotions take over rational thought, we tend to get the short end of the stick.</p>\n<p>By intentionally practicing mindfulness and reducing stress, you open yourself up to making better decisions without confusion or miscommunication.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exhibit-patience-and-determination\">Exhibit Patience and Determination</h3>\n<p>Patience is important during negotiations, but it’s especially important during a seller’s market when multiple buyers are at play. A little time exploring the best possible choices will lead to better decisions, greater satisfaction, and often much better results.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"apply-anchoring-techniques\">Apply Anchoring Techniques</h3>\n<p>Anchoring greatly affects how we perceive and assign value. As the initial offer can set the anchor, this makes it a highly effective tactic in purely distributive negotiations.</p>\n<p>By strategically anchoring discussions, you can steer negotiations towards your ideal outcomes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mastering-negotiations-stay-fresh\">Mastering Negotiations – Stay Fresh</h2>\n<p>Mastering real estate negotiation is as much about preparation and strategy as it is about adaptability and communication.

It’s a pressure reliever for content creators, freeing them to focus on quality instead of constantly brainstorming new ideas.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"reach-more-people\">Reach More People</h3>\n<p>When you repurpose content, you open doors to audiences you might not be reaching.

Think timeless topics like &#8220;how-to&#8221; guides or industry insights that stay relevant year after year. A post on time management tips, for example, could be refreshed annually with updated examples. Skip outdated, hyper-specific pieces &#8211; like a blog tied to a 2024 event -unless you can adapt them to today’s trends.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/998d9e435f7eaa61-888888.webp/public\" alt=\"Hand holding a trophy against a golden bokeh background, symbolizing success for real estate agents during a recession.\" class=\"wp-image-4228 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888-300x133.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888-768x341.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Even older content can shine again with some tweaking. Refresh pre-pandemic posts to make them post-pandemic relevant or repurpose topics like &#8220;remote work best practices&#8221; to align with today’s hybrid work environment.

Use metrics like page views, social shares, and comments to pinpoint what resonates most. Aim to get at least five new pieces from one standout post to maximize its impact.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"focus-on-whats-relevant\">Focus on What’s Relevant</h3>\n<p>Staying relevant means knowing what your audience needs now. Revamp older posts to match current trends.

Extract key insights or stats, pair them with eye-catching graphics, and you’ve got engaging posts. A single blog could yield at least five mini posts &#8211; an intro, a highlight of the main takeaway, a quote graphic, and more. For instance, if your blog goes live on Friday, use the following week to break it into smaller, focused posts for different platforms.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"transform-blogs-into-infographics\">Transform Blogs into Infographics</h3>\n<p>Infographics are a fantastic way to simplify complex topics. Pull out key data or concepts from your blog and collaborate with a designer to create visuals that captivate. Share these visuals on platforms like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_(media)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Pinterest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href=\"https://x.com/\">X</a> to reach more visual learners. Track metrics like shares and clicks to measure impact and refine future infographics.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rework-blogs-into-email-newsletters\">Rework Blogs into Email Newsletters</h3>\n<p>Blogs can supercharge your email campaigns. Break down posts into short, actionable tips, like turning a home buyer guide blog into a “3 Quick Tips” email segment.

Focus on where the control is.</li>\n<li>Use cash offer programs to start seller conversations fast.</li>\n<li>Ditch Zestimates. Offer detailed home valuations with real market insight.</li>\n<li>FSBOs and expireds aren’t cold leads &#8211; they’re unfinished business.</li>\n<li>Farming still works &#8211; when you show up like a brand, not a billboard.</li>\n<li>Client referrals don’t happen unless you give them a reason to refer you.</li>\n<li>Divorce attorneys, local events, and small businesses = secret seller pipelines.</li>\n<li>Social media done right is a modern-day listing machine.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n<p>If you’ve ever cried in your car after another buyer ghosted you post-showing, welcome. This one’s for you.</p>\n<p>Because no matter how many times the industry changes or the NAR rewrites the rules, one thing hasn’t changed: listings = leverage. Listing agents still get more control, less chaos, and let’s be real, less time chasing texts that start with “we’ve decided to wait.”</p>\n<p>Yes, being a listing agent costs more upfront &#8211; photos, marketing, staging &#8211; but you’re also not spending your weekends unlocking doors for people whose “budget” is a Pinterest board and a dream. With the shift in buyer agent compensation (thanks NAR!), more buyers than ever are skipping agents altogether, but sellers? Sellers still need you. Badly. Especially if they want to avoid turning their property into a Zillow punchline.</p>\n<p>So let’s get serious about how to get listings as a real estate agent, even if you’re new, rebuilding, or just tired of crossing your fingers at open houses. Here’s your handy-dandy index:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#understand-the-market-first\">Understand the Market First</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"understand-the-market-first\">Understand the Market First</h2>\n<p>If you’re serious about figuring out how to get listings as a real estate agent, you need more than a surface-level market update. Sellers don’t want a weather report &#8211; they want you to tell them whether it’s raining inside <em>their</em> zip code. So before you even <em>think</em> about sending another “Just Listed” postcard, do the homework.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"start-with-the-big-picture-a-k-a-why-your-sellers-are-freaked-out\">Start with the Big Picture (a.k.a. Why Your Sellers Are Freaked Out)</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>You need to know what the national and regional housing trends are doing so you can sound like a pro &#8211; not someone who Googled “housing update” five minutes before a listing appointment.</p>\n<p>Interest rates. Inflation. Inventory shifts. These aren’t just headlines &#8211; they’re the reason your seller’s neighbor’s house sat for 93 days or why bidding wars went MIA in your town. Show your clients how the macro trends trickle down into their backyard. Literally.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3a9c4c45491f1c0c-Real-Estate-Math-Terms-That-Wont-Make-Your-Brain-Melt.webp/public\" alt=\"Real Estate Math Terms That Won’t Make Your Brain Melt\" class=\"wp-image-268521 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Real-Estate-Math-Terms-That-Wont-Make-Your-Brain-Melt.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Real-Estate-Math-Terms-That-Wont-Make-Your-Brain-Melt-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Demographic changes also matter. Are retirees moving in? Are millennials cashing out of downtown shoeboxes for suburban space?

If you want to be the agent who lands more real estate listings, this is where you ditch the cookie-cutter comps pitch and show them what really sells.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you need to do (no, really):</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Walk every comparable like a detective, because photos won’t tell you if the layout feels awkward, if the house smells like wet carpet and regret, if the neighbor’s dog has a barking problem, or if the traffic noise sounds like a freeway in the foyer. Use that information when you:</li>\n<li>Pull recent sales in the neighborhood and break them down by feature. Are homes with pools moving faster than homes with two-car garages? Is a remodeled kitchen getting offers in three days while grandma’s house with shag carpet sits for three months?</li>\n<li>Look at days on market, sale-to-list ratio, and price-per-square-foot trends. What’s the tipping point for price? What’s the bare minimum upgrade that gets attention?</li>\n<li>Analyze what actually makes the “sold” column &#8211; was it the open floor plan, the quartz countertops, or just the fact that it wasn’t painted beige?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now take those insights and build a real estate <a href=\"/blog/become-an-agent/\">listing presentation</a> that doesn&#8217;t just show comps &#8211; it <em>translates</em> them into action steps for your sellers.

You earn them by being visible, credible, and freakishly consistent. Especially in a market where homeowners are bombarded by “I have a buyer for your home” flyers from agents who couldn’t find their own name on the MLS.</p>\n<p>So whether you’re brand new and wondering how to get listings as a new real estate agent, or a seasoned pro looking to reboot, these listing strategies are designed to work now &#8211; not five years ago when inventory was falling out of the sky.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-offer-cash-deals-that-flip-the-script\">1.

That’s half the battle. They just don’t yet believe they need you… until their inbox fills with lowballs, scammers, and people asking if “rent-to-own” is an option.</p>\n<p>This is where you step in &#8211; not with pressure, but with clarity and actual value.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Build a FSBO-specific marketing kit with before/after listing photos, staging tips, pricing strategy breakdowns, testimonials, and a sample real estate listing presentation template.</li>\n<li>Offer easy-entry resources like a detailed CMA, home-selling checklist, or a newsletter that gives them real, actionable steps &#8211; without strings attached.</li>\n<li>Focus on what keeps them up at night: safety, time, liability, and paperwork nightmares. Let them know you’ve got it handled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow up like a human. Consistently &#8211; but never pushy. Keep adding value. That way, when they’re finally ready to stop playing listing agent, you’re the first one they call.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-implement-geographic-farming-no-not-the-corn-kind\">6.

This is about smart strategy, not just convenience.</li>\n<li>Mailers should give real value &#8211; like recent real estate listings that sold nearby, equity updates, or seasonal prep tips.</li>\n<li>Be present offline too: block parties, PTA meetings, school functions. Show up, be helpful, don’t be weird.</li>\n<li>Double up by hosting open houses for other listings in your farm and door-knocking the block with market data and that same irresistible home valuation offer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Track everything &#8211; mailers, events, ads.

Total win.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-work-your-sphere-like-a-pro-not-like-a-desperate-cousin\">10. Work Your Sphere Like a Pro (Not Like a Desperate Cousin)</h3>\n<p>Here’s a wild fact: most agents are sitting on a goldmine and don’t even realize it. If someone owns a home, they’re a future seller. Maybe not today &#8211; but someday. And if they <em>already know you</em>, that’s half the battle.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to be salesy. You just need to be visible, valuable, and slightly less forgettable than their last agent who vanished after closing day.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Send handwritten notes, birthday cards, or just a “thinking of you” text that doesn’t start with “just checking in…”</li>\n<li>Share real value: neighborhood sales updates, home equity estimates, and market trend emails that don’t make people’s eyes glaze over.</li>\n<li>Host low-key client events like happy hours, backyard BBQs, or coffee shop pop-ins.</li>\n<li>Schedule a quick “home equity check-in” every year &#8211; show them how much they’ve gained and offer a personalized CMA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is how you stay top of mind <em>without being that agent</em>. You’re not just building trust &#8211; you’re building a listing pipeline that doesn’t rely on strangers or cold calls.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-show-up-at-local-events-and-talk-like-a-human\">11. Show Up at Local Events (and Talk Like a Human)</h3>\n<p>Want to know how to get listings as a new real estate agent? Step one: leave the house.</p>\n<p>Local events &#8211; yes, even the ones with questionable lemonade and school choirs &#8211; are where real conversations happen. Because sellers aren’t looking for an agent when they’re ready… they’re looking for one they <em>already know</em> when the time comes.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Set up a booth at fairs, festivals, or community yard sales. Offer something simple: a home valuation QR code, a “what’s your home worth?” flyer, or just free bottled water.</li>\n<li>Volunteer for local causes. Show you care about more than closing deals.</li>\n<li>Go to events even when you’re not promoting. Chat. Be seen. Be helpful.</li>\n<li>Collect contact info (nicely). Offer to add them to your monthly newsletter full of local tips, home equity insights, and fun facts &#8211; not just boring listings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Real estate is still a relationship business. So put on your shoes, bring your smile, and maybe a few listing presentations in your trunk &#8211; just in case.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12-partner-with-local-businesses-because-visibility-trust\">12. Partner with Local Businesses (Because Visibility = Trust)</h3>\n<p>Still wondering how to get more listings in real estate without blowing your budget? Collaborate instead of advertise.</p>\n<p>Local businesses are also trying to build trust, get foot traffic, and look like community rockstars. That makes them ideal co-marketing partners.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 39%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Team up with coffee shops, gyms, bakeries, or salons for giveaways, cross-promotions, or email swaps.</li>\n<li>Feature one local business in each edition of your seller newsletter or social media series &#8211; then ask them to return the favor.</li>\n<li>Co-host community events like home-selling workshops, market trend nights, or pop-up consult booths during local art walks.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"340\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/4dc2dbeb0b97668d-Xp-Realty-Revenos-eXp-Affinity.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty Revenos - eXp Affinity.

Why? Because sellers vent about their life changes <em>everywhere</em>. Be the agent every business wants to refer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"13-run-smart-ads-that-speak-to-sellers\">13. Run Smart Ads That Speak to Sellers</h3>\n<p>Paid ads don’t have to feel like throwing money into the algorithm void. When done right, online advertising is one of the fastest ways to land real estate listings &#8211; especially if you use the right hook.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Focus your offer around real value: a no-obligation cash offer, a free 30-page CMA, or a “What’s My Home Worth?” equity report.</li>\n<li>Run ads on platforms where your potential sellers actually hang out: Facebook, Instagram, Nextdoor, Google, and even LinkedIn.</li>\n<li>Target by zip code, home value, age, and life stage. A 62-year-old in a 4-bed suburban home? Yeah, they might be open to downsizing.</li>\n<li>Use video tours, carousel ads, or short punchy clips to grab attention fast.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Track performance weekly. Double down on what’s working. Kill what’s not. You’re not just spending ad dollars &#8211; you’re buying attention, seller conversations, and future commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"14-tap-into-pre-foreclosure-leads-the-right-way\">14. Tap Into Pre-Foreclosure Leads (the Right Way)</h3>\n<p>No, it’s not slimy. Done well, helping people in pre-foreclosure is one of the most ethical and impactful ways to build your business <em>and</em> help your community.</p>\n<p>These homeowners are under stress. But they also <em>need options</em> &#8211; and most of them have no idea what those options are. Be the person who shows up with empathy <em>and</em> answers.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use tools like PropertyRadar or or follow <a href=\"https://www.distressedpro.com/reo-listings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DistressedPro’s</a> four-step guide to secure foreclosure listings directly from banks.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Offer real solutions: short sales, fast cash offers, or a traditional listing with a timeline they can manage.</li>\n<li>Build relationships with foreclosure attorneys or financial counselors who can refer clients that are overwhelmed.</li>\n<li>Provide printed guides or a custom listing checklist for sellers in distress.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Show up not to pitch, but to help. Do that, and you won’t just earn listings &#8211; you’ll earn a reputation for being the agent who <em>actually cares</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"15-leverage-social-media-without-turning-into-a-cringe-reels-influencer\">15. Leverage Social Media (Without Turning Into a Cringe Reels Influencer)</h3>\n<p>Social media doesn’t need to be a parade of pointing, lip syncing, or dancing (unless that’s your vibe &#8211; no judgment). What it does need is relevance, consistency, and a little humanity.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering how do you get listings as a real estate agent in today’s digital world &#8211; start here.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Post weekly updates about the local market, like “3 homes sold in XYZ neighborhood last week under 7 days.”</li>\n<li>Share before and after staging photos, sold stats, or a behind-the-scenes look at your listing presentation prep.</li>\n<li>Get in on neighborhood Facebook groups, local Reddit threads, and Nextdoor conversations.</li>\n<li>Ask for engagement: “Curious what your home is worth now?” or “Want to see what your neighbor’s home just sold for?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stay real, helpful, and just the right amount of visible. Social media isn&#8217;t magic. It&#8217;s just a modern version of door-knocking &#8211; with way better reach.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"you-dont-need-luck-you-need-leverage\">You Don’t Need Luck &#8211; You Need Leverage</h2>\n<p>There you have it: 15 no-fluff strategies for how to get listings as a real estate agent.

Ask detailed questions upfront &#8211; because you’re paying more, and what you get varies wildly. And, yes, online research about traditional brokerages is nearly impossible. Go to <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor.com</a> for some agent reviews.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"local-independent-boutiques\">Local Independent Boutiques</h3>\n<p>Usually run by a single broker, these offices might offer personalized mentorship, higher splits, and more autonomy than a franchise model. But training and tech depend entirely on the owner. If you like local vibes and direct access to leadership, this might be a fit. Just know that fewer staff means less support &#8211; and more is on you to figure out.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"discount-or-flat-fee-models\">Discount or Flat-Fee Models</h3>\n<p>Low-cost, high-split models sound great &#8211; until you need help. These brokerages charge per transaction or monthly, but usually offer minimal training or tech. Best for experienced agents, not those learning how to convert leads or write clean contracts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-roles-solo-team-or-sponsor-support\">Agent Roles: Solo, Team, or Sponsor Support</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve picked the best real estate brokerage for new agents, you still need to figure out how you’ll actually <em>work</em> inside that brokerage. You’ve got a few role options &#8211; and each one comes with its own mix of support, splits, and day-to-day reality.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/50899933c6d43622-How-Does-a-Real-Estate-Team-Work-Solo-Agent-vs.-Team-Member-Which-Path-is-Right-for-You.png/public\" alt=\"How Does a Real Estate Team Work , Solo Agent vs. Team Member Which Path is Right for You\" class=\"wp-image-262895\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/How-Does-a-Real-Estate-Team-Work-Solo-Agent-vs.-Team-Member-Which-Path-is-Right-for-You.png 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/How-Does-a-Real-Estate-Team-Work-Solo-Agent-vs.-Team-Member-Which-Path-is-Right-for-You-300x53.png 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/How-Does-a-Real-Estate-Team-Work-Solo-Agent-vs.-Team-Member-Which-Path-is-Right-for-You-768x136.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>Let’s break down your three main paths: going solo, joining a team, or leveraging sponsor support.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"solo-agent\">Solo Agent</h3>\n<p>Most agents start out as solo agents. That means you’re running your own show under your brokerage’s umbrella. You pay the fees, generate the leads, and figure out your systems. You’re basically a one-person business with a real estate license and a dream.</p>\n<p>This setup works best if your real estate brokerage for new agents actually offers strong onboarding, tech, and training. Otherwise, “solo” turns into “struggling in silence” &#8211; which is exactly why <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/why-do-real-estate-agents-fail.asp#:~:text=Many%20real%20estate%20agents%20typically,reputation%20and%20gain%20new%20clients.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">so many new agents tap out in year one</a>. Some push through until the overwhelm hits, then pivot to a production team for support.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-of-a-production-team\">Member of a Production Team</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/blog/become-an-agent/\">Production teams</a> are usually the first thing new agents hear about because they’re common inside most brokerages. These teams operate like mini-businesses designed to help agents buy and sell homes more efficiently. They typically provide leads, hands-on training, accountability, and a built-in sense of community. For many new agents, joining a team can be a fast-track to building confidence and closing deals—without having to reinvent the wheel on day one.</p>\n<p>But here’s the catch: not all teams are created equal. Just like with franchise offices and independent boutique brokerages, some teams offer legit training and support &#8211; others hand you a script and wish you luck.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Also, teams come with their own split <em>on top of</em> your brokerage split. So while the leads and mentorship might flow, your paycheck will shrink accordingly. Before joining, <a href=\"/blog/become-an-agent/\">ask questions</a> about what you can expect and ask to see the team agreement &#8211; including how to exit. Some teams make it easy to leave. Others? Not so much.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"501\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/bc4a0bb41c90a9cc-Standard-Teams-The-Startup-Squad-with-Structure.webp/public\" alt=\"Standard Teams The Startup Squad with Structure, A proper agent task management setup helps you filter the noise.

When you join, <a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/basics/\">you name a sponsor</a> &#8211; someone who benefits financially when you succeed. So in theory, they’re motivated to support you. In practice? Some do, some don’t. Everyone has time limits, so don’t count on endless hand-holding, especially from a solo sponsor.</p>\n<p>The smart move? Choose a sponsor who offers actual value &#8211; like real estate coaching for new agents, marketing systems, or community &#8211; not just someone who slid into your DMs with “Let’s win together!” vibes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"member-of-a-sponsor-team\">Member of a Sponsor Team</h3>\n<p>Sponsor teams are also specific to brokerages with a <a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/revenue-share/\">revenue share model</a>. These aren’t production teams &#8211; they don’t hold your hand through deals and most don’t take a split of your commissions. Instead, they provide tools, systems, and community designed to help you succeed as a solo agent. Think of it as an added layer of support – usually without an added layer of cost.</p>\n<p>The catch? At brokerages like eXp Realty, you have to choose your sponsor team <a href=\"https://joinapp.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">when you join eXp</a>. After that, you’re locked in &#8211; unless you leave the company for a full year and come back. So yeah, doing your homework isn’t optional. On the upside, online research about eXp sponsors will help you decide.</p>\n<p>Pick a sponsor team that’s organized, offers real tools and systems, and actually supports your production and revenue share goals. A strong community? That’s the frosting on your commission cake – and yeah, it matters!</p>\n<p>Bonus: At eXp (and most other brokerages), sponsor team members can join a production team anytime. So if you start solo and realize you need a bit more structure (read: someone to boss you around in a helpful way), you can always become a production team member too. Just follow the advice above to make sure you’re picking the <em>right</em> team, not just the loudest one.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-fees\">Commission Splits &#038; Fees</h2>\n<p>We’ll keep this quick &#8211; our other blogs go deep on commission math, hidden fees, and how to not feel broke after your first closing. This section is just the essentials.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/de3da5816d1f3691-1.webp/public\" alt=\"Woman holding a fan of hundred-dollar bills with a large green percentage sign, highlighting the debate over real estate commissions.\" class=\"wp-image-5382 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Commission splits are how your commission gets divided between you and your brokerage. The first number is <em>your</em> cut. So, if you&#8217;re on a 60/40 split, you keep 60%, and your brokerage takes 40%. Some brokerages use fixed splits, others use sliding scales that improve as you produce more. A few brokerages offer a cap &#8211; once you’ve paid in a set amount (<a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/100-percent/\">like eXp’s $16K</a>), you keep 100% for the rest of the year.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The tradeoff? Lower splits sometimes come with more support &#8211; like leads, training, and tech. Higher splits usually mean you’re more independent (read: figuring things out solo).</p>\n<p>Now let’s talk fees &#8211; tech fees, desk fees, franchise fees, transaction fees. Some brokerages charge monthly. Others take a cut per deal. It all adds up fast, especially when you&#8217;re still ramping up. You can compare these for yourself using our <a href=\"/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.</p>\n<p>In any event, before you commit to a brokerage, ask for a detailed fee sheet: upfront, monthly, and per-transaction. Then check out our blogs on <a href=\"/&#039;/real-estate-agent-job/career/commissions\">commission splits</a> and <a href=\"/&#039;/best-real-estate-brokerage/fees\">fees</a> so you know what you’re really taking home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"key-factors-for-new-agent-success\">Key Factors for New Agent Success</h2>\n<p>Now that you’ve got a grip on brokerage types, splits, and fees, it’s time to talk about what <em>really</em> drives your success in this business. Because let’s be real &#8211; the best real estate brokerage for new agents isn’t the one with the flashiest office or the prettiest signs. It’s the one that actually sets you up to close deals, stay sane, and make it past year one.</p>\n<p>A good fit means more than a name you recognize. It means real estate training for new agents that doesn’t suck, support when you hit a wall, and tools that actually help &#8211; not just look good in a sales pitch. These are the six key factors that separate thriving agents from the ones quietly ghosting their license renewal notices.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-training-onboarding\">1. Training &#038; Onboarding</h3>\n<p>Getting licensed teaches you how not to break the law. But getting trained teaches you how to actually sell houses.</p>\n<p>Great brokerages start with a clear onboarding process (for example, <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/onboarding/\">here’s eXp’s</a>) and continue with real estate coaching for new agents that includes contracts, negotiations, scripts, and even how to survive your first open house without crying in the bathroom. In competitive markets that includes local rules, city-specific disclosures, and hands-on practice &#8211; not just theory.</p>\n<p>Look for brokerages that go beyond “read this PDF.” Weekly live sessions, role-playing, deal debriefs, shadowing top producers &#8211; that’s where the growth happens. And if they throw in a video library for after-hours studying? Bonus points.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-mentorship-thats-actually-useful\">2. Mentorship That’s Actually Useful</h3>\n<p>A true mentor doesn’t just sit near you and hope you learn by osmosis. The best real estate brokerages for new agents match you with someone who actually has time to answer questions, offer feedback, and walk you through awkward scenarios (like what to say when your buyer suddenly wants to “think about it” mid-escrow).</p>\n<p>Ask if the mentorship is structured &#8211; how often you meet, what’s covered, and how mentors are selected. Vague “you’ll have support” promises are a red flag. You need someone who can spot your blind spots and help you build your skills, not just collect a fee on your closings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-supportive-company-culture\">3. Supportive Company Culture</h3>\n<p>New agents fail most often because they feel isolated and overwhelmed. That’s where company culture comes in.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>A supportive brokerage means open-door managers, collaborative agents, tech help that actually shows up, and a place where asking questions isn’t treated like a weakness. Culture shows up in little things &#8211; who’s willing to share scripts, who answers your Slack messages, and whether there’s a community that makes you feel like you’re not doing this alone.</p>\n<p>Before you join, talk to other agents. Ask what support really looks like. You’ll feel the vibe pretty quickly.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/68350a35c1e41374-Synergstic-Community-2.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty Team Synergistic Community 2\" class=\"wp-image-263072 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Synergstic-Community-2.webp 450w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Synergstic-Community-2-300x200.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-tech-that-works-and-helps\">4. Tech That Works (And Helps)</h3>\n<p>Modern real estate runs on systems. Your brokerage should give you access to tools like a solid CRM, digital marketing tools, and listing tech that doesn’t look like it’s from 2005.</p>\n<p>At minimum, look for:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>CRM with follow-up automation (like <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/boldtrail/\">Boldtrai</a>l or similar)</li>\n<li>Email and text drips</li>\n<li>Social media content tools</li>\n<li>eSign and <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/skyslope/\">transaction management systems</a></li>\n<li>Virtual office platforms for training and collaboration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why? Because tech that works means less time in paperwork purgatory and more time closing deals &#8211; or, let’s be honest, generating leads to get there.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-lead-generation-support\">5. Lead Generation Support</h3>\n<p>Leads are the lifeline of a new agent’s business. The best real estate companies for new agents don’t just say “go find clients” &#8211; they help you do it (like <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/revenos-leads/\">Revenos</a> at eXp).</p>\n<p>That could mean PPC ads, relocation referrals, open house strategies, or sphere marketing tools. Some brokerages offer leads directly, others coach you on how to generate and convert them. The key is understanding what systems are in place &#8211; and what’s expected of you to make them work.</p>\n<p>Ask: Are leads provided? Is there training on conversion? And do I pay extra for them?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-long-term-growth-opportunities\">6. Long-Term Growth Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Yes, it’s about closing your first deal &#8211; but it’s also about what happens after deal #10. The best real estate brokerage firms for beginners also help you plan your next chapter.</p>\n<p>That might mean:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Coaching to scale into a team leader role</li>\n<li>Management tracks or specialist positions</li>\n<li>Continued education (marketing, negotiation, compliance)</li>\n<li>Conferences, masterminds, and skill-building events</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your brokerage only focuses on the next deal, they’re not planning for your future. Ask about growth paths before you join.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"choose-the-brokerage-that-sets-you-up-to-win\">Choose the Brokerage That Sets You Up to Win</h2>\n<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer to the best real estate brokerage for new agents &#8211; but there is one universal truth: support matters more than hype. You need a brokerage that actually trains you, supports you when you&#8217;re stuck, and helps you grow beyond just your first deal. We’ve got way more info to help you <a href=\"/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">compare what different brokerages actually offer</a> and most of it is nearly impossible to find through basic online searches.</p>\n<p>Speaking of brokerages…</p>\n<p>When you choose <a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/smart-agent-alliance/\">Smart Agent Alliance</a> as your sponsor at eXp Realty, you don’t just get the most agent-forward brokerage in the game.

    "content": "<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong>eXp onboarding is a structured, time-bound process designed to activate agents quickly while protecting compliance and licensing accuracy. The biggest variable is not the platform itself, it is sponsor selection and preparation before submitting the application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tl-dr-about-e-xp-onboarding-at-e-xp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TL;DR About eXp Onboarding at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>eXp onboarding follows a defined 8-day Quick Start process</li>\n<li>Sponsor selection is permanent once the application is submitted</li>\n<li>License transfer typically completes within 2–4 business days</li>\n<li>Core tools and systems are introduced gradually, not all at once</li>\n<li>Co-sponsors are optional and limited to individual support only</li>\n<li>Strong sponsor ecosystems simplify onboarding and reduce friction</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Onboarding at eXp Realty is not complicated, but it is unforgiving if you rush key decisions. The process is designed to move agents from approval to production quickly, with standardized steps for licensing, systems access, and compliance. What trips agents up is skipping preparation, misunderstanding sponsor roles, or assuming changes can be made later.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This article explains how eXp onboarding fits into the broader <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/support/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty support ecosystem</a> available to eXp agents. Here’s your handy dandy index:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"#tl-dr-about-e-xp-onboarding-at-e-xp-realty\">TL;DR About eXp Onboarding at eXp Realty</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"#is-e-xp-onboarding-difficult-for-new-agents\">Is eXp onboarding difficult for new agents?</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"#can-mistakes-be-fixed-after-submitting-the-join-e-xp-application\">Can mistakes be fixed after submitting the Join eXp application?</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"#how-does-e-xp-onboarding-compare-to-traditional-brokerages\">How does eXp onboarding compare to traditional brokerages?</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"#faq-question-1752692560860\">How long does eXp onboarding usually take?</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"#faq-question-1752692567656\">Is eXp onboarding mandatory for all agents?</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"#faq-question-1752692574579\">Can I change my sponsor after onboarding is complete?</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"#faq-question-1752692592353\">What role does the mentor program play during onboarding?</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-expect-with-e-xp-realty-onboarding\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Expect with eXp Realty Onboarding</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp onboarding is built like a factory line &#8211; but in a good way. Fast, clean, and surprisingly functional. It’s designed to help eXp agents get fully equipped with the tools, training, and support needed to start buying and selling homes fast (translation: get paid sooner).</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if you walk in blind without knowing how it works? You could be in for a world of confusion &#8211; and maybe even regret.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So let’s break it down. <strong>Here’s a recap of the 6 key eXp Realty onboarding steps we’ll cover in detail below:</strong></p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pick a Sponsor</li>\n<li>Fill out the Join eXp Application</li>\n<li>Wait for Active Status</li>\n<li>Receive Sponsor Value</li>\n<li>Optional Co-Sponsor</li>\n<li>eXp’s Official 8 Day Onboarding Kicks Off</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"step-1-pick-a-sponsor-carefully-seriously\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Pick a Sponsor (Carefully. Seriously.)</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If we sound like a broken record here, good. Because picking your <a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/basics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp sponsor</a> is the most important decision you’ll make outside of “should I become a real estate agent in the first place?”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s why: most eXp Realty agents never realize how much sponsor support varies until it’s too late – and then they have <a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/sponsor-regrets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">agent sponsor regrets</a>. Most eXp sponsors offer nothing. Others, like Smart Agent Alliance, offer an entire ecosystem of tools, mentorship, training, marketing help, and production support. We’re talking real support &#8211; not “give me a call if you need something.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6b988448e136383c-eXp-Onboarding-Step-1-Pick-a-Sponsor.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Onboarding Step 1, Pick a Sponsor\" class=\"wp-image-268703 size-full\" width=\"499\" height=\"282\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eXp-Onboarding-Step-1-Pick-a-Sponsor.webp 499w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eXp-Onboarding-Step-1-Pick-a-Sponsor-480x271.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 499px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Pro tip: This sponsor choice includes the sponsor you name and their full upline of 6 more agents.&nbsp; So, don’t blow this. Choose a sponsor who’s part of a strong upline team. Lone-wolf agents can’t give you the kind of leverage that team sponsors with layers of support (like us) can. It&#8217;s the difference between plugging into a system… or being left Googling “how to get started as a real estate agent” at 1 a.m.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quick heads-up on common confusion:<br />Your eXp sponsor is <em>not</em> the same as a production team leader or mentor. Some agents make this confusing on purpose (shocker), especially if they’ve built a fancy site around their local production team.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s the breakdown:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sponsor teams – You must name them when you apply to eXp. They offer various levels of agent support (ranging from “literally nothing” to “why didn’t I join this sooner?”). They cost you $0.</li>\n<li>Production teams – You join them anytime after you’re an active eXp agent. They’re great for day-to-day transaction help &#8211; but they take 25%+ of your commission.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"step-2-fill-out-the-join-e-xp-application\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Fill Out the Join eXp Application</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once you’ve picked your sponsor (hi, hopefully us), you’ll go to the Join eXp application. Here’s what happens next:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 44%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>First, if you have any trouble with your application, reach out to eXpert Care at 833-303-0610 or contact your sponsor.</li>\n<li>Access the <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official Join Us</a> platform through eXp’s website.</li>\n<li>Fill it out completely. Double-check that your name matches your real estate license exactly.</li>\n<li>Name your sponsor (don’t skip this &#8211; if you leave it blank, you don’t get a do-over.)</li>\n<li>Set up direct deposit and upload your W-9</li>\n<li>Read and sign your Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) – this defines your business relationship with eXp Realty.

Instead:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ask your sponsor for an <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/exp-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp World pass</a> – take a tour, click around</li>\n<li>Get your <strong>professional photos</strong> done – you’ll need them for your marketing</li>\n<li>Haven’t heard anything from eXp in 4 days? Call <strong>eXpert Care</strong> (833-303-0610) and ask to speak to onboarding.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"step-4-receive-sponsor-value\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Receive Sponsor Value</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Congrats &#8211; you’re now an active <strong>eXp Realty agent</strong>. This is where it gets real.<br />If you chose a sponsor who actually delivers (like Smart Agent Alliance), this is when the good stuff kicks in &#8211; and it’s all free:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Private 1-on-1 onboarding call</li>\n<li>Production help with top courses and live tips</li>\n<li>Revenue share support for passive income</li>\n<li>Community, connection, motivation, inspiration</li>\n<li>Access to training, tools, and templates</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/c3658cfa33f6e228-Step-4-Receive-Sponsor-Value.webp/public\" alt=\"Step 4, Receive Sponsor Value\" class=\"wp-image-268706 size-full\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Step-4-Receive-Sponsor-Value.webp 500w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Step-4-Receive-Sponsor-Value-480x273.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 500px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if your sponsor ghosted you… or you didn’t realize that naming a sponsor on your application locked in your access to a full <strong>upline team</strong> and not just one person, yeah &#8211; it stings.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The good news? You’re not completely out of luck. You still have one more card to play: the <strong>co-sponsor</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-5-optional-co-sponsor\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 5: Optional Co-Sponsor</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You have 5 days from the date you become active to name a co-sponsor if you choose to. This step is entirely optional, and in many cases, skipping a co-sponsor is the smarter long-term move.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A co-sponsor is a second, individual layer of support, not a replacement for your primary sponsor or their upline. Co-sponsors do not provide a full team structure, and they do not expand your revenue share tree. In fact, adding a co-sponsor when you don’t truly need one can limit future revenue share growth, especially if you later plan to build passive income through agent attraction.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Co-sponsorship only makes sense when there is a specific, short-term gap your primary sponsor team cannot fill, such as a highly localized need or a niche skillset. If that gap does not clearly exist, naming a co-sponsor often adds complexity without upside.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If you do decide to name one, choose carefully. Use the eXp directory to find someone aligned with your goals, then speak with them directly. Be clear about what support they will actually provide, at no cost. Giving away part of your future upside to someone who adds no measurable value is not strategy, it’s preventable regret.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-6-e-xps-onboarding-day-1-to-day-8-tasks\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 6: The Official eXp Onboarding Experience</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once you are active, eXp onboarding is centered around a two-hour live onboarding session, followed by a second live or on-demand session designed to help agents understand the full depth of what eXp offers and how to navigate it effectively.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The onboarding flow begins with Important Broker Tasks, including joining your local Association of Realtors, joining your MLS, and completing any mandatory training such as NAR Code of Ethics requirements. These items are required for compliance and must be completed before production begins. Questions at this stage are handled by your State Broker Team.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From there, agents are introduced to the Quick Startup Guide, which organizes the onboarding experience into clear steps. Key components include:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Live onboarding sessions, where agents can ask questions in real time and understand how the platform fits together</li>\n<li>eXp University: New to eXp Agent Training Roadmap, which outlines foundational training paths based on experience level</li>\n<li>Review and selection of your CRM of choice, allowing agents to activate systems intentionally instead of by default</li>\n<li>Ordering the free New eXp Agent Starter Kit, which provides physical and digital materials for early setup</li>\n<li>Access to the Training and Events Calendar, showing live classes, onboarding sessions, and ongoing education</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal of this updated onboarding model is still functional readiness, not mastery, but it achieves that through live orientation and guided decision-making instead of forcing agents to configure every tool immediately. Agents are expected to understand what eXp provides, how to access support, and which systems matter now versus later, while continuing to deepen their knowledge after onboarding is complete.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ready-to-make-your-onboarding-count\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About eXp Onboarding</h2>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-onboarding-difficult-for-new-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is eXp onboarding difficult for new agents?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The process itself is structured and predictable. Difficulty usually comes from unfamiliar terminology or unclear sponsor guidance. New agents who follow the checklist and ask questions through official support channels typically complete onboarding without major issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-mistakes-be-fixed-after-submitting-the-join-e-xp-application\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Can mistakes be fixed after submitting the Join eXp application?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some errors can be corrected, but sponsor selection usually cannot without a clear agent mistake that is not quickly corrected. This is why preparation to choose a sponsor before submission matters. Administrative corrections may delay activation, while sponsorship errors are usually permanent once the application is finalized.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-e-xp-onboarding-compare-to-traditional-brokerages\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does eXp onboarding compare to traditional brokerages?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional brokerages often rely on local offices and manual steps. eXp centralizes onboarding, allowing faster activation and consistent processes across markets. The trade-off is that agents must be more deliberate upfront, since changes later are limited.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-this-matters-before-you-join-e-xp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Support like eXp onboarding is designed to help agents transition into the brokerage smoothly, but it does not operate independently or replace the broader eXp Realty platform.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752692560860\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">How long does eXp onboarding usually take?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Most agents become active within one to four business days after application approval, depending on state license transfer speed. After activation, onboarding is delivered through a 2 hour live sessions, followed by guided setup using the Quick Startup Guide. Agents can begin production once required broker and licensing tasks are complete, while continuing optional training afterward.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752692567656\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is eXp onboarding mandatory for all agents?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. All agents must complete required onboarding steps related to licensing, compliance, and system access. Optional tools and programs introduced during onboarding are not mandatory and can be explored later.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752692574579\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Can I change my sponsor after onboarding is complete?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Sponsor selection is usually permanent once the Join eXp application is submitted. Agents may name an optional co-sponsor within five days of activation, but this does not replace the primary sponsor or their upline.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752692592353\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What role does the mentor program play during onboarding?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Agents with fewer than three closed transactions in the prior twelve months are automatically assigned a certified mentor. Mentor guidance focuses on early transaction execution and compliance, not long-term business coaching.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"related-e-xp-realty-support\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related eXp Realty Support Guides</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/onboarding-exceptions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How eXp Helps Agents Before They Ever Join</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/agent-exceptions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How eXp Realty Agent Exceptions Help After Agents Join</a></p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/agent-help/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How eXp Realty Agent Help Really Works</a></p>\n",
