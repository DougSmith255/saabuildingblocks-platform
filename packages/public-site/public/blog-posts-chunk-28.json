Your brokerage affects everything from your day-to-day work experience to the level of support you’ll get, and how easily you can grow your business. Ultimately, you want a brokerage that fits your career goals and makes financial sense.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing eXp Realty and The Agency. We’ll look at their commission splits, fees, training, support, and what agents say about working there. And, note, that while eXp Realty is super transparent with its structure, The Agency operates in a more traditional way, where information isn’t always as clear. Don’t worry, we’ve done the digging for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s start by looking at agent satisfaction—because happy agents tend to stick around longer and perform better. According to Glassdoor reviews, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands strong with a <strong>4.6 star rating</strong>, while <strong>The Agency</strong> isn’t far behind with <strong>4.1 star rating</strong>.</p>\n<p>These reviews give insight into how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience at each company.

Why should you care? Because a financially stable brokerage is more likely to invest in its agents, offering better tools, support, and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at <strong>The Agency</strong>. Unfortunately, <strong>they don’t have publicly listed stock</strong>, so their profitability isn’t transparent. This leaves you in the dark about how well the company is doing financially, which is something to keep in mind when considering the long-term stability of the brokerage.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>—meaning they’ve been <strong>profitable 75% of the time</strong>. Even better, <strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years</strong>.</p>\n<p>This financial stability translates into continuous improvements for both agents and clients, ensuring you have access to cutting-edge tools, tech, and support without worrying about surprise changes that could affect your income.

At <strong>The Agency</strong>, splits typically range from <strong>70/30</strong> to <strong>90/10.</strong> Like many traditional brokerages, it depends on the office and what deal you negotiate. So, you’ll want to ask about this when you’re interviewing.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, things are much simpler and transparent. Agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp offers additional stock options for agents who hit specific milestones—meaning you can actually earn <strong>more than 100% commission </strong>each year. For new agents or seasoned pros, everyone at eXp Realty gets the same deal, no haggling required.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is a must-have for protecting both agents and the brokerage from legal claims. Let’s see how the costs compare between eXp Realty and The Agency.</p>\n<p>At <strong>The Agency</strong>, agents are charged <strong>$1,900</strong> <strong>annually</strong> for E&#038;O insurance, and from what we’ve gathered, this fee is often due upfront, even before you’ve closed any deals.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the E&#038;O insurance structure is more agent-friendly. Agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and once you hit <strong>$750</strong> in total for the year, you don’t pay anything more—no matter how many deals you close.</p>\n<p>This setup is much easier on your budget, especially if you’re just starting out and don’t want to pay hefty fees before making any money.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really take a bite out of your earnings, so let’s break down the costs at eXp Realty and The Agency. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, you’ll pay a manageable <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong>, plus a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until you hit your cap. That’s it—clear and simple.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>The Agency</strong> has fees that <strong>vary by office</strong>. Monthly fees can fluctuate significantly, and on top of that, there’s a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> charged on each transaction. These fees can add up quickly, especially when combined with commission splits, so make sure to ask about the specifics at your local office.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>training</strong> and <strong>support</strong>, the quality and availability can make a huge difference in your career, whether you’re a brand-new agent or a seasoned pro.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> excels in this area, offering more than <strong>50 live training sessions each week</strong>, along with a robust <strong>on-demand course library</strong>.</p>\n<p>For new agents, the <strong>Fast Start</strong> <strong>program</strong> helps you get up to speed quickly, while the <strong>Kick Start</strong> <strong>program</strong> is designed to take experienced agents to the next level. Plus, eXp Realty offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> available to help when you need it.</p>\n<p>At <strong>The Agency</strong>, training and support <strong>vary by office</strong>. Some locations offer more resources than others, but there’s no consistent standard.</p>\n<p>The same goes for support—your experience will largely <strong>depend on your local broker’s availability</strong>, which can be a drawback if you need help outside of regular business hours. If reliable, around-the-clock support is important to you, eXp Realty has a significant edge.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Technology can make a big difference in how efficiently you can run your real estate business, so let’s see what each brokerage offers.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out with its fully virtual brokerage model, which includes <strong>eXp World</strong>—a metaverse-like platform where agents can meet with brokers, get tech support, attend training, and collaborate with other agents, all from the comfort of their home. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Beyond that, eXp Realty provides agents with a <strong>personal IDX website</strong>, <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> packed with customizable templates and social media content. And eXp Realty is always updating its tech to stay ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p>As for <strong>The Agency</strong>, there isn’t a lot of information about their tech offerings. So ask at your local office.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-the-agency-may-be-best-for-you\">Why The Agency May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>While<a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> eXp Realty</a> has plenty to offer, The Agency could still be the right fit for agents who prefer a traditional brokerage with physical offices. If you’re someone who thrives on in-person interactions and prefers having an office broker keep tabs on your productivity, The Agency might feel more like home.</p>\n<p>If you’re simply looking for out-of-home office space, <strong>eXp Realty offers FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide</strong>. However, if you prefer a structured environment with a local broker checking in daily, The Agency might suit your style better.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t provide. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry. And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp.</p>\n<p>The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>In the end, the decision between <strong>eXp Realty</strong> and <strong>The Agency</strong> comes down to what you’re looking for in a brokerage. <strong>The Agency</strong> offers a more traditional experience with physical offices and in-person support, but higher fees and inconsistent training could be downsides.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out with <strong>transparent splits</strong>, lower fees, advanced tech, and <strong>24/7 support</strong>—making it a strong option for agents who want flexibility, growth potential, and the ability to keep more of their commissions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Your brokerage choice shapes your everyday experience, the support you receive, and the resources available to grow your business.</p>\n<p>You want a brokerage that aligns with your goals, supports your success, helps you keep more of your hard-earned money and, of course, leaves you feeling super stoked about your choice.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing eXp Realty and <a href=\"https://www.bhhs.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</a>—two well-known names in real estate. We’ll take a close look at commission splits, fees, training opportunities, and agent satisfaction.</p>\n<p>eXp <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/about-exp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> is super transparent about this information, but it takes digging to fully understand what Berkshire Hathaway offers. Luckily for you, we’ve done the research, so you don’t have to.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s start with agent satisfaction—because if agents are happy, they’re more likely to succeed. Based on Glassdoor reviews, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> scores a solid <strong>4.6 stars</strong>, while <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> comes in slightly lower at <strong>4.4 stars</strong>.</p>\n<p>This gives you a peek into how agents feel about their overall experience at each company, including support and resources.

A financially stable brokerage is less likely to make sudden changes that could hurt your business.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is one of the many companies under the <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Berkshire Hathaway umbrella</a>. However, we can’t find any broken out financial performance of the HomeServices division in Berkshire Hathaway’s public filings. So while Berkshire Hathaway as a whole is profitable, we don’t know whether HomeServices itself is generating a profit or running at a loss.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 15 profitable quarters, putting them at <strong>75% profitability</strong>. And even better—<strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years.</strong></p>\n<p>That kind of financial stability leads to continuous improvements for agents and clients alike.

At Berkshire Hathaway, commission splits range from 60/40 to 93/7. This is often negotiated between the agent and office, so it’s important to ask for specifics during your interview.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the commission splits are refreshingly simple and transparent. Agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>And with eXp, there’s no negotiation or confusion—every agent gets the same deal. Plus, eXp offers stock options for agents who hit certain milestones, so you can actually earn <strong>more than 100%</strong> of your commissions each year. Whether you’re a new agent or a top producer, the playing field is level at eXp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Now let’s talk about <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/errors-omissions-eo-insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance</a>. This is crucial for protecting both you and your brokerage from potential legal claims.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, the details about E&#038;O insurance are not widely shared, and it seems to <strong>vary by office</strong>. From what we’ve gathered, these costs can be substantial, so you’ll want to check with your local office to understand what you’ll be expected to pay.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and once you hit <strong>$750</strong> for the year, your E&#038;O fees stop. No more payments, no matter how many deals you close. This is a huge advantage, especially if you’re just starting out or want to keep more of your income in your pocket.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really add up, so let’s break down what to expect from eXp Realty and Berkshire Hathaway. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay a straightforward <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong>, and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until you hit your cap. Pretty simple, right?</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, things are more complicated. Monthly fees can range from <strong>$295 to</strong> <strong>$625</strong> per transaction, depending on your office. Plus, there’s a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> on each transaction, which can really start to add up. When you compare the two, eXp Realty offers a more predictable and cost-effective fee structure, which helps agents keep more of their earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Training and support are key for both new agents and seasoned pros. Let’s see how these brokerages stack up. At <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/training\">eXp Realty</a>, you’ll have access to over 50 live training sessions every week, along with a massive on-demand library of courses.</p>\n<p>For new agents, the <strong>Fast Start program</strong> is designed to help you hit the ground running, while experienced agents can level up with the <strong>Kick Start program</strong>. And with <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff</strong> members available to assist you, you’re never left hanging when you need help.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, the training and support<strong> vary by office</strong>. Some offices might offer great resources, while others could leave you wanting more. Your experience will largely depend on your local office broker’s availability, which means you might not always have the support you need at crucial moments.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Having the right technology can make or break your real estate business, so let’s see how eXp Realty and Berkshire Hathaway compare.</p>\n<p>eXp Realty is at the forefront of tech innovation with its fully virtual brokerage model. Agents work in eXp World, a metaverse-like platform where you can meet with brokers, get tech support, and attend training sessions. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/exp-world\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp Realty provides agents with a personal <strong>IDX website</strong>, not just a page on your brokerage’s website, a powerful <strong>CRM &#038; Lead Generator Tool</strong>, a <strong>Marketing Center</strong> filled with customizable templates and social media content, and more. And with eXp, the tech keeps evolving to help you stay ahead of the competition.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, we found <strong>no information</strong> about their technology and resources. Not sure why, but it seems like a bad thing that no one is talking about it. If having access to cutting-edge tools and resources is crucial to your success, eXp Realty is the clear leader here.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-berkshire-hathaway-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Berkshire Hathaway May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>While eXp Realty offers tons of benefits, Berkshire Hathaway may be the better fit if you prefer a traditional brokerage with physical offices. If you enjoy the structure of an office environment or need to have a local broker for face-to-face support and to crack the whip to get you moving, Berkshire Hathaway could be the right place for you.</p>\n<p>But if you’re just looking for out-of-home office space, eXp Realty provides FREE access to over <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/offices\">4,000 Regus office business lounges</a> around the world. But if you thrive in a more structured setting with daily in-person accountability, Berkshire Hathaway might feel more like home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>On top of everything else, eXp Realty offers a range of features that most other brokerages simply don’t. For luxury agents, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/luxury\">eXp’s Luxury Division </a>allows you to advertise your high-end listings globally, giving you top-tier exposure.</p>\n<p>They also have a dedicated staff called<a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenous-leads\"> Revenos</a>, whose sole job is to find and provide quality leads directly to eXp agents—how cool is that? Their Referral tool makes it easy for agents to pass referrals to others with just a few clicks, and if you’re only interested in running a referral business, eXp’s Referral Division lowers costs while keeping you in the game.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget about <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share\">Revenue Share</a>, which offers agents a way to earn income by recommending other agents to join eXp. That income doesn’t stop when you retire and it’s willable, meaning it keeps giving even after you’re out of the game. Talk about a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>When it comes to choosing between <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>eXp Realty</strong></a> and <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, it really depends on what you’re looking for in a brokerage. <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> offers the traditional, in-office experience with a solid reputation, but with higher fees and inconsistent training.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> gives you <strong>transparent splits</strong>, lower fees, cutting-edge tech, and <strong>24/7 support</strong>—making it a fantastic option for agents looking for flexibility, growth, and the chance to keep more of their hard-earned commissions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Smart Agent Alliance: The Sponsor Team That Works for Your Revenue Share</h2>\n<p>Most agents don’t join eXp for the <a href=\"https://cthulhu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/karrie_karriehill_com/Documents/Desktop/SAA%20Share/SAA%20Blogs/Revenue%20share%202.0:%20https:/smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/revenue-share/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revenue share</a> passive income, but once they see the potential, they wish they had our resources and support.

But your brokerage also shapes your day-to-day experience, determines how much support you get, and dictates the resources you can access to grow your business. You need to choose a brokerage that helps you succeed while ensuring your bottom line stays healthy.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing eXp Realty and Coldwell Banker—two prominent names in real estate. We’ll explore everything from commission splits and fees to the level of training and agent satisfaction at each brokerage.</p>\n<p>With eXp Realty, all the information is easily accessible, but with Coldwell Banker, we had to do some digging to find out what agents experience. No worries, we’ve got you covered.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s start by looking at how happy agents are at both brokerages. According to Glassdoor, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands strong with a <strong>4.6-star rating</strong>, while <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> also holds up well with a <strong>4.3-star rating</strong>. These ratings give a snapshot of how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience at each company.</p>\n<p>And as we all know, agents who are satisfied with their brokerage tend to be more successful.  If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why should you care if your brokerage is making money? Because a profitable brokerage has the financial stability to offer better tools, resources, and fewer surprise changes that could hurt you or your clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> is part of Anywhere Real Estate, which also owns big names like Sotheby’s, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Century 21, and Corcoran. Anywhere has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 8 unprofitable quarters. That gives it a <strong>60% profitability</strong> rate—not bad, but there’s definitely room for improvement.</p>\n<p>Now let’s look at <strong>eXp Realty</strong>. They’ve posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, and 15 of those have been profitable, giving them a <strong>75% profitability</strong> rate. What’s more, eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable over the past five years.</p>\n<p>That stability translates to continuous improvements for both agents and clients. When you work at a brokerage that’s making money, they can afford to reinvest in their agents with better tools, training, and tech.

Our research shows that the actual numbers vary a lot, so make sure to ask for specifics when you interview.</p>\n<p>Now, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is refreshingly simple. Every agent starts at an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000 to eXp</strong> in the year, you cap, meaning you keep <strong>100% </strong>of your commissions after that. There’s no negotiating for a better split—every agent gets the same deal, whether you’re new or a seasoned pro.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp offers opportunities to <strong>earn stock</strong>. You get company stock for hitting certain milestones, and if you hit additional goals after capping, you can earn your <strong>$16,000 cap back in stock</strong>. That’s how some agents actually earn more than 100% of their commission each year. Nice!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is a must-have for agents, but how brokerages handle this cost varies. At <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong>, agents pay around <strong>$300 per month</strong> for E&#038;O insurance. Whether that’s upfront or paid over time depends on the office, but that’s a significant cost no matter how you slice it.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, E&#038;O insurance is a lot more manageable. Agents only pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and eXp caps those fees at <strong>$750</strong> annually. So once you’ve paid $750 in E&#038;O for the year, you’re done. You won’t have to pay another penny, no matter how many deals you close. That’s a huge benefit for agents who are just getting started and don’t want to be burdened with hefty upfront costs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees are another critical consideration, and Coldwell Banker and eXp Realty handle them quite differently.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the fee structure is straightforward. Agents pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and <strong>$25 per transaction</strong> until they hit their cap. It’s predictable, easy to understand, and there are no surprises.</p>\n<p><strong>Coldwell Banker’s</strong> fees, however, vary greatly depending on the office. Agents can expect to pay between <strong>$122 &#8211; $350 per month</strong> just to stay on board, and there’s also a <strong>5% to 6.5% royalty fee</strong> charged per transaction. These fees can really add up and take a bigger chunk out of your earnings compared to <strong>eXp’s</strong> much simpler structure.</p>\n<p>Between the clear fee structure at eXp and the variable, sometimes high, costs at Coldwell Banker, eXp Realty definitely offers a more agent-friendly deal when it comes to fees.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Next up is training and support, which are crucial to helping agents, whether new or experienced, succeed.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training opportunities are top-notch. With over <strong>50 live training sessions every week</strong>, plus a full library of <strong>on-demand courses</strong>, there’s always something to help you improve. eXp also has programs like <strong>Fast Start</strong> for new agents who want to get going fast, and <strong>Kick Start</strong> for experienced agents looking to take their business to the next level.</p>\n<p>On top of all that, eXp provides <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> to assist you with your needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Coldwell Banker</strong>, on the other hand, <strong>doesn’t offer a standardized training program</strong> across all offices. Training varies depending on where you’re located and what your office offers. That’s also true for agent support—it’s heavily reliant on the office broker, meaning your experience can vary depending on how available or helpful your broker is.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to tech, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out from the crowd. They’ve built a fully virtual brokerage, and agents can do everything from meeting with brokers to attending training sessions in <strong>eXp World</strong>, their online metaverse-style platform. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Beyond that, eXp agents get access to an <strong>IDX website</strong>, a <strong>CRM</strong> called <strong>kvCORE</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> with customizable templates, social media content, and more. eXp is constantly adding new tech tools to help agents stay ahead of the game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we couldn’t dig up too much information about what <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> offers in terms of tech. It’s <strong>unclear if they have any standard tools </strong>across offices, so ask about that during your Coldwell Banker interview.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-coldwell-banker-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Coldwell Banker May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>If you’re someone who likes a more traditional office environment with face-to-face interactions and you prefer having a local office broker for day-to-day support, Coldwell Banker could be a better fit. They’ve got a long-standing reputation and strong branding, and for some agents, having that in-person accountability is key to their success.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out-of-home office space, <strong>eXp Realty provides FREE access to the 4,000 Regus office business lounges</strong> around the world. But that won’t be enough if you’re someone who needs the structure of a physical office, with a broker cracking the whip. If that’s the case, Coldwell Banker might feel more like home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t provide. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, when comparing eXp Realty and Coldwell Banker, it comes down to what kind of environment you thrive in. Coldwell Banker has the prestige of a traditional office setting, but with higher fees and less predictable splits, it might not be the most cost-effective option.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, eXp Realty offers transparent splits, lower fees, better tech, and 24/7 support—all of which can help you keep more of your earnings and grow your business faster.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Sure, that’s a huge part of it, but the brokerage you choose also affects your day-to-day work environment, the resources you can access, and the support you’ll receive. You want a brokerage that matches your style, helps you grow, and—let’s be real—puts more money in your pocket.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re going to explore eXp Realty and Redfin. These are two very different models. We’ll break down everything from commission splits and fees to agent satisfaction and profitability.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is key to knowing how supported you’ll feel at a brokerage. According to Glassdoor, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> scores an impressive <strong>4.6 stars</strong>, while <strong>Redfin</strong> comes in at <strong>4.2 stars</strong>. Agent satisfaction often reflects the level of support, resources, and overall agent experience. And we know that when agents are happy, they’re more likely to succeed.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why should you care about brokerage profitability? Because when a brokerage is profitable, it’s more likely to invest in its agents—offering better tools, support, and training.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at <strong>Redfin</strong>. With <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, Redfin has posted <strong>17 quarters of losses</strong>, meaning they’ve only had <strong>15% profitability </strong>rate. Ouch. Financial instability like that often leads to cost-cutting measures that can hurt agents and their clients.</p>\n<p>In comparison, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with only <strong>5 quarters of losses</strong>, which gives them a <strong>75% profitability </strong>rate. And get this—<strong>eXp Realty</strong> is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the past five years.</p>\n<p>That kind of financial strength is a big deal because it means continuous improvements for both agents and clients, without cutting corners.

You can choose an <strong>up to 40/60 </strong>split and Redfin will provide your leads or an <strong>up to 75/25 </strong>split and you find your own leads.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear what situation results in a lower pay than 40/60 and 75/25, but clearly the words “up to” imply their splits can be lower. Anyway, these splits are fairly new as Redfin recently ended their model that paid agent salaries. We’re guessing Redfin’s low profitability motivated the change.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, it’s straightforward. Every agent starts with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Plus, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> rewards agents with stock for hitting certain milestones, and if you meet additional goals, you can even get your <strong>$16,000 cap back in company stock</strong>. That means agents can earn <strong>more than 100% commission</strong> each year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Fees</h2>\n<p><strong>Fees</strong> can eat into your earnings if you’re not careful, so let’s compare how they stack up between these two brokerages.</p>\n<p><strong>Redfin</strong> takes a different approach. Redfin takes a <strong>bigger bite out of your commission</strong> and covers your fees and some other business expenses that agents typically incur like MLS dues, association fees, mileage, cell phone plan, training, development, sales coaching, and more.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, you pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until you hit your cap. For E&#038;O insurance, you pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but only when you close a deal. And here’s the best part—once you hit <strong>$750</strong> for the year, you’re done paying E&#038;O insurance.</p>\n<p>While eXp Realty does not cover all the fees that Redfin does, having a 80/20 split that goes up to 100% when you cap instead of Redfin’s much lower splits leaves agents taking home more money. Plus, eXp agents do get all the training, development, sales coaching they could possibly need at no additional fee.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned pro, training and support are crucial to your success. Let’s see what each brokerage offers in this department.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents have access to <strong>50+ live training sessions every week</strong>, an <strong>on-demand library</strong>, and programs like <strong>Fast Start</strong> for new agents and <strong>Kick Start</strong> for experienced agents. Plus, you get <strong>24/7 support</strong> and help from over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong>. That’s a huge bonus because it means you’re never left hanging when you need help.</p>\n<p><strong>Redfin</strong> offers <strong>4 weeks of local training</strong>, which is a decent start for new agents. However, beyond that initial training, the level of <strong>support varies</strong> depending on the office broker. So, if you need help outside of standard hours or want more ongoing training, you might find yourself waiting for someone to be available.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In today’s real estate world, having the right tech can make or break your business. Let’s see how these two brokerages stack up in terms of technology and resources.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> is known for being a fully virtual brokerage. With <strong>eXp World</strong>, agents can meet with their brokers, get tech support, attend training, and collaborate with other agents—all in a metaverse-style environment. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p> On top of that, eXp Realty provides agents with their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a powerful <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> with customizable templates for social media, flyers, and so much more.</p>\n<p>The details on <strong>Redfin</strong>’s technology and resources are a bit harder to come by. They’re known for their <strong>consumer-facing website</strong>, which is popular with buyers and sellers, but when it comes to tools for agents, it’s not as clear. There’s no virtual platform like eXp World, so if cutting-edge tech is something you value, eXp Realty is the better choice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-redfin-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Redfin May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>While eXp Realty offers a ton of value, Redfin still has its appeal, especially if you’re someone who values stability and enjoys a more traditional real estate model.</p>\n<p>Redfin’s salary option offers consistency that might be appealing to agents who want a guaranteed paycheck, even if it comes with a lower commission split. Plus, if you prefer working in a more structured environment, where someone is in charge of keeping you on track, Redfin’s office-based approach could be a better fit for you.</p>\n<p>That said, <strong>eXp Realty does provide FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide.</strong> But if you thrive on having a salaried position with a traditional brokerage structure, Redfin might be the better option for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248129\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources.png\" alt=\"a yellow diamond on a white background\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources.png 256w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t have. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry. And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working.

With eXp Realty, everything is laid out clearly, but with Century 21, we had to do some digging to get all the details.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Century 21: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s kick things off by checking how happy agents are at each brokerage—because if the agents are satisfied, that’s a good sign. On Glassdoor, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds a solid <strong>4.6-star rating</strong>, while <strong>Century 21</strong> comes in at <strong>4.2 stars</strong>.</p>\n<p>Agent reviews often reflect how much support they’re getting, the resources available, and whether the brokerage sets them up for success.

Because a brokerage that’s financially stable is less likely to make cuts that could hurt you or your clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Century 21</strong> is part of Anywhere Real Estate, which also includes Sotheby’s, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Berkshire Hathaway, and Corcoran. Anywhere has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 12 quarters of profits, so they’ve been <strong>profitable 60% </strong>of the time.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong>, on the other hand, has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 15 quarters of profits, meaning they’ve been <strong>profitable 75% </strong>of the time. And <strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years.</strong> This financial stability leads to consistent improvements for agents and clients alike.</p>\n<p>So if you’re looking for a brokerage that’s not only growing but also reinvesting in its agents, eXp Realty is the clear winner.

At <strong>Century 21</strong>, commission splits range from <strong>70/30</strong> to <strong>92/8</strong>, and some offices may offer a cap, typically around <strong>$22,500</strong>, but you’ll need to check with your local office because, like many traditional brokerages, the split can vary depending on the office and the deal you negotiate.</p>\n<p>Over at <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the splits are straightforward. Every agent starts with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp Realty rewards agents with stock for hitting certain milestones, so you can earn even <strong>more than 100%.</strong> And what’s great is that eXp Realty offers the same split to every agent, no matter where you’re located—no haggling or mystery. It’s just transparent and fair across the board.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Century 21: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Next up, Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance—a must-have for every agent, as it protects both you and your brokerage from potential legal claims.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Century 21</strong>, the details about E&#038;O insurance are <strong>not readily available</strong>, and costs can vary significantly by office. It’s best to check with your local office since these fees can sometimes be pretty hefty.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the E&#038;O insurance is predictable. Agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$750</strong> for the year, you’re done. After that, no more E&#038;O fees for the rest of the year, no matter how many deals you close. This is a huge advantage, especially if you’re just starting out and don’t want to deal with high upfront costs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Century 21: Fees</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about <strong>fees</strong>—because we all know they can eat into your bottom line if you’re not careful.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the fees are simple and predictable. Agents pay a <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> until they cap. Super straightforward.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Century 21</strong>, the fees are more varied. Depending on the office, agents could pay anywhere from <strong>$0 to $350</strong> per month, plus there’s a <strong>6% to 7% royalty fee</strong> due per transaction. In some cases, agents are still required to pay that royalty fee even after capping.</p>\n<p>Plus, there are <strong>$499</strong> transaction fees in some locations. You’ll need to check with your local office for the exact numbers, but overall, <strong>Century 21’s</strong> fees can add up faster than you might expect.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Century 21: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re new or experienced, training and support are essential to your success.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, you’ve got access to <strong>50+ live training sessions</strong> every week, as well as an entire <strong>on-demand library of courses</strong>. New agents can benefit from the <strong>Fast Start</strong> <strong>program</strong>, while experienced agents can level up with the <strong>Kick Start program</strong>. And if you ever need help, eXp Realty offers <strong>24/7 support </strong>and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff </strong>members ready to assist.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Century 21</strong>, the training and support <strong>vary greatly by office</strong>. Some locations offer solid resources, while others might leave you wanting more. Your level of support really depends on how involved your local broker is, and the training is often up to the individual office.</p>\n<p>If consistent, high-quality training and 24/7 support are important to you, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> comes out on top.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Century 21: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Having the right tools can make all the difference in your real estate career, so let’s look at what these brokerages offer in terms of <strong>technology</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> leads the charge in tech innovation. With a fully virtual brokerage model, agents work in <strong>eXp World</strong>, a metaverse-like platform where you can meet with your broker, attend trainings, and get tech support.

It seems to<strong> vary by office.</strong> So if tech is a priority for you, eXp Realty has the advantage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-century-21-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Century 21 May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>While eXp Realty offers a lot of advantages, there are still reasons why Century 21 might be the right fit for you. If you’re someone who prefers a more traditional brokerage experience, with physical offices and a broker that helps keep you on track, then Century 21 could be what you’re looking for.</p>\n<p>But, if your attraction to an office is just because you want out of your house, eXp Realty does provide <strong>FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges</strong> <strong>around the globe</strong>.

If you&#8217;re not telling your brand story clearly, you&#8217;re just another face in the crowd. Make sure you&#8217;re shouting from the rooftops—well, websites and social media—what makes you the go-to agent.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just about logos and colors; it’s about weaving your unique promise into every post and page.

It&#8217;s about <strong>connecting dreams</strong> with reality. If you’re just listing specs and prices, you&#8217;re missing the heart of the business. Share your journey, the successes of your clients, and why you’re passionate about homes.

If your online voice keeps changing, it&#8217;s like wearing a disguise every time you meet someone. Avoid this real estate agent marketing mistake by using a content calendar to plan your posts, ensuring each one aligns with your brand’s voice and values.

Here’s how to tackle these common real estate agent marketing mistakes head-on:</p>\n<h3 id=\"avoid-seo-slip-ups\">Avoid SEO Slip-Ups</h3>\n<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is your best friend in the digital age, especially if you’re a real estate agent looking to get noticed. Start by peppering your website with the <strong>right keywords</strong> to climb up those Google ranks. And don’t forget, a lot of your potential clients are scrolling on their smartphones, so make sure your site looks great and functions smoothly on mobile devices too. Keep your blog fresh and filled with keyword-rich <a href=\"/the-ultimate-guide-to-crafting-a-real-estate-agent-newsletter\">real estate articles</a> to pull in more traffic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"web-design-woes\">Web Design Woes</h3>\n<p>Your website is like your <strong>online open house</strong>. Make sure it’s inviting and easy to navigate so visitors can find exactly what they need without hassle. Every page should guide them on what to do next, whether it’s calling for more info or signing up for your newsletter. Website speed is also key— a slow-loading site could make visitors bounce faster than you can say “new listing!”</p>\n<h3 id=\"underused-video-content\">Underused Video Content</h3>\n<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video must be <strong>priceless</strong>! Boost your listings with video tours to draw in buyers. Consider tapping into the power of live video on social media to engage with potential clients in real-time.</p>\n<p>Also, create helpful explainer videos for buyers and sellers to demystify the real estate process. For that, make a list of what you find yourself explaining over and over again. Customers will value your efforts, and, hey, you’ll save loads of time by not needing to constantly repeat that information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-social-media-marketing-flaws\">8. Social Media Marketing Flaws</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_241975\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-241975\" style=\"width: 990px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241975\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social-Media-Marketing-Flaws.webp\" alt=\"Person interacting with social media icons on a smartphone, illustrating real estate agent marketing mistakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"242\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social-Media-Marketing-Flaws.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social-Media-Marketing-Flaws-300x73.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social-Media-Marketing-Flaws-768x186.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-241975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Understanding common social media marketing mistakes can help real estate agents improve their online presence and engagement.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get into two super common social media real estate agent marketing mistakes that you must avoid.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quantity-vs-quality\">Quantity vs Quality</h3>\n<p>One mistake is <strong>preferring volume over value</strong> in your marketing efforts. Here’s a tip: flooding your audience with constant posts isn&#8217;t as effective as sharing genuinely impactful content intermittently.</p>\n<p>I know! We’re all trained to believe that more content is better. We fear that algorithms won’t reward our content if we aren’t putting out tons of content.</p>\n<p>But, that’s not the case. Focus on crafting content that truly resonates—like detailed guides that answer the big questions for buyers and sellers. This type of content sticks in their minds and is more likely to be shared, amplifying your reach organically.</p>\n<p>Of course, the proof is in the pudding. Always measure your efforts by tracking the return on investment (ROI). This ensures your marketing isn&#8217;t just busy work, but is genuinely building your business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"forgetting-audience-engagement\">Forgetting Audience Engagement</h3>\n<p>Now let’s jump to a classic real estate agent marketing mistake: neglecting audience engagement. I know, it can be tough. Sometimes finding your audience’s comments takes some effort because not every platform is easy to navigate. Also, sometimes the comments are negative or full of vendors wanting to sell you their wares.</p>\n<p>But, it’s important to take the time to find and read your audience’s comments and respond promptly. Turn all interactions into an opportunity to get to know the commenter and move your business forward. Here are some tips on how to make all engagement useful:</p>\n<h4 id=\"genuine-customer-comments\">Genuine Customer Comments</h4>\n<p>This is why you’re providing content. It’s what’s what you want to see. Take the time needed to respond to potential client comments thoughtfully. Craft a lengthier comment if that’s what the comment deserves. Ask questions to keep the engagement going.</p>\n<h4 id=\"haters\">Haters</h4>\n<p>Yep, eventually, we all get these. You know, those people who just can’t resist throwing out some unsolicited negativity. Don’t fear these comments or delete them. Instead, respond professionally to demonstrate who you are to your “real” prospects and to extend the engagement for algorithms to pick up and reward.</p>\n<h4 id=\"vendors\">Vendors</h4>\n<p>Yep, even those trying to sell you something can boost your algorithm gold stars. Engage with them. And here&#8217;s a little secret: your engagement can be more than just saying you’re not interested. Ask them how they specifically plan to help you. You might pick up a useful tip or two.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, no matter what type of comment, engagement shows you’re attentive and caring boosts your brand’s human touch. By avoiding this common real estate agent marketing mistake, you&#8217;ll forge deeper connections that are more likely to convert into lasting client relationships.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-overlooking-customer-insights\">7. Overlooking Customer Insights</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_241980\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-241980\" style=\"width: 990px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241980\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Overlooking-Customer-Insights.webp\" alt=\"A bright light bulb standing out among dim bulbs, representing the importance of not overlooking customer insights in real estate agent marketing mistakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"304\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Overlooking-Customer-Insights.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Overlooking-Customer-Insights-300x91.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Overlooking-Customer-Insights-768x233.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-241980\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Recognizing and acting on customer insights can drastically improve real estate marketing effectiveness.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One of the big real estate agent marketing mistakes is ignoring the <strong>gold mine found in customer feedback</strong>. When clients offer advice, smart agents don’t just listen. They act. Implementing client feedback, even minor suggestions, can drastically refine your approach.</p>\n<p>How do you get the feedback? Consider a survey after a deal. Encourage your clients to share their opinions on anything that could improve future client experiences. Let them know you&#8217;re genuinely interested in their feedback.</p>\n<p>If you have a social media presence, use the feedback you already have at your fingertips &#8211; your analytics. You know, all that free information sitting in our accounts that we rarely look at? Review it now because those analytics offer insights into what works. Focus on which posts resonate the most and use this data to shape your content strategy.</p>\n<p>Now for the frosting on the cake! Make changes based on what you learn and tell your clients and potential clients about it! Sharing how you’ve evolved your services based on client input demonstrates responsiveness and underscores your dedication to client satisfaction. That’s some good optics!</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-missed-opportunities-to-retarget\">6. Missed Opportunities to Retarget</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_241979\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-241979\" style=\"width: 990px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241979\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Missed-Opportunities-to-Retarget.webp\" alt=\"Red dart hitting the bullseye on a dartboard, representing the importance of retargeting in real estate agent marketing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"261\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Missed-Opportunities-to-Retarget.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Missed-Opportunities-to-Retarget-300x78.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Missed-Opportunities-to-Retarget-768x200.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-241979\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Don’t miss out on retargeting opportunities.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another major real estate agent marketing mistake is missing opportunities to retarget. Don&#8217;t let potential clients <strong>slip through the cracks</strong>! You’ve already done the work coming up with great ads. Retargeting those ads is a fantastic way to reel back those who visited your site but left without engaging.</p>\n<p>One effective way to do this is through Facebook&#8217;s pixel-based ads, which track visitors and show them relevant ads later. For example, if a visitor browses a property listing, a retargeting ad can remind them of that listing, keeping your services top of mind.</p>\n<p>Creating list-based retargeting ads can also be effective. Uploading a list of potential leads to Facebook lets you target ads directly to those users, increasing the chance they’ll come back (Constant Contact). Regularly track and adjust your retargeting strategy to ensure it&#8217;s effective, and consider setting up A/B tests to see which ads perform best</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-ineffective-data-management\">5. Ineffective Data Management</h2>\n<p>A robust <strong>CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool</strong> isn&#8217;t just helpful; it&#8217;s critical. Using a CRM helps keep track of all your leads and your interactions with those leads, all in one place. This ensures you don’t miss any opportunities.</p>\n<p>As all working agents know, managing prospect and client information and interactions without a CRM becomes downright chaotic. That leads to missed follow-ups and lost sales.</p>\n<p>And, remember, regularly clean your data by removing outdated or incorrect information to keep your database accurate. Outdated data wastes your time and effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-sales-overdrive\">4. Sales Overdrive</h2>\n<p>Let’s get real. Sometimes, in the <strong>rush to get a client</strong>, you might come off a bit too strong. That eager beaver act? That’s a real estate agent marketing mistake that can scare off potential clients.</p>\n<p>Instead of going full throttle on the sales pitch, focus on building trust first. Do that by showcasing testimonials in all your marketing. Create a title for your happy client comments so that new potential clients can easily scan for what’s most important to them.</p>\n<p>For example, these are some titles to go with the testimonial that follows it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attentive and Supportive</strong>: My agent was attentive throughout the entire home-buying process. It seemed she wasn’t just about closing a deal, she was part of the journey with us.</li>\n<li><strong>Navigating Competitive Markets</strong>: Our agent found a hidden gem in a competitive market and negotiated the price down by 5%.</li>\n<li><strong>Stress-Free Selling</strong>: My agent’s compassion and expertise took the stress out of selling my family home.</li>\n<li><strong>First-Time Buyer Success</strong>: My agent patiently explained every step of the process and was always available to answer questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By showcasing client satisfaction and successful outcomes, you create a relatable and reassuring image that attracts more clients naturally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-slow-engagement-response\">3. Slow Engagement Response</h2>\n<p><strong>Yes, speed is everything</strong> in prospect and client communications! Monitor your messages and emails closely and respond as quickly as possible. Fast replies demonstrate your commitment to excellent customer service. Slow replies tell clients that you are too busy to meet their needs.</p>\n<p>What if you can’t always keep a close eye out? Consider setting up carefully crafted automated responses for common inquiries to ensure potential clients get answers promptly. This keeps them less likely to look for a prompt response elsewhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-setting-unrealistic-goals\">2. Setting Unrealistic Goals</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_241981\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-241981\" style=\"width: 990px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241981\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Setting-Unrealistic-Goals.webp\" alt=\"Person climbing a rocky hill, representing the challenge of setting realistic goals in real estate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"239\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Setting-Unrealistic-Goals.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Setting-Unrealistic-Goals-300x72.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Setting-Unrealistic-Goals-768x184.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-241981\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Avoid setting unrealistic goals in real estate marketing</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Many real estate agents aim high, but setting sky-high goals without grounding them in reality is like setting sail without a compass. It&#8217;s vital to set realistic targets that align with what&#8217;s typical in the real estate market. To help you set achievable goals, here are a few strategies and examples:</p>\n<h3 id=\"break-down-annual-goals-into-manageable-tasks\">Break Down annual Goals into Manageable Tasks</h3>\n<p>Set specific annual goals, like increasing your annual commission by selling one more home per month than last year. This can give you a clear target and a sense of direction.</p>\n<p>Break down these annual goals into monthly or weekly tasks. For instance, aim to hold two open houses per week or send out 20 handwritten cards to your sphere of influence and network each week</p>\n<h3 id=\"implement-smart-goals\">Implement SMART Goals</h3>\n<p>Use the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) framework to set clear and realistic goals. For example, host a homebuyers event each quarter or complete a certain number of CE credit hours by a specific date.</p>\n<p>This approach ensures your goals are ambitious, grounded in reality and trackable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"regularly-monitor-and-adjust-goals\">Regularly Monitor and Adjust Goals</h3>\n<p>Keep track of your progress with tools like Google Docs or a CRM system. Regularly reviewing your goals helps you stay on track and make necessary adjustments.</p>\n<p>Periodically analyze your performance to identify areas to improve or to adjust strategies if you’re not hitting your targets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"focus-on-building-habits\">Focus on Building Habits</h3>\n<p>Rather than solely focusing on outcomes, concentrate on and celebrate good habits. For example, make it a habit to call prospects daily or to post one YouTube video per week. Celebrate these small wins along the way to stay positive and motivated. This will help you keep pushing towards your larger goals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stay-accountable\">Stay Accountable</h3>\n<p>Stay accountable by sharing your goals with a mentor, broker, or friend. Better yet, partner up with a peer who also needs accountability and work to keep each other accountable.</p>\n<p>By setting realistic and manageable goals, you will build towards long-term success. You’ll stay on track and continue to grow your business effectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-not-learning-from-mistakes\">1. Not Learning from Mistakes</h2>\n<p>Yep, this is the number one real estate agent marketing mistake! Mistakes aren&#8217;t just mishaps. Mistakes are learning opportunities, like stepping stones to mastery. Every missed target or campaign hiccup is a lesson in disguise. Here&#8217;s how you can turn those slip-ups into success stories:</p>\n<h3 id=\"embrace-a-growth-mindset\">Embrace a Growth Mindset</h3>\n<p>Adopt a mindset where mistakes are viewed as opportunities for learning rather than failures. This mindset fosters resilience and continuous improvement. So, the next time you make a mistake say to yourself “in the lesson, find the gift.” That gift will make every day thereafter more effective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"document-lessons-learned\">Document Lessons Learned</h3>\n<p>Maintain a “lessons learned” log. Documenting what worked and what didn’t helps avoid repeating the same mistakes. For example, if a particular type of social media post gets little engagement, note that down and try a different approach next time</p>\n<p>Actively learning from mistakes makes all the difference. There is always something to be learned and improved if you take the time to figure it out and make the needed changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ve seen the pitfalls.

And let’s face it, happy agents tend to be more successful agents.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about something that most agents overlook—brokerage profitability. Trust me, you care more about this than you think. A profitable brokerage is more stable and less likely to make decisions that negatively impact agents and clients.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with <strong>Sotheby’s</strong> International Realty. As part of Anywhere Real Estate, which includes brands like Coldwell Banker, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, and Century 21, they’ve posted 20 quarters of earnings with 12 profitable and 8 unprofitable quarters. So, they’ve had <strong>60% profitable quarters</strong>—better than some, but still room for improvement.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, <strong>eXp Realty</strong>’s track record is hard to beat. With 20 quarters of posted earnings, they’ve had 15 profitable quarters, giving them <strong>75% profitable</strong> quarters.  And, by the way, when you look at all the publicly traded brokerages over the past 5 years<strong>, eXp Realty is the only profitable one</strong>.</p>\n<p>This kind of financial stability translates into continued improvements for both agents and clients. It’s simple—when a brokerage is making money, they reinvest in their agents, offering better tools, training, and opportunities for growth. So, if you want a brokerage that’s both growing and financially stable, eXp has the upper hand here.</p>\n<p>What does that mean for agents? It means you’re at a brokerage that’s constantly improving and innovating, making things better for you and your clients. If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s get into one of the hottest topics for agents—commission splits. How much of your hard-earned commission will you actually take home, and how much is going to the brokerage? This can be a bit trickier to pin down at Sotheby’s since splits vary depending on the agent and location, just like many traditional brokerages.</p>\n<p>When I interviewed <strong>at Sotheby’s,</strong> despite having a strong resume—including being a former California attorney and having a large sphere of influence—they offered me a 70/30 split. Yep, 70% to me, and 30% to Sotheby’s. Our research shows that their splits range from <strong>70/30 up to 90/10,</strong> depending on the office and what deal you manage to negotiate.</p>\n<p>Now, here’s where <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out: it’s transparent, and the split is the same for everyone—no negotiations, no guessing. eXp agents start at an <strong>80/20</strong> split and move to <strong>100%</strong> once the 20% you’ve paid to eXp reaches $16,000 for the year. That’s called a cap.</p>\n<p>And if you hit certain milestones after capping, eXp will actually give you back that <strong>$16,000 in company stock</strong>. So, not only do you get to keep 100% of your commissions after capping, but you can also earn <strong>more than 100%</strong> through stock opportunities. Pretty sweet, right?</p>\n<p>Plus, with eXp, it doesn’t matter if you’re a brand-new agent or a top producer—everyone gets the same deal. There’s no behind-the-scenes haggling. You know exactly what you’re getting from day one. At Sotheby’s, capping may be available in some markets, but it varies widely, so you’ll need to check locally.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is a must-have for agents, as it protects both you and your brokerage from potential legal claims. But how you pay for E&#038;O insurance can make a big difference, and here’s where Sotheby’s and eXp Realty really diverge.</p>\n<p>When I was looking at <strong>Sotheby’s</strong>, they quoted me a hefty <strong>$2,200</strong> due upfront every year before I even closed a deal. That’s a big chunk of cash to shell out, especially if you’re just starting out or haven’t closed any transactions yet.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty,</strong> it’s a whole different ball game. Agents don’t pay for E&#038;O insurance until they actually close deals, which means you’re only paying once you’ve earned money. And even then, it’s <strong>just $60 per deal</strong>. The best part? eXp <strong>caps the E&#038;O fees at $750</strong> per year. So, after you’ve paid that $750, you’re done for the year—no more E&#038;O fees, no matter how many deals you close. That’s a solid $1,450 savings over Sotheby’s, and you only pay it if you’re making money. Definitely a much better deal for your wallet!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Fees</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about fees—because no one wants to see their hard-earned commission eaten up by surprise charges.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, there’s an easy-to-manage <strong>$85 monthly </strong>fee, and there’s a <strong>$25 transaction</strong> fee per deal until you hit your cap. Super straightforward.</p>\n<p><strong>Sotheby’s</strong>? It’s a bit more complex. While they don’t have a direct transaction fee, they do charge a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> on every transaction. Honestly, this feels just like a transaction fee because it comes straight out of your commission every time you close a deal.</p>\n<p>Plus, at most offices, there’s also around <strong>$150 &#8211; $190 monthly </strong>fee, so that’s nearly double what eXp agents pay just to keep the lights on.</p>\n<p>When you stack up the numbers, eXp’s simpler fee structure ends up being a lot more cost-effective, especially when you start closing more deals. Sotheby’s royalty fee can really add up over time and take a bigger bite out of your earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned pro or just starting out, having the right training and support can make all the difference in your career. And this is where <strong>eXp Realty</strong> really stands out. They’ve got over <strong>50 live training sessions</strong> every week, plus a whole <strong>library of on-demand courses</strong>. New agents can jump into a <strong>“Fast Start” program</strong> to start earning fast, while more experienced agents can level up with advanced training like the <strong>“Kick Start” program</strong>.</p>\n<p>On top of that, sponsors (like us at Smart Agent Alliance) add even more training and mentorship to the mix. And, if you ever run into a snag, eXp offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> with <strong>2,000 full-time staff</strong> members ready to help out. It’s hard to beat that level of accessibility and resources.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about <strong>Sotheby’s</strong>. Unfortunately, the experience there varies—<em>a lot</em>. When I interviewed at Sotheby’s, I was basically told to go buy my own $2,200 course for training. There was <strong>no training</strong> in place, so what you get in terms of training depends heavily on your local office broker.</p>\n<p>And what about agent support? There’s <strong>hit or miss support</strong> based on your office broker’s availability. That can leave you hanging if you need quick help before a client meeting or during a deal.  Not ideal.</p>\n<p>At eXp, you’ll never be left waiting for your broker to be free. Their support system is built for agents, with experts on call whenever you need them. It’s the kind of setup that allows agents to thrive with confidence, knowing that help is always available.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to tech, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is a standout. They’ve taken the real estate world into the digital age with their fully virtual brokerage. Agents can access everything they need—training, support, collaboration, and even client meetings—in <strong>eXp World,</strong> their unique metaverse-style platform. No brick-and-mortar office is needed because eXp’s virtual setup is that effective. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Beyond that, eXp provides agents with a personal <strong>IDX website, a powerful CRM, a marketing center</strong> loaded with customizable templates, single property websites, social media content, <strong>and much more</strong>. And eXp is constantly improving, adding new tools and resources to keep agents ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p>Now, <strong>Sotheby’s</strong> isn’t exactly known for its cutting-edge tech. While it doesn’t have the fancy virtual platforms like eXp, it does offer <strong>global marketing</strong> for high-end home sellers through their established international presence.</p>\n<p>That’s great for agents working with luxury properties, but here’s the kicker—<strong>eXp Luxury</strong> offers the same level of <strong>global exposure</strong> for your listings at a fraction of the cost to the agent. That means eXp agents can market luxury properties worldwide while keeping more of their commissions in their pockets.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re tech-savvy or just appreciate having the best tools at your fingertips, eXp Realty is the clear winner. And even in the luxury space, eXp matches up with Sotheby’s global marketing power while being easier on your wallet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-sothebys-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Sotheby’s May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s be real—if you’re someone who thrives in a traditional office setting with that classic face-to-face interaction, then Sotheby’s might be the better fit.</p>\n<p>They’ve got physical offices where you can soak in that luxury vibe, and if you need the structure of an office broker pushing you to meet deadlines, Sotheby’s delivers. For agents who prefer having that in-person accountability, Sotheby’s could feel like home.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out of your home office space, eXp Realty does provide <strong>FREE access to the 4000 Regus office business lounges around the world</strong>.</p>\n<p>But that won’t be enough if you’re someone who likes being part of a more structured environment, where you need a local broker nearby for your daily motivation and productivity.  In that case, eXp Realty’s virtual freedom might not be for you.</p>\n<p>Not everyone thrives in a completely independent, online space. So, if you know you need someone to keep you on track, Sotheby’s is probably a better match for your style.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond all the usual perks, eXp Realty brings some truly standout features that most other brokerages just can’t match. If you work in the luxury market, eXp’s<strong> Luxury Division</strong> gives your high-end listings global exposure, putting them in front of the right audience worldwide.</p>\n<p>They’ve also got a team called <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose whole job is to find and deliver quality leads straight to eXp agents—pretty awesome, right?</p>\n<p>Their <strong>Referral tool</strong> makes sending referrals to other agents a breeze, and for those who want to focus solely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> helps cut costs while keeping you in the business.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, where you can earn extra income by simply recommending agents to join eXp. That income doesn’t just stop when you retire and it’s willable, meaning it keeps coming even after you’re gone. It’s a win all around!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Choosing between <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> and Sotheby’s comes down to what you value most as an agent. eXp offers transparency with an 80/20 commission split, low fees, 24/7 support, cutting-edge tech, and global marketing through eXp Luxury—all without the hefty royalty fees that Sotheby’s agents face.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sotheby’s provides physical office spaces and global marketing, but with fewer training and support resources, and more costly fees. If you thrive in a traditional office and value in-person accountability, Sotheby’s may suit you. But if you prefer flexibility, higher commission potential, and modern tools, eXp Realty has the edge.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Your brokerage also affects your everyday work life, the support you receive, and the tools available to help you grow your business.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing <strong>eXp Realty</strong> and <strong>Keller Williams</strong> and we’ll look at everything from commission splits and fees to training opportunities, agent satisfaction, and more. And, by the way, all of <strong>eXp Realty’s</strong> information is transparent and easy to access online, but with <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, it’s not so easy and some details are hard to pin down. But we’ve done the research!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s kick things off by seeing how happy agents are at each brokerage. Based on Glassdoor reviews, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds a stellar <strong>4.6-star</strong> rating, while <strong>Keller Williams</strong> is also highly rated at <strong>4.3 stars</strong>. These ratings reflect how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience at each company.</p>\n<p>And as we all know, happy agents tend to be more successful agents.

Simple—if a brokerage is financially stable, it’s more likely to keep investing in its agents by offering better tools, more training, and reliable support. A financially shaky brokerage might start making decisions that hurt agents, such as slashing commissions or adding new fees.</p>\n<p>Unlike eXp Realty, <strong>Keller Williams doesn’t have publicly traded stock, so their profitability is harder to gauge</strong>. Without that transparency, you’re left in the dark when it comes to understanding how well they’re really doing financially.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is completely transparent about its financials. eXp has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 of those quarters being profitable</strong>—a solid <strong>75% profitability rate</strong>.</p>\n<p>Even better, <strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been consistently profitable for the past five years.</strong> That kind of stability is crucial because it means continuous improvements for agents and clients without unexpected changes that hurt your bottom line.</p>\n<p>If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s dive into one of the most critical factors for any agent—<strong>commission splits</strong>.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, commission splits can vary quite a bit depending on the office, but they typically range from <strong>70/30, </strong>and once you’ve paid between <strong>$21,000 &#8211; $30,000</strong> depending on the location, you get to earn <strong>100% commission</strong> for the remainder of the year.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, every agent starts at an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong>. Plus, eXp offers stock awards for hitting certain milestones, and you can even earn your <strong>$16,000 cap back in company stock</strong> if you meet additional goals.</p>\n<p>The best part? eXp’s commission structure is the same for every agent in every location—no need to negotiate or wonder if someone else is getting a better deal. And with the potential to earn <strong>more than 100% of your commission</strong> through eXp’s stock opportunities, it’s a win-win.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>When it comes to Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance, how each brokerage handles this can make a big difference in your yearly expenses.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, E&#038;O insurance costs agents between <strong>$122 &#8211; $350 per month</strong> depending on the office, but it’s unclear whether this is paid upfront or on a per-deal basis.</p>\n<p>Over at <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, Agents only pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and there’s a yearly cap of <strong>$750</strong>. So once you’ve hit that cap, you don’t have to worry about paying for E&#038;O insurance for the rest of the year, no matter how many deals you close.</p>\n<p>This structure is especially beneficial for new agents who might not want to deal with hefty upfront costs before they’ve even started making money.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Fees</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about <strong>fees</strong> because hidden costs can really add up. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay a predictable <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and <strong>$25 per transaction</strong> until they hit their cap. No surprises, no excessive charges—just straightforward, manageable costs.</p>\n<p>Fees at <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, however, are more complicated. Monthly fees range from <strong>$122 to $350</strong>, depending on the office, and agents also pay a <strong>6% royalty fee per transaction</strong> until they cap. This means that in addition to the monthly fees, you’re also paying a percentage of every deal, which can eat into your earnings pretty quickly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Even experienced agents know that <strong>training</strong> and <strong>support</strong> can make all the difference in growing your business. So how do these two brokerages compare?</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training is outstanding. With <strong>over 50 live training sessions every week</strong>, a <span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">full<strong> on-demand</strong></span><strong> course library</strong>, and programs like <strong>Fast Start</strong> for new agents and <strong>Kick Start</strong> for experienced agents, you’re never short of opportunities to learn.</p>\n<p>Plus, <strong>eXp</strong> offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> through its virtual platform, eXp World, and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> are ready to assist when you need help.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, <strong>training and support vary by office</strong>. They do offer educational courses, but these come with a price tag, costing agents anywhere from <strong>$299 &#8211; $2,500 per course</strong>. <strong>Support</strong> is also <strong>dependent on the office</strong> you’re in, so while you may receive excellent help at some locations, other offices might leave you hanging.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to tech, eXp Realty is at the forefront with its fully virtual brokerage model. Agents can do everything online through eXp tech including <strong>eXp World</strong>, where agents meet with brokers, attend training sessions, and collaborate with other agents. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>eXp also offers each agent an <strong>IDX website</strong>, a <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> packed with customizable templates, social media content, and more. The tech at eXp Realty is constantly being updated, ensuring agents always have the best tools at their fingertips.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we couldn’t uncover much detailed information about the technology and resources provided at <strong>Keller Williams</strong>. While they likely offer tools for agents, there’s <strong>no clear standard</strong> across all offices, so your experience might vary based on where you work.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-keller-williams-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Keller Williams May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>If you’re an agent who prefers the <strong>traditional brokerage model</strong>, with the structure of physical offices and face-to-face interactions, then <strong>Keller Williams</strong> might be a better fit. They have a long-standing reputation and strong branding, and for some agents, having a local broker to guide and keep them in line is a key part of their success.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out-of-home office space, <strong>eXp Realty provides FREE access to the 4,000 Regus office business lounges around the world.</strong> But that won’t be enough if you thrive in a more structured environment, where your office broker helps push your productivity every day. If that’s the case, Keller Williams might feel more like home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t have. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry. And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp.</p>\n<p>The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>In the end, the choice between <strong>eXp Realty</strong> and <strong>Keller Williams</strong> comes down to your work style and what you value in a brokerage. <strong>Keller Williams</strong> offers a more traditional office environment with higher caps and additional fees, which might suit agents who like a more hands-on approach. On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> provides <strong>transparent splits, lower fees</strong>, cutting-edge tech, and <strong>24/7 support</strong>—making it the better choice for agents who value flexibility, innovation, and keeping more of their earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Sure, that’s critical, but your brokerage also shapes your daily life, how much support you get, and how many resources you can access to grow your career.</p>\n<p>Today, we’ll compare eXp Realty and RE/MAX—two well-known names in the real estate world. We’ll dig into their commission splits, fees, training opportunities, and, just as important, agent satisfaction.</p>\n<p>And, note that the information on eXp Realty is readily available, but with RE/MAX, not so much.  You either need to dig a little deeper to get the full picture. But don’t worry, we’ve done the work for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs REMAX: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s start with how happy agents are at each brokerage. According to Glassdoor, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds an impressive <strong>4.6 star rating</strong>, while RE/MAX isn’t far behind with it <strong>4.2 star rating</strong>. These ratings tell you a lot about how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience at each company.</p>\n<p>And, as we all know, happy agents are usually more successful agents.

Because a financially stable brokerage means better resources, better tools, and fewer surprise changes that might hurt your wallet. Let’s take a look at how these two brokerages compare when it comes to financial stability.</p>\n<p><strong>RE/MAX</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>14 profitable quarters</strong>—so they’re sitting at <strong>70% profitability</strong>. However, when you dig into the numbers, RE/MAX tends to have <strong>huge losing quarters and smaller profitable ones</strong>, so while they’ve been profitable, the overall picture isn’t as rosy as it looks.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, eXp Realty has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>, which puts them at <strong>75% profitability</strong>. More importantly<strong>, </strong>eXp doesn’t have those huge losses like RE/MAX and, in fact,<strong> eXp is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years.</strong></p>\n<p>That financial stability translates to continuous improvements for both agents and clients, without cutting corners or slashing pay.

Let’s see how much of your hard-earned money you get to keep at each brokerage.</p>\n<p>At <strong>RE/MAX</strong>, splits range from <strong>60/40 to 95/5</strong>, and they offer two agent plans to choose from each with different fees attached.  Again, the specifics vary between agents and offices.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the splits are much simpler. Every agent starts at an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once the 20% you’ve paid to eXp hits <strong>$16,000 for the year</strong>, you move to <strong>100% commission </strong>for the remainder of the year. Plus, eXp rewards agents with <strong>stock</strong> for hitting certain milestones, and you can even get your <strong>$16,000 cap back in stock</strong> if you meet additional goals.</p>\n<p>So all eXp agents have the opportunity to earn <strong>more than 100% commission</strong> each year. And remember, eXp’s commission structure is the same for <strong>every agent, in every location</strong>—no haggling, no special deals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs REMAX: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>When it comes to Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance, eXp Realty and RE/MAX approach things differently.</p>\n<p>At <strong>RE/MAX,</strong> I found that agents are charged <strong>$400 a year</strong> for E&#038;O insurance, admittedly that is curiously low so we’re not sure it’s correct.  We also don’t know when this is due. It’s probably upfront though, considering how low the cost is.</p>\n<p>Over at eXp Realty, agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but only when they close a deal. Plus, eXp caps your total E&#038;O insurance at <strong>$750 per year</strong>, which means no more payments after you hit that cap.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs REMAX: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really add up, and they vary greatly between these two brokerages. At eXp Realty, agents pay a <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and <strong>$25 per transaction</strong> until they cap. Super predictable.</p>\n<p>But at <strong>RE/MAX</strong>, the fees are all over the place. Agents can pay anywhere from <strong>$300 &#8211; $2500 a month</strong> depending on the office they’re working out of. And under one of their plans, there’s even a <strong>$499 per transaction fee</strong>. Ouch!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs REMAX: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about training and support—because even seasoned agents need guidance and resources to stay at the top of their game.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the support is phenomenal. You get access to over <strong>50 live training sessions per week</strong>, an entire <strong>on-demand library of courses</strong>, a <strong>“Fast Start” program</strong> designed to get new agents earning, and a <strong>“Kick Start” program</strong> for experienced agents. And, if you ever need help, eXp offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> and they have over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> ready to assist you.</p>\n<p>With <strong>RE/MAX</strong>, it’s a bit more hit-or-miss. They offer training through their <strong>online academy</strong>, but the level of <strong>support varies by office</strong>. Most support depends on how available the local office broker is. So, if you need help late at night or early in the morning, you might be on your own until the office opens.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs REMAX: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Both RE/MAX and eXp Realty are pretty tech-savvy, but eXp takes things to the next level.</p>\n<p>eXp Realty is a virtual brokerage—no physical offices are required because everything is done online. You get access to <strong>eXp World</strong>, a metaverse-style platform where you can meet with your broker, get tech support, and attend training. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp offers agents their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a robust<strong> CRM (kvCORE),</strong> a <strong>marketing center</strong>, and a <strong>steady stream of new tools</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>RE/MAX</strong> offers some similar tech, including the <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong> and a <strong>pre-made marketing</strong> package that includes flyers, postcards, and social media posts for your listings. But that’s about where the similarities end. While RE/MAX’s tools are solid, eXp Realty’s tech suite is constantly expanding, and their fully virtual platform sets them apart.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-remax-may-be-best-for-you\">Why REMAX May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>If you’re someone who prefers the traditional brokerage model with physical office spaces and enjoys the camaraderie of working in a local office, RE/MAX might be the better fit for you.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out of your home office space, eXp Realty does provide <strong>FREE access to the 4000 Regus office business lounges around the world</strong>. But that won’t be enough if you’re someone who likes being in a more structured environment, where your office broker checks on your daily productivity.  In that case, eXp Realty’s virtual freedom might not be for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t have. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry. And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp.</p>\n<p>The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>So, when it comes down to <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> vs REMAX, it’s a close race, but eXp Realty comes out ahead with its <strong>transparent commission splits</strong>, <strong>lower fees</strong>, and <strong>better support and technology</strong>. RE/MAX has a solid reputation and office presence, which might be ideal for agents who prefer the traditional model, but overall, <strong>eXp Realty offers more value for most agents</strong>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.
