Investing in a prep course can increase your chances of passing the exam on the first attempt.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exam Day Tips</h3>\n<p>Ensure you arrive at the exam center early to avoid any last-minute stress.

Adhering to the rules ensures a smooth and fair testing experience for everyone. If you have any questions or issues, ask the proctors for assistance.</p>\n<p>After passing the exam, you must complete a fingerprinting requirement for a background check. This is a mandatory step to ensure you meet the honesty and integrity standards set by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR).</p>\n<p>Use a Live Scan service provider approved by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). Live Scan is an electronic fingerprinting process that is fast and secure. Locate a service provider near you and schedule an appointment (You can get this done for around $50-$80)</p>\n<p>Fill out and submit the appropriate form along with the fingerprinting fee. The Live Scan service provider will electronically transmit your fingerprints to the FDLE. Keep a copy of the form and receipt for your records.</p>\n<p>Be prepared to pay the fingerprinting fee, which varies by provider. The fee typically includes the cost of the Live Scan service and the background check. Confirm the total cost when scheduling your appointment.</p>\n<p>The DBPR will conduct a background check using your fingerprints. This check ensures you meet the honesty and integrity standards required for a real estate license. Any issues identified during the background check may need to be addressed before your license is granted.</p>\n<p>If any issues arise during the background check, be prepared to provide additional documentation or explanations. Demonstrating honesty and taking responsibility for past actions can positively impact the DBPR’s decision. Seek legal advice if necessary to navigate any complex issues.</p>\n<p>The next step is to submit the Salesperson License Application.

Ensure all sections are completed accurately. You can access the <a href=\"https://www.myfloridalicense.com/CheckListDetail.asp?SID=&#038;xactCode=1010&#038;clientCode=2501&#038;XACT_DEFN_ID=744\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">form here</a>.</p>\n<p>Include proof that you passed the exam.

    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Compass vs Sotheby&#8217;s to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-compass-vs-sothebys\">Final Thoughts on Compass vs Sotheby&#8217;s</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<div style=\"height: 12px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Compass offers splits ranging from 60/40 to 92.5/7.5, with a no franchise/royalty fee, and some agents get a cap. Sotheby&#8217;s provides splits starting at 70/30 and going up to 90/10, also with a 6% franchise/royalty fee, and no cap.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees also differ significantly. Compass charges $145, varying by office, whereas Sotheby&#8217;s monthly fees also vary by office. Additionally, Compass charges transaction fees up to 4%, while Sotheby&#8217;s includes transaction fees within their royalty fees. These differences can impact an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning, making it important to consider each brokerage&#8217;s fee structure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Unfortunately, neither Compass nor Sotheby&#8217;s offers revenue share programs, retirement income paths, or willable income paths, limiting agents primarily to their commission-based earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Compass offers training through Compass Academy, providing structured learning opportunities. In contrast, Sotheby&#8217;s provides training that varies by office, which might lead to inconsistencies in the quality of training received. Neither brokerage offers 24/7 support, which can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Compass is recognized for its technological advancements and robust tools available through Compass Academy. Sotheby&#8217;s also incorporates technological tools, but its offerings vary by office. Both brokerages provide valuable technological resources, but the specific tools and platforms offered may appeal differently depending on the agent’s needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Compass has a Glassdoor rating of 3.7 stars based on 2.4K reviews, indicating areas needing improvement. Sotheby&#8217;s holds a slightly higher rating of 4.0 stars from 501 reviews, suggesting relatively higher agent satisfaction. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-compass-vs-sothebys\">Final Thoughts on Compass vs Sotheby&#8217;s</h2>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Compass</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sotheby&#8217;s</a>, it’s evident that each brokerage has its strengths and weaknesses. Sotheby&#8217;s offers a more traditional structure with consistent fee inclusions, making it a stable choice for many agents.

Choosing the right brokerage sets the foundation for your success. Pick the right one, and you’re off to a great start. Pick the wrong one, and it’s tough to get moving. Here’s your handy-dandy index:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-your-brokerage-choice-matters\">Why Your Brokerage Choice Matters</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-overview\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Overview</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-agent-satisfaction\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-brokerage-availability\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Brokerage Availability</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-brokerage-profitability\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Brokerage Profitability</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-commission-splits\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Commission Splits</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-e-o-insurance\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: E&#038;O Insurance</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-fees\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-training-and-support\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-technology-and-resources\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#e-xps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<p><a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-your-brokerage-choice-matters\">Why Your Brokerage Choice Matters</h2>\n<p>Your choice of brokerage impacts far more than just your paycheck. It defines your entire real estate career. Sure, commission splits are a major factor, but the resources, training, support, and even the day-to-day experience you’ll have as an agent are just as important.</p>\n<p>Picking the right brokerage means finding the one that best fits your style, goals, and needs—while also helping you maximize your income.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-overview\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Overview</h2>\n<p>Fathom Realty and eXp Realty are cloud-based brokerages without physical office space. However, for those agents who desire to work outside their homes or to have a place to meet with clients, eXp Realty does offer FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide.</p>\n<p>Both Fathom Realty and eXp Realty are looking to provide agents with better splits as neither pays out agent earnings to layers of franchise owners. To understand more about that, check out the eXp Explained video found here.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-agent-satisfaction\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>A key way to gauge how happy you’ll be at a brokerage is by checking out agent satisfaction. According to Glassdoor, eXp Realty holds a 4.6-star rating from over 3,500 reviews, while Fathom Realty also boasts a 4.6-star rating, but from just 425 reviews.</p>\n<p>However, eXp Realty consistently ranks on Glassdoor&#8217;s Top 100 Companies list from 2018 to 2024, while Fathom Realty hasn’t made an appearance on that list. That consistent recognition speaks volumes about the agent experience and satisfaction at eXp Realty.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog &#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221; Spoiler alert: eXp Realty ranks #1 on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-brokerage-availability\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Brokerage Availability</h2>\n<p>Another critical consideration is where these brokerages operate. eXp Realty spans 50 states and 24 countries with a robust agent network of over 80,000 agents. This broad reach provides agents with unmatched opportunities to collaborate and grow globally.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Fathom Realty operates in 41 states and 5 countries, with an agent count exceeding 11,000. While Fathom has a solid presence, eXp Realty&#8217;s broader global reach and larger network offer agents a far wider range of opportunities, resources, and potential for referrals—an important factor when choosing between eXp Realty and Fathom Realty.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-brokerage-profitability\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why does profitability matter? Because a financially stable brokerage can keep offering you great tools, training, and support without cutting corners. When a brokerage is in the red, agents often feel the pinch.</p>\n<p>Fathom Realty has posted 19 quarters of earnings, but with only 1 profitable quarter. That’s a tough track record to overlook as it’s unclear if Fathom will survive especially now that the real estate business is changing due to the new NAR rules. On the other hand, eXp Realty has posted 20 quarters of earnings, with 15 profitable quarters, putting them at 75% profitability.</p>\n<p>More importantly, eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the past five years. That kind of stability means continued improvements for agents and clients, with no surprises or cost-cutting measures that might hurt your bottom line.</p>\n<p>If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog &#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-commission-splits\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>When it comes to commission splits, this is where agents usually focus most of their attention—it determines how much of your hard-earned commission stays in your pocket.</p>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a 100% commission brokerage, meaning you keep all of your commission, but you pay various transaction fees depending on the size of the sale. Fathom also offers a recruiting income model similar to revenue share, but it requires you to join one of their paid plans, and commissions are only earned from producing agents. The Cap4Life program is another path to reduce fees long term, but it has a steep qualification threshold.</p>\n<p>At eXp Realty, agents start with an 80/20 split, and once you’ve paid $16,000 to the brokerage for the year, you cap and move to 100% commission. Plus, eXp rewards agents with stock for hitting certain milestones, and you can even get your $16,000 cap back in company stock.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: eXp agents can earn more than 100% of their commission while getting all the other benefits that only eXp Realty offers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-e-o-insurance\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is critical for protecting you and your brokerage from potential legal claims. At Fathom Realty, agents pay $0 in upfront E&#038;O insurance, but there is a $35 per transaction fee and no cap.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, at eXp Realty, agents pay $60 per transaction. Plus, once you hit $750 for the year, you’re capped and done paying for E&#038;O.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-fees\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Fees</h2>\n<p>Next up, let’s talk fees, because no one wants to be surprised by extra costs eating into their earnings.</p>\n<p>Fathom Realty charges $99 to join and has a $550 fee for your first 15 sales under $600K. For deals over $600K, there are additional fees: $200 for sales up to $1 million, and another $250 for every additional $500K. At eXp Realty, agents pay an $85 monthly fee and a $25 transaction fee per deal until they hit their cap.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-training-and-support\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re new or a seasoned pro, training and support are key to growing your business.</p>\n<p>eXp Realty offers over 50 live training sessions every week, along with an extensive on-demand library full of resources. New agents can jump into the Fast Start program to get up and running quickly, while more experienced agents can take advantage of the Kick Start program to keep leveling up.</p>\n<p>And with 24/7 support and over 2,000 full-time staff members, you’ll never be left without help when you need it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Fathom Realty offers limited live training hours. It’s also unknown how much support is available at Fathom, so be sure to check when you interview there.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-vs-fathom-technology-and-resources\">eXp Realty vs. Fathom: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Staying ahead of the game requires the right tools, and eXp Realty excels in this area. As a fully virtual brokerage, eXp agents can do everything online, from meeting with their broker to attending training sessions.</p>\n<p>The eXp World platform is a metaverse for agents, allowing them to collaborate and work together in real time. Only eXp World has this amazing feature for agents! Want to know more? Check out our blog on eXp World!</p>\n<p>eXp Realty also provides each agent with their own IDX website, a powerful kvCORE CRM, and a marketing center filled with customizable templates for social media, flyers, and more.</p>\n<p>Fathom Realty’s technology and resources are less well-known. There isn’t much information available about what tech tools they provide to agents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t provide. eXp Realty has a luxury division with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, Revenos, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s Referral tool that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s Referral Division slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there’s Revenue Share, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. Revenue Share opportunities at eXp can’t be beat. The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Learn more about the amazing opportunity for revenue share income from our blog here.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that because eXp Realty is uniquely profitable, eXp continues to innovate and provide more exclusive resources helping agents and their clients. eXp Realty works hard to maintain its tag line as the most agent-centric brokerage on the planet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>When comparing eXp Realty to Fathom Realty, it’s clear that eXp Realty stands out with its transparent commission splits, lower fees, and unparalleled support and technology. Fathom Realty is a solid choice for agents who prefer the 100% commission model, but when it comes to overall value and income opportunities, eXp Realty has the upper hand.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the only <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/profits/\">profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years If you’re ready to align yourself with the brokerage that prioritizes results over gimmicks, and you want the added support of a powerhouse team like Smart Agent Alliance, then it’s time to level up.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/smart-agent-alliance\">Smart Agent Alliance</a> runs meetings so you gain <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share/\">passive income</a> and gives agents access to:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A branded to you, hosted real estate agent attraction website</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/marketing-course\">Social Agent Academy Pro ($10,500 value</a>) for social media marketing</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Weekly coaching sessions where you’ll be part of our agent family</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Customizable lead funnels, email campaigns, and marketing templates</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>And more…</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b182ea753238642b-Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp/public\" alt=\"Team SAA - Smart Agent Alliance\" class=\"wp-image-267426 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Team-SAA-Smart-Agent-Alliance-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>All free for agents who join eXp Realty and name Smart Agent Alliance as their sponsor.

Sure, the paycheck matters, but the resources, training, support, and the day-to-day experience you’ll have as an agent are crucial too. Picking the right brokerage means finding one that suits your style, your goals, and gives you the tools to maximize your income and build a successful career.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-lpt-realty-overview\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248131\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/fe61936f9a140e79-Brokerage-Availability.png/public\" alt=\"a green tick in a check box\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Brokerage-Availability.png 256w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Brokerage-Availability-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs. LPT Realty: Overview</h2>\n<p>Both LPT Realty and eXp Realty are cloud-based brokerages with no brick-and-mortar office spaces, making them both flexible options for agents.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re an agent who prefers having a place to work outside your home or wants a professional setting to meet with clients, eXp Realty offers <strong>FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide</strong>. This access gives eXp agents an additional edge when it comes to meeting clients or collaborating with other professionals in a formal environment.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages are designed to provide agents with better commission splits by avoiding franchise owners’ layers, allowing more money to go into the agents’ pockets.

On <strong>Glassdoor</strong>, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds an impressive <strong>4.6-star rating from over 3,500 reviews</strong>, while <strong>LPT Realty</strong> comes in slightly lower with a <strong>4.3-star rating from just 37 reviews</strong>.</p>\n<p>Notably, eXp Realty has consistently made it onto <strong>Glassdoor’s Top 100 Companies list from 2018 to 2024</strong>, a level of recognition LPT Realty has yet to achieve. The consistency of eXp’s recognition highlights a strong track record of agent satisfaction and support.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-lpt-realty-brokerage-availability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248131\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/fe61936f9a140e79-Brokerage-Availability.png/public\" alt=\"a green tick in a check box\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Brokerage-Availability.png 256w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Brokerage-Availability-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs. LPT Realty: Brokerage Availability</h2>\n<p>Another big factor when choosing a brokerage is where they operate. <strong>eXp Realty</strong> spans <strong>50 states and 24 countries</strong>, with a powerful agent network of over <strong>80,000 agents</strong>. This broad reach offers unmatched opportunities for agents to collaborate globally, expand their client base, and build referral relationships around the world.</p>\n<p>By contrast, <strong>LPT Realty</strong> currently operates in <strong>31 states</strong>, with an agent count exceeding <strong>4,500</strong>. While LPT Realty is growing, it doesn’t yet match the global presence and network size of eXp Realty. If you’re looking for a broader reach and more expansive resources, <strong>eXp Realty’s</strong> global network offers more opportunities for collaboration and income generation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-lpt-realty-brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a37cf1e2cc5b6038-Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs. LPT Realty: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why does profitability matter to you as an agent? A financially stable brokerage can continue investing in tools, training, and support for its agents. When brokerages struggle financially, they may cut back on resources or start implementing fees that hurt your bottom line.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> does not currently have listed stock, so it’s difficult to know how profitable or unprofitable the company is. For new agents, this might raise questions about long-term financial stability.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong> with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>, which means <strong>75% profitability</strong>. Additionally, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is the only publicly traded brokerage that has been profitable for the last five years, which signals continued stability and growth.</p>\n<p>If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-lpt-realty-commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cf7f04b909c13ff1-Commission-Splits-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs. LPT Realty: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>Let’s get into what most agents care about most—commission splits. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> offers a <strong>100% commission</strong> model for agents unless they choose to participate in the company’s <strong>Revenue Share Partner</strong> program. In that case, agents work on an <strong>80/20 split</strong> until they hit their <strong>$15,000 cap</strong>, after which they keep <strong>100%</strong> of their commissions.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage for the year, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong>.</p>\n<p>But here’s the kicker—eXp Realty rewards agents with <strong>company stock</strong> for hitting certain production milestones, and if you meet additional goals, you can earn your <strong>$16,000 cap back in stock</strong>. This means eXp agents can earn more than 100% of their commission, all while enjoying top-tier benefits that eXp offers its agents across the board.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-lpt-realty-fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs. LPT Realty: Fees</h2>\n<p>When it comes to fees, let’s look at what both brokerages charge.</p>\n<p>At <strong>LPT Realty</strong>, agents pay a <strong>$500 annual fee</strong> on their first sale. Agents then have two monthly fee options: <strong>$89 per month</strong> for standard agents or <strong>$149 per month</strong> for Revenue Share Partners. On top of that, there’s a <strong>$195 transaction fee</strong> per deal.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until they cap. The straightforward nature of eXp’s fees makes it easier for agents to plan their expenses and know exactly where their money is going.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay <strong>$60 for E&#038;O insurance per transaction</strong>. Once you hit <strong>$750 for the year</strong>, you’re capped and done paying for E&#038;O, giving you peace of mind and saving you money in the long run. At <strong>LPT Realty</strong>, there is <strong>no upfront E&#038;O insurance cost.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-lpt-realty-training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs. LPT Realty: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Training and support are critical factors in an agent’s success, no matter how experienced you are.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents get access to <strong>over 50 live training sessions each week</strong>, plus an extensive <strong>on-demand library</strong> with courses and resources for every stage of your career. New agents can dive into the <strong>Fast Start program</strong>, designed to get them up and running quickly, while more seasoned agents can benefit from the <strong>Kick Start program</strong> to level up their business.</p>\n<p>On top of that, eXp offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> through <strong>over 2,000 full-time staff members</strong>, so you’re never left without help.</p>\n<p>At <strong>LPT Realty</strong>, live training is more limited, and the amount of support agents get seems to vary depending on the office. If continuous professional development and on-demand support are must-haves for you, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> may be the stronger choice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-lpt-realty-technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs. LPT Realty: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Technology is a key driver of success in today’s real estate world, and <strong>eXp Realty</strong> leads the way with its virtual-first approach. The entire company is based online, so agents can access everything—from training to support—via the <strong>eXp World</strong> platform.</p>\n<p>It’s a metaverse-style environment where you can meet with brokers, collaborate with peers, and attend training sessions in real-time. Want more details? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>In addition, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> provides agents with their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a robust <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a marketing center full of customizable templates for social media, flyers, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty’s</strong> technology and resources aren’t as well-publicized, with no clear information on the tech tools they offer to their agents. Without details on what technology support is provided, it’s hard to compare the two, but <strong>eXp Realty</strong>’s extensive suite of tools is hard to beat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-lpt-realty-income-opportunities\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248130\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5e39c75302654f98-Income-Opportunities.png/public\" alt=\"a cartoon hand holding a green bag\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Income-Opportunities.png 256w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Income-Opportunities-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs. LPT Realty: Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>When it comes to income opportunities, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out with multiple revenue streams, including <strong>revenue share</strong>, <strong>stock production awards</strong>, and the ability to purchase <strong>discounted stock</strong>—all designed to help agents build long-term financial security. While <strong>LPT Realty</strong> also offers revenue share, it doesn’t provide stock options since it isn’t publicly listed.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages offer revenue share programs, but there’s a key difference: At <strong>LPT Realty</strong>, agents must first meet their <strong>$15,000 cap</strong> before earning any revenue share that year, whereas <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has no such requirement—allowing agents to start earning from day one.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <strong>eXp Realty&#8217;s revenue share pool</strong> is significantly larger, sitting at approximately <strong>$204 million</strong>, compared to <strong>$16 million</strong> at <strong>LPT Realty</strong>.</p>\n<p>Another advantage for <strong>eXp Realty</strong> agents is the ability to offer <strong>unique value</strong> to attract other agents to their sponsor line, setting themselves apart with exclusive resources. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> agents don’t have this level of differentiation, as all sponsors offer the same resources.</p>\n<p>This entrepreneurial flexibility gives <strong>eXp Realty</strong> agents a significant edge in recruiting and growing their revenue share.

    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Compass vs Corcoran to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-compass-vs-corcoran\">Final Thoughts on Compass vs Corcoran</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Compass offers splits ranging from 60/40 to 92.5/7.5, with a no franchise/royalty fee. Corcoran provides splits starting at 50/50 and going up to 70/30, with a 6% franchise/royalty fee as well. Furthermore, Coompass does technically have a production cap, though not always, this gets a bit murky, Corcoran on the other hand doesnt at all.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees also differ significantly. Compass charges $145, varying by office, whereas Corcoran’s fees also vary by office but include the franchise fee within their royalty fees. Additionally, Compass charges transaction fees up to 4%, while Corcoran includes transaction fees within their royalty fees. These differences can impact an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning, making it important to consider each brokerage&#8217;s fee structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Unfortunately, neither Compass nor Corcoran offers revenue share programs, retirement income paths, or willable income paths, limiting agents primarily to their commission-based earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Compass offers training through Compass Academy, providing structured learning opportunities. In contrast, Corcoran provides training that varies by office, which might lead to inconsistencies in the quality of training received. Neither brokerage offers 24/7 support, which can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Compass is recognized for its technological advancements and robust tools available through Compass Academy. On the other hand, Corcoran, while incorporating some technological tools, still focuses heavily on traditional methods. Both brokerages provide valuable technological resources, but the specific tools and platforms offered may appeal differently depending on the agent’s needs.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Corcoran boasts a high Glassdoor rating of 4.4 stars based on 321 reviews, indicating strong agent approval and satisfaction. Compass holds a lower rating of 3.7 stars from 2.4K reviews, suggesting that there may be areas needing improvement. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts on Compass vs Corcoran</h2>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Compass</a> and <a href=\"https://www.corcoran.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Corcoran</a>, it’s evident that each brokerage has its strengths and weaknesses. Corcoran offers a more consistent fee structure and higher agent satisfaction, making it a stable choice for many agents. Compass, with its advanced technology and structured training through Compass Academy, appeals to those who prioritize technological integration and continuous learning.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison and to find the best brokerage for your needs, check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.</p>\n<p>When making your decision, consider your specific needs and career objectives.

Keller Williams offers flexible splits ranging from 70/30 to 100/0, with a 6% franchise/royalty fee until the cap is reached. Compass provides splits starting at 60/40 and going up to 92.5/7.5, with no franchise/royalty fee, and only some agents get a production cap.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees for Keller Williams vary by office, whereas Compass charges $145 and varies by office. Additionally, Keller Williams does not charge transaction fees, while Compass charges up to 4% per transaction. Keller Williams has a more straightforward fee structure, potentially making it more predictable for agents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Keller Williams stands out by offering revenue share programs that provide a retirement and willable income path. These additional income streams can offer substantial long-term financial benefits and security. Conversely, Compass does not offer such supplementary income opportunities, limiting agents primarily to their commission-based earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Keller Williams excels in this area, providing extensive training opportunities, though specific details on the extent of their offerings are not standardized across all offices. Agents at Keller Williams also benefit from various support structures, although 24/7 support is not available. In contrast, Compass offers training through Compass Academy, but similar to Keller Williams, 24/7 support is not provided. This difference can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Keller Williams is known for its robust technology platforms, offering tools that enhance productivity and client engagement. On the other hand, Compass is also recognized for its technological advancements, including its Compass Academy for training. Both brokerages provide valuable technological resources, but the specific tools and platforms offered may appeal differently depending on the agent’s needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Keller Williams boasts a high Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars based on 7.9K reviews, indicating strong agent approval and satisfaction. Compass holds a lower rating of 3.7 stars from 2.4K reviews, suggesting that there may be areas needing improvement. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-compass-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Compass vs Keller Williams</h2>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Compass</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kw.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keller Williams</a>, it’s evident that Keller Williams offers more favorable commission splits, extensive training, and additional income opportunities, making it a compelling choice for both new and experienced agents. The innovative technology and comprehensive support further enhance Keller Williams&#8217; appeal. Compass, while also offering advanced technology and structured training through Compass Academy, has higher fees and fewer income paths, which may limit its appeal to agents seeking comprehensive support and modern business solutions.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison and to find the best brokerage for your needs, check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.</p>\n<p>When making your decision, consider your specific needs and career objectives.

Sure, the paycheck matters, but the resources, training, support, and the day-to-day experience you’ll have as an agent are equally crucial. Picking the right brokerage means finding one that aligns with your goals and gives you the tools to maximize your income and build a thriving career.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-real-broker-overview\">eXp Realty vs. Real Broker: Overview</h2>\n<p>Both <strong>Real Broker</strong> and <strong>eXp Realty</strong> operate as cloud-based brokerages without traditional brick-and-mortar office spaces, which makes them flexible and efficient options for agents.</p>\n<p>However, if you prefer having a place to work outside your home or a professional setting to meet clients, <strong>eXp Realty offers FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges </strong>worldwide. This gives <strong>eXp agents</strong> an extra edge for client meetings and collaborations in a formal setting.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages are structured to provide agents with better commission splits by avoiding franchise owners’ layers, which means more money in the agents’ pockets.

On <strong>Glassdoor</strong>, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds a 4.6-star rating from over 3,500 reviews, while <strong>Real Broker</strong> has a strong 4.5-star rating from 109 reviews.</p>\n<p>Notably, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has consistently made it onto <strong>Glassdoor’s Top 100 Companies</strong> list every year from 2018 to 2024, which speaks to the consistent agent satisfaction and company culture at <strong>eXp Realty</strong>. <strong>Real Broker</strong> has not yet made it onto this prestigious list.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-real-broker-brokerage-availability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248131\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/fe61936f9a140e79-Brokerage-Availability.png/public\" alt=\"a green tick in a check box\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Brokerage-Availability.png 256w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Brokerage-Availability-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs. Real Broker: Brokerage Availability</h2>\n<p>Another key factor when selecting a brokerage is where they operate. <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is active in <strong>50 states and 24 countries</strong>, with a powerful agent network of over <strong>80,000 agents</strong>. This international presence offers unmatched opportunities for agents to collaborate globally, expand their client base, and build referral relationships across the world.</p>\n<p>In comparison, <strong>Real Broker</strong> operates in <strong>50 states</strong> and <strong>2 countries</strong>, with around <strong>20,000 agents</strong>. While Real Broker is growing, it doesn’t yet match the global reach and network size of <strong>eXp Realty</strong>. For agents seeking wider opportunities and broader resources, <strong>eXp Realty’s</strong> expansive network is a huge advantage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-real-broker-brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a37cf1e2cc5b6038-Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs. Real Broker: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why does profitability matter to you as an agent? A financially stable brokerage can continue to invest in tools, training, and support for its agents. When brokerages struggle financially, they often start cutting back on resources or adding fees that affect your bottom line.</p>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> has posted <strong>19 quarters of earnings</strong> but with only <strong>1 profitable quarter</strong>, which raises questions about its long-term financial stability especially given the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/nar-changes-effecting-buyer-agents/\">new NAR rules</a>.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>—a profitability rate of <strong>75%</strong>. Additionally, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the past five years, signaling continued stability and growth.</p>\n<p>If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-real-broker-commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cf7f04b909c13ff1-Commission-Splits-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs. Real Broker: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>When it comes to commission splits, this is what agents often focus on most—it determines how much of your hard-earned commission stays with you.</p>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> offers agents an <strong>85/15 split</strong> until they hit their <strong>$12,000 cap</strong>, after which they keep 100% of their commission. Agents at Real can also earn up to <strong>$24,000 in company stock</strong> by meeting certain production milestones.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once they’ve paid <strong>$16,000 to the brokerage</strong> for the year, they move to 100% commission. Agents at <strong>eXp Realty</strong> also earn stock for reaching specific production goals, and agents can earn their <strong>$16,000 cap back</strong> in company stock.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-real-broker-fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs. Real Broker: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees are another important consideration when choosing a brokerage. At <strong>Real Broker</strong>, agents pay a <strong>$249 joining fee</strong>, along with a <strong>$750 annual fee</strong> that’s collected over the first three sales each year.</p>\n<p>There are no transaction fees until agents cap. <strong>eXp Realty</strong> keeps things straightforward, charging agents an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until they cap.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Real Broker</strong>, agents pay <strong>$30 per sale</strong> for E&#038;O insurance, which adds up over time but is manageable. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$750 for the year</strong>, you’re capped and don’t have to pay any more E&#038;O fees for the rest of the year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-real-broker-training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs. Real Broker: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>The right training and support can make all the difference, no matter where you are in your real estate career.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> offers agents access to <strong>50+ live training sessions each week</strong>, in addition to a massive on-demand library packed with resources for both new and experienced agents. New agents can get up to speed with the <strong>Fast Start program</strong>, while more experienced agents can take advantage of the <strong>Kick Start program</strong> to refine their skills and grow their business.</p>\n<p>On top of all that, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> from over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong>, so you’ll never be left without help.</p>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> offers around <strong>30+ live hours of training</strong> each week, but beyond that, information about support is unclear. If you’re looking for comprehensive, around-the-clock support, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> seems to have the edge.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-real-broker-technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs. Real Broker: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Staying competitive in the real estate market means having the best tech at your fingertips, and <strong>eXp Realty</strong> excels in this area with its fully virtual setup.</p>\n<p>Agents can do everything online, from attending training sessions to meeting with their broker, through the <strong>eXp World</strong> platform—a metaverse-style environment that allows real-time collaboration and interaction. Want more details? Check out our blog on <strong>eXp World</strong> here.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> provides agents with their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a powerful <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> loaded with customizable templates for social media, flyers, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Real Broker’s</strong> technology resources are less clear, and they don’t offer a <strong>metaverse-style environment</strong> like <strong>eXp World</strong>. Without detailed information on the tech available, it’s hard to draw a comparison, but <strong>eXp Realty’s</strong> extensive suite of tools is difficult to beat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-vs-real-broker-income-opportunities\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248130\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5e39c75302654f98-Income-Opportunities.png/public\" alt=\"a cartoon hand holding a green bag\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Income-Opportunities.png 256w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Income-Opportunities-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs. Real Broker: Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>When it comes to income opportunities, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> really shines, offering agents multiple ways to build long-term wealth. Beyond commission, agents can earn <strong>revenue share</strong>, receive <strong>stock production awards</strong>, and even purchase <strong>discounted stock</strong>—all designed to help agents grow their income and financial security.</p>\n<p>While <strong>Real Broker</strong> also offers <strong>stock awards</strong> and the ability to purchase <strong>discounted stock</strong>, the <strong>revenue share pool</strong> is much smaller, at approximately <strong>$43 million</strong>, compared to eXp’s larger pool of <strong>$204 million</strong>. Additionally, Real Broker charges a <strong>$175 annual fee</strong> plus a <strong>1.2% admin fee</strong> to participate in the revenue share program.</p>\n<p>Another notable difference is that <strong>eXp Realty agents</strong> can offer unique value to attract agents to their sponsor line, giving them the opportunity to differentiate themselves from other sponsors. <strong>Real Broker agents</strong>, on the other hand, don’t have the ability to offer exclusive value, as all sponsors provide the same resources.</p>\n<p>This entrepreneurial flexibility at <strong>eXp Realty</strong> gives agents an extra edge when it comes to building their <strong>revenue share</strong>.
