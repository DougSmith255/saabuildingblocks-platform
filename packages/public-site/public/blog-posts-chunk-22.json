Here’s how:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fee-transparency\">Fee Transparency</h3>\n<p>Now that buyer agents must have written<a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts/written-buyer-agreements-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> buyer agreements</a> in the form of a <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/the-facts/homebuyers-what-the-nar-settlement-means\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home buyer</a> representation agreement that lays out their fees, real estate buyer agent fees will be clear. With agents needing this agreement before showing a home, home buyers will have upfront knowledge about the fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"negotiation-power\">Negotiation Power</h3>\n<p>Instead of the fee being set by the home seller and offered to any agent through the MLS, buyers now can negotiate directly with their agent based on the value that their agent will provide.</p>\n<p>These changes are steps in the right direction, ensuring the process is more transparent and fair.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"misconceptions-about-buyer-agents\">Misconceptions About Buyer Agents</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents.webp\" alt=\"Misconceptions About Buyer Agents\" class=\"wp-image-246783\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents-300x78.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Misconceptions-About-Buyer-Agents-768x199.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>These new rules come at a time when many home buyers and sellers are undervaluing the role of buyer agents. They’re getting excited about the <strong>possibility of lower fees</strong>. After all, with home searches just a click away, it’s easy for them to think, “<strong>I’m doing all the work</strong> finding the home; the agent just opens the door and takes a big cut!”</p>\n<p>I understand where they’re coming from. Before becoming an agent, I thought the same way. And now that I’m in the business, I know that some agents really don’t bring enough value to justify their fees, so sometimes I was right in my assumptions.</p>\n<p>But here’s the reality: <strong>the old system didn’t help</strong>. Whether an agent was exceptional or just average, they got paid the same from the seller. But now, with these new NAR changes, buyer agents have to communicate the value they bring and justify their costs. The field just got a lot tougher, and that’s a good thing—fewer mediocre agents, more value for buyers!</p>\n<p>Before becoming an agent, part of the reason I undervalued buyer agents was because I didn’t realize a few key things: that Buyer Agents Work on Contingency; that the “big number” on the closing statement and on their TV screens when they watch Million Dollar Listing isn’t the agent’s take-home pay; or that Buyer agents handle about 100 tasks for their clients behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>These are all things you buyer agents out there now need to explain to home buyers. They really don’t know. Need some help with that?

A good buyer agent can save them money, reduce their risk, and give them a much better chance of landing their dream home, especially in a competitive market.</p>\n<p>And here’s the kicker—many of these <strong>DIY buyers think they’re saving money</strong>, but if things are playing out where you are the same way they are for me, listing agents are adding a fee in their contract with the seller to compensate them for doing some legwork that buyer agents would typically handle.</p>\n<p>Well, that’s fair, but DIY home buyers don’t realize that they aren’t saving what they think they are.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"history-of-buyer-agency\">History of Buyer Agency</h2>\n<p>So, how did we get here? With all the recent lawsuits, you likely know that real estate agent fees have hovered around <strong>5% or 6% for a long time</strong>. How long? Since the <strong>1940s</strong>.</p>\n<p>But there was a big difference back then. Back in the day, the full 5% or 6% went to the listing agent. That&#8217;s right—the listing agent pocketed the whole commission because there were no buyer agents.</p>\n<p>By the <strong>1960s</strong>, listing agents realized they could sell more homes by offering a portion of their commission to other agents who would bring in lots of potential buyers. These agents, known as sub-agents, worked under the listing agent’s wing, splitting the commission in exchange for helping to market and sell the home.</p>\n<p>Less money for the listing agent, sure, but also less work because the sub-agents handled a lot of the tasks. The trade-off made sense for listing agents.</p>\n<p>This arrangement worked for a while, but it came with a major flaw. The sub-agents, while helping buyers, were actually representing the seller’s interests, not the buyers’. Even if a sub-agent never met the seller, their legal responsibility was to the seller.</p>\n<p>This meant that buyers were often under the false impression that the agent showing them homes was working in their best interest when, in reality, they weren’t.</p>\n<p>In fact, a <strong>1983 FTC study</strong> revealed that 72% of buyers were under the false impression that the agents showing them homes were representing them.</p>\n<p>By the early <strong>1990s</strong>, this system started to crack under pressure. More and more buyers, realizing they had been left out in the cold without proper representation, began filing lawsuits.</p>\n<p>In response to these lawsuits, the real estate industry came up with a solution—buyer agency. This new model allowed buyer agents to have a fiduciary duty to the buyer, meaning they could truly represent the buyer’s best interests. And, listing agents continued to split their commission with these hardworking buyer agents who helped them sell the house.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-sellers-will-continue-to-pay-buyer-agents\">Why Sellers Will Continue to Pay Buyer Agents</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents.webp\" alt=\"Why Sellers Will Continue to Pay Buyer Agents\" class=\"wp-image-246785\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Why-Sellers-Will-Continue-to-Pay-Buyer-Agents-768x151.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>With these new NAR changes, life has become a bit easier for home sellers too. Now, sellers sign listing agreements where they’re only obligated to pay their own agent&#8217;s fees. This makes sense, right?</p>\n<p>But sellers can still agree, through negotiation with a home buyer, to cover the buyer agent’s fees too. The big question is, will they? I believe the answer is, of course they will! And here’s why:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Attracting Buyer Agents: Buyer agency started because home buyers needed real representation, but it also benefited sellers by attracting more buyers. That fundamental reason hasn’t changed.</li>\n<li>Maximizing Buyers&#8217; Budgets: When buyers put down larger down payments, they often qualify for lower interest rates, which saves them money and enables them to afford a more expensive home. Sellers want buyers to have more purchasing power, right?</li>\n<li>Tax Benefits: If sellers pay the buyer agent’s fees, it lowers their profit on paper, which can positively affect their taxes. So, there’s a financial incentive for sellers to consider covering those costs.</li>\n<li>Focus on Net Profit: At the day’s end, sellers only care about their net profit. It doesn’t matter whether they pay the buyer agent’s fee or not—it’s all about how much they walk away with after the sale.</li>\n<li>All this debate about whether sellers will pay is overblown. Even those who claim they’ll never pay a buyer agent’s fee will change their tune when they see they can net more money from the sale by doing so.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-the-new-rules-lead-to-lower-prices\">Will the New Rules Lead to Lower Prices?</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"204\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices.webp\" alt=\"Will the New NAR Changes Lead to Lower Prices\" class=\"wp-image-246786\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices-300x61.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Will-the-New-NAR-Changes-Lead-to-Lower-Prices-768x157.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>First off, they’ve already gone down. Th president of the National Association of Realtors said, the “Average commission in the U.S. fell to a new low of 4.94% in 2020.” So, fees already dropped since online searches became the norm after 2008.</p>\n<p>Will fees drop even more? My guess—not by much.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"impact-for-listing-agents\">Impact for Listing Agents</h3>\n<p>For listing agents, nothing has changed, except they can pick up a higher pay by charging the seller for unrepresented buyers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"full-service-buyer-agents-fees\">Full-Service Buyer Agents’ Fees</h3>\n<p>As for full-service buyer agents, we’ll probably keep charging 2.5-3% because, on average, we spend twice as much time per client as listing agents do. If we aren’t paid enough, it just doesn’t make sense for us to stay in the game.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"discount-agents\">Discount Agents</h3>\n<p>Buyers who want to save a buck can always go for discount agents, but you should let them know they’re likely sacrificing service quality. Evidence of that? Discount agents have been around for over a decade, and they haven’t taken over the industry. “Discount” is code for less service.</p>\n<p>However, the rise of unrepresented buyers might lower overall fees slightly, but not by 2.5-3%. Those unrepresented buyers will once again, just like back in the days when the listing agent made the whole 5 – 6%, be paying for the listing agent to cover some of the work a buyer agent would normally do.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if we soon see a wave of lawsuits from unrepresented buyers who didn’t fully understand the “cost” of going it alone or the risks of being taken advantage of. Sounds a lot like the 1990s all over again.</p>\n<p>So, while I don’t foresee a significant drop in agent fees, these changes are a huge win for home buyers. They now have a clearer understanding of what they’re paying for, and buyer agents need to step up and clearly explain the value they bring to the table.</p>\n<p>Agents who can’t or won’t do that will likely find themselves out of the business, which is ultimately great for the reputation of the real estate profession. So hang in there, communicate your value, and get ready for your greatest success ever.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>The recent NAR changes have increased transparency in real estate agent fees, requiring written agreements and giving buyers more negotiation power.</p>\n<p>While this could lead to misconceptions about the value of buyer agents, it also pushes agents to better communicate their worth.</p>\n<p>Despite some buyers attempting to bypass agents, the changes are unlikely to lead to a significant drop in overall fees. Ultimately, the new rules benefit both buyers and the industry by encouraging higher standards among real estate professionals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>By partnering with us, you’ll be joining the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\">ONLY profitable public brokerage in the past 5 years</a> that agents rank as the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>With Smart Agent Alliance</strong> you’ll enjoy personalized day-to-day concierge care plus assets like customizable agent presentations, business automation, production checklists, customizable social media posts, and <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/team-benefits/\">so much more.</a></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3.webp\" alt=\"Group photo of Wolf Pack team members at eXp CON\" class=\"wp-image-3493\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3.webp 960w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-768x432.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n<p>As a member of our team, you’ll also enjoy exclusive access to the <strong>Wolf Pack weekly webinars</strong>, <strong>Social Agent Academy</strong> for social media training, the <strong>Wolf Pack Hub</strong> for easy onboarding, Investor Army for investing and flipping houses training, and more.</p>\n<p>Don’t miss out on this amazing opportunity to maximize your earnings and build a thriving real estate business. <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-our-exp-realty-sponsor-team/\">Join eXp Realty today</a> and <strong>experience unparalleled support</strong> from our FREE team.</p>\n<p>Not quite convinced?

Total average fees will be lower due to home buyers taking on the extra risk of buying a home without an agent and maybe also from brand new agents giving discounts until they know their worth. But, it’s not likely full-service agents will drop their fees.</p>\n<p>Home buyers can also choose discount agents, but they always could.

Why? They&#8217;ve caught wind that they don&#8217;t need a buyer agent to check out a house.</p>\n<p>So, what happens when these eager buyers hit up listing agents to open doors for them? Well, the cool listing agents are staying in their lane and saying, “Nope, I don’t cover buyer agent duties.

They want into the house and signing seems like no biggie! Except it is.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why. Many listing agents charge their sellers an extra fee to handle unrepresented buyers – they aren’t going to do buyer agent work for free.</p>\n<p>If a buyer signs an unrepresented buyer agreement, then sees the light and hires a buyer agent to work the deal, depending on the listing agreement, that buyer might get slapped with both unrepresented buyer fees and buyer agent fees. Talk about a financial mess for buyers!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-can-you-do\">What can you do?</h3>\n<p><strong>Make some noise</strong> about this. Tell everyone that these unrepresented buyers are still coughing up cash through hidden fees tucked away in contracts they can’t see.

After all, you have already taught them so much!</p>\n<p>In California, the maximum term for a buyer representation agreement is three months. Kudos to you agents for getting clients into contracts in three months, but let’s be real—it often doesn’t happen that fast.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>We’re not fans of this new time cap, even though we let buyers cancel contracts anytime. Why? It’s tough when I’m pouring value into a client’s lap for them to face me and cancel our agreement. But if a contract just runs out of time, it’s easier for people to just do nothing and decide to go it alone. In that case, they don’t even need to talk to me.</p>\n<p>This leaves us in a <strong>bit of a bind</strong>: spill too much wisdom and you might just convince clients they can handle it solo; hold back, and they might think you’re not worth keeping around.</p>\n<p>Of course, we agents know unrepresented buyers are significantly disadvantaged by not working with a buyer agent and, worse, by getting played by savvy listing agents. However, buyers don’t seem to understand the disadvantages of having no representation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-2\">How to handle it? </h3>\n<p>Navigating this tightrope of upfront value, well that’s tricky. Honestly, I don’t think there’s any magic fix. Buckle up, it’s gonna be a wild ride.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-6-signed-unrepresented-buyer-agreement\">Buyer Agent Problem #6: Signed Unrepresented Buyer Agreement</h2>\n<p>I<strong>magine this:</strong> a buyer comes to you all excited, saying they’ve signed an unrepresented buyer agreement but now they’ve seen the light and want your help to buy the house. Awesome, right? Not so fast.</p>\n<p>If they’ve already signed off with a listing agent, there’s a good chance that the agent will pocket their “extra” unrepresented buyer fee, even if they don’t finish the work. That means your buyer could be on the hook for more fees than they expect.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-3\">How to handle it? </h3>\n<p><strong>Educate, educate, educate</strong> so that buyers don’t get in this pickle to start with. But, if it does happen to you, let your buyer know the problem, and then contact the listing agent to determine the level of the problem.</p>\n<p>Consider requesting that the listing agent amend their listing agreement. Or, you might consider lowering your own compensation if it means securing the best outcome for your client. In that case, hopefully, the listing agent already put in some hours that you would have done had the buyer contacted you originally.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-7-more-record-keeping\">Buyer Agent Problem #7: More Record Keeping</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Oh, the joys of NAR changes and paperwork!

Why? This rigorous paperwork is your best defense against any accusations of violating fair housing laws.</p>\n<p>The best new plan: Keep detailed records and stay consistent with your fees, no matter the client or situation.

And don’t sweat it if a buyer’s worried about affording your fee on their own.</p>\n<p>Most sellers will still see the <strong>value in footing the bill</strong> for buyer agents because it brings more buyers and potentially higher offers. Even stubborn sellers will change their tune when they see a net offer that outshines the rest.</p>\n<p>Second, make sure your offers include <strong>clear language</strong> about the seller covering the buyer agent fee. Something like, “Seller agrees to pay the buyer $x amount to meet buyer’s obligation to pay buyer agent”. </p>\n<p>Make sure you get this right for your state’s procedures.  Get it wrong and you may not get paid!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-9-need-to-warn-do-it-yourselfers\">Buyer Agent Problem #9: Need to Warn Do-It-Yourselfers</h2>\n<p>Here’s a hot take on these NAR changes: lots of buyers think they don’t need a buyer agent anymore—either because they believe agents <strong>just open doors</strong>, or they think they can’t afford one.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246490 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>It’s on you to set the record straight.

Buyers are signing because they want to get into the house. Buyers don’t know there is likely a cost to having no representation. That fee, negotiated between the listing agent and the seller, is hidden and it may be substantial. Buyers will often have worse outcomes, pay more and take on more risk, without a good buyer agent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-home-buyers-need-to-sign-agreements-to-see-an-open-house\">Do home buyers need to sign agreements to see an open house?</h3>\n<p>No, but open houses do give listing agents an edge to get naive home buyers to sign agreements like dual agency (where allowed), unrepresented buyer, or a single property buyer (when the open house agent is not the listing agent). Home buyers need to interview agents to find the best one. They should never sign a contract on the fly as there may be hidden fees and it’s not in their best interest. Open house visitors can see the home without signing any agreement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if-a-buyer-requests-a-home-showing-through-zillow-must-they-sign-a-buyer-representation-agreement\">If a buyer requests a home showing through Zillow must they sign a buyer representation agreement?</h3>\n<p>Yes, in the form of a 7-day touring agreement. Problem &#8211; if the buyer wants to immediately make an offer, they are stuck with the randomly assigned agent who is paying Zillow to get these leads. That agent may easily not be the best match to get the best outcome for the buyer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-home-sellers-keep-paying-for-buyer-agents\">Will home sellers keep paying for buyer agents?</h3>\n<p>Yes, most likely. In the end, sellers just want the highest net price for their home. It’s simple math.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if-a-home-buyer-signs-an-unrepresented-buyer-agreement-can-they-still-hire-a-buyer-agent\">If a home buyer signs an unrepresented buyer agreement, can they still hire a buyer agent?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but it may be costly because there is usually a hidden fee associated with these unrepresented buyer agreements and that fee may or may not end when the buyer decides they want their own buyer representation. Buyers can ask their agent to get the low down and work the issue with the listing agent for a potentially better client outcome.</p>\n",

can significantly influence a real estate agent’s career path, financial gains, and overall satisfaction. In this analysis, we’ll dive into the key differences between <strong>Real vs Fathom Realty</strong>, two leading players in the real estate industry. We’ll examine their foundational elements, financial performance, commission splits, income opportunities, training, and support systems, along with additional features that each offers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#overview\">Overview</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#financial-strength\">Financial Strength</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#additional-features\">Additional Features</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-fathom-realty\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Fathom Realty</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p><strong>Real</strong> was founded in 2014 and has quickly become a notable contender in the real estate brokerage industry with its innovative approach and cloud-based model. The brokerage boasts over 20,000 agents across 50 states, indicating a significant presence in the U.S. real estate market. Real&#8217;s Glassdoor rating stands at 4.5 from 109 reviews, highlighting strong agent satisfaction and a positive work environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, established in 2010, has developed a strong foundation with operations in 41 states and a network of over 11,000 agents. It enjoys a slightly higher Glassdoor rating of 4.6 from 425 reviews, reflecting a strong reputation for agent satisfaction and a supportive company culture.</p>\n<p>Both Real and Fathom Realty have carved out unique niches within the real estate sector, with Real focusing on rapid growth and technological solutions, while Fathom Realty emphasizes its extensive reach and agent-centric policies.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"financial-strength\">Financial Strength</h2>\n<p>When evaluating financial strength in <strong>Real vs Fathom Realty</strong>, there is a distinct contrast between the two. Real, listed under the ticker REAL, trades around $6 and has had only 1 profitable quarter out of 19. This suggests challenges in achieving consistent profitability, which might raise concerns for agents seeking stable, long-term financial growth.</p>\n<p>Fathom Realty, on the other hand, is publicly listed under the ticker FATH, trading around $2. Similar to Real, Fathom has also experienced only 1 profitable quarter, indicating financial hurdles in maintaining steady profitability.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages face financial challenges, but Fathom Realty has a more transparent track record due to its longer tenure in the industry. In contrast, Real&#8217;s position as a newer player might imply potential for growth, albeit with some financial instability.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>Commission splits and associated fees are pivotal factors in deciding between brokerages. <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> offers a 100/0 commission split, which is appealing to agents seeking to maximize their earnings without sharing a portion with the brokerage. This structure, however, comes without any top agent bonuses. Fathom Realty operates with a production cap of $0, which is advantageous for agents who wish to retain most of their commission earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>Real</strong>, meanwhile, provides an 85/15 to 100/0 commission split, allowing agents to start with a modest commission share and gradually earn more as they cap. Real’s production cap is set at $12K, which could be appealing for agents who can quickly reach this cap and enjoy higher commission retention. Additionally, Real offers a $24K elite agent bonus, serving as an incentive for high-performing agents to maximize their income potential.</p>\n<p>When comparing commission splits in Real vs Fathom Realty, Fathom’s 100/0 split offers agents the maximum possible commission retention, but lacks additional bonuses. Real’s flexible split structure, combined with bonus opportunities, might attract agents looking for a balanced approach between initial commission sharing and eventual high earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>Beyond traditional commissions, income opportunities can significantly impact an agent’s earnings. <strong>Real</strong> provides multiple avenues for supplementary income, including revenue sharing and stock awards. Agents can earn 150 shares upon annual capping and have the option to purchase discounted stock with a 5% pre-cap bonus and a 20% post-cap bonus. These features offer substantial financial growth potential, especially for agents interested in building wealth through stock ownership.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> does not provide revenue share income or stock awards, focusing solely on commission earnings. This lack of additional income streams might limit financial opportunities for agents who prefer diversified earning potential beyond commissions.</p>\n<p>The analysis of income opportunities in Real vs Fathom Realty highlights Real’s edge in offering revenue sharing and stock awards, which could be appealing for agents seeking to expand their income sources. Fathom Realty’s straightforward commission structure may suit those who prioritize simplicity over-diversification.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Training and support are vital aspects of any brokerage, significantly influencing an agent’s professional development and success. <strong>Real</strong> offers 30+ live training hours per week, ensuring agents have access to continuous learning and skill enhancement opportunities. However, it does not provide a virtual office environment, which could limit access to collaborative tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, similar to Real, does not offer a virtual office setup or structured live training sessions. While Fathom emphasizes agent satisfaction and community support, its lack of comprehensive training programs might be a drawback for agents accustomed to regular educational offerings.</p>\n<p>In the comparison of training and support between Real vs Fathom Realty, Real edges out slightly with its provision of live training sessions, albeit without a virtual office. Fathom’s higher Glassdoor rating might indicate stronger cultural satisfaction and support, but both brokerages have room for improvement in their training offerings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-features\">Additional Features</h2>\n<p>Additional features such as healthcare options, mentorship programs, and technological tools can significantly enhance an agent’s experience at a brokerage. <strong>Real</strong> offers healthcare options, which can be crucial for agents seeking comprehensive benefits beyond financial compensation. However, it lacks mentorship programs and does not provide a free sponsor value or partner networks to the extent seen in other brokerages.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, in contrast, offers healthcare options but also lacks mentorship programs and additional technological tools. The absence of these features might be a drawback for agents seeking a full-service brokerage with comprehensive support systems.</p>\n<p>In evaluating additional features in Real vs Fathom Realty, both brokerages have specific strengths but also areas where they could enhance their offerings. Real’s healthcare options and stock purchase programs may attract agents looking for added benefits, while Fathom’s established reputation and agent-centric culture could appeal to those seeking community support.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-fathom-realty\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Fathom Realty</h2>\n<p>The choice between <strong><a href=\"https://www.onereal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.fathomrealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fathom Realty</a></strong> hinges on individual agent priorities and career aspirations. <strong>Real</strong> offers a balanced approach with flexible commission splits, revenue sharing, and stock awards, making it attractive to agents seeking diversified income opportunities and growth potential.

    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Century 21 vs Coldwell Banker to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-century-21-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Century 21 vs Coldwell Banker</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Century 21 offers agent/broker commission splits ranging from 70/30 to 92/8, with an 8% franchise/royalty fee even after the cap is reached. This means that agents at Century 21 can retain between 70% to 92% of their commissions but must pay an 8% fee on their gross commission income regardless of their production level. In contrast, Coldwell Banker provides splits starting at 55/45 and going up to 90/10, with a franchise/royalty fee ranging from 5% to 6.5%. Therefore, agents at Coldwell Banker can retain between 55% to 90% of their commissions, subject to the franchise fee on their gross commission income.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees also differ significantly between the two brokerages. Century 21&#8217;s monthly fees range from $0 to $350, reflecting differences in local markets and office operating costs. Coldwell Banker has monthly fees ranging from $150 to $179. Additionally, Century 21 includes transaction fees within their royalty fees, simplifying the cost structure for agents, whereas Coldwell Banker includes transaction fees in their royalty fees, which can be more predictable and manageable for agents. Errors &#038; Omissions insurance at Coldwell Banker costs $300 per month, while it is not specified for Century 21. These differences can impact an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning, making it important to consider each brokerage&#8217;s fee structure carefully.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Unfortunately, neither Century 21 nor Coldwell Banker offers revenue share programs, retirement income paths, or willable income paths. This limitation means that agents are primarily reliant on their commission-based earnings. In contrast to some other brokerages that offer multiple streams of income, such as revenue sharing or passive income opportunities, Century 21 and Coldwell Banker focus solely on commission income.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Both Century 21 and Coldwell Banker provide training programs, but the quality and availability of these programs can vary by office. Century 21 offers training that varies by office, which might lead to inconsistencies in the quality of training received. Coldwell Banker also provides training that varies by office, which can be a drawback for agents who prefer a more consistent training experience. Neither brokerage offers 24/7 support, which can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development. The absence of round-the-clock support means that agents might need to rely on local office resources or peer networks for assistance outside of regular business hours. This can be a limitation for agents who need immediate support or who work in markets with extended hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Both Century 21 and Coldwell Banker incorporate technological tools to enhance agent productivity and client engagement. Century 21 offers a range of technology solutions tailored to various market needs, including marketing tools and CRM systems designed to streamline agent workflows. Coldwell Banker also invests in technology, providing agents with tools to manage leads, market properties, and streamline transactions effectively. However, the specific technology offerings can vary by office, reflecting differences in local market needs and office resources. Both brokerages provide valuable technological resources, but the specific tools and platforms offered may appeal differently depending on the agent’s needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Century 21 has a Glassdoor rating of 4.2 stars based on 1.5K reviews, indicating strong agent approval and satisfaction. The positive rating reflects Century 21&#8217;s support for agents and the resources available to them. Coldwell Banker holds a slightly higher rating of 4.3 stars from 2.6K reviews, suggesting relatively higher agent satisfaction. The higher rating for Coldwell Banker may reflect its broader market reach, diverse training opportunities, and support resources. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-century-21-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Century 21 vs Coldwell Banker</h2>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.century21.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Century 21</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coldwellbankerhomes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coldwell Banker</a>, it’s evident that each brokerage has its strengths and weaknesses. Century 21 offers a strong brand, support for various market specialists, and a simplified cost structure with inclusive transaction fees. However, its fixed franchise fee even after the cap may not appeal to all agents, and the variability in training quality can be a drawback.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers a broader market reach, consistent support, and a higher overall agent satisfaction rating. However, the additional transaction fees and monthly fees can impact net income, and the variability in training quality across offices can be a concern. Both brokerages lack supplementary income opportunities such as revenue sharing, which might limit long-term financial growth for agents.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison and to find the best brokerage for your needs, check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.

Despite its short history, Real Broker has expanded significantly, operating in all 50 states with a growing network of over 20,000 agents. It boasts a Glassdoor rating of 4.5 from 109 reviews, reflecting a positive agent experience.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong>, established in 2021, is an even newer player but has also made rapid strides. Currently, LPT Realty operates in 24 states with over 11,000 agents and has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 from 37 reviews. While both brokerages are relatively young, Real Broker&#8217;s slightly longer presence and higher agent count might suggest a more established operational framework.</p>\n<p>In the comparison of <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, both brokerages show promising growth and positive agent feedback, with Real Broker having a slight edge in agent count and state coverage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"financial-strength\">Financial Strength</h2>\n<p>When evaluating financial strength in <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, profitability and financial stability are key considerations. Real Broker is publicly listed under the ticker REAL, trading around $6. It has experienced only 1 profitable quarter compared to 18 non-profitable ones, indicating challenges in maintaining steady financial performance.</p>\n<p>LPT Realty is not publicly listed, so detailed financial data is not readily available. This lack of transparency might concern agents looking for a clear understanding of their brokerage’s financial health.</p>\n<p>In comparing the financial strength of <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, Real Broker’s public listing offers transparency despite its financial struggles, whereas LPT Realty’s financial status remains somewhat opaque but might still offer competitive advantages through its rapid expansion and innovative business model.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>Commission splits and associated fees are pivotal factors in deciding between brokerages. <strong>Real Broker</strong> offers an 85/15 to 100/0 commission split with a $12K production cap, plus a $24K elite agent bonus. This structure allows agents to start with a modest commission share and gradually earn more as they cap, with additional financial incentives for high-performing agents.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> provides an 80/20 to 100/0 commission split with varied production caps of $15K under the Revenue Share Partner (RSP) model or $5K under the Business Builder (BB) model. LPT Realty also offers stock for top agent bonuses, adding another layer of financial incentive.</p>\n<p>In comparing commission splits in <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, both brokerages offer flexible split structures with potential high earnings for capping agents. However, Real Broker’s elite agent bonus and clear cap structure might appeal to agents looking for defined financial milestones, while LPT Realty’s dual cap options and stock awards provide varied paths to maximize earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>Beyond traditional commissions, income opportunities can significantly impact an agent’s earnings. <strong>Real Broker</strong> provides multiple income streams, including revenue sharing and stock awards. Agents can earn 150 shares for annual capping and have options for purchasing discounted stock, offering substantial financial growth potential.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> similarly offers revenue sharing and stock awards, with agents earning 75 (BB) or 150 (RSP) shares for their first sale and additional shares for subsequent sales. These features offer substantial financial growth potential, especially for agents interested in building wealth through stock ownership.</p>\n<p>The analysis of income opportunities in <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong> highlights that both brokerages provide diversified earning potential. Real Broker’s structured stock awards and discounted stock purchase options might appeal to agents looking for predictable financial incentives, while LPT Realty’s varied stock award structure offers flexibility and additional financial benefits.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Training and support are vital aspects of any brokerage, significantly influencing an agent’s professional development and success. <strong>Real Broker</strong> offers 30+ live training hours per week, providing agents with ample opportunities for professional growth and development.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong>, on the other hand, does not offer structured live training sessions but provides financial incentives through its commission splits and revenue sharing models.</p>\n<p>In the comparison of training and support between <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, Real Broker’s structured training programs offer a clear advantage for agents seeking regular educational opportunities. LPT Realty’s financial incentives might still attract self-driven agents who prioritize earning potential over formal training.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-features\">Additional Features</h2>\n<p>Additional features such as healthcare options, mentorship programs, and technological tools can significantly enhance an agent’s experience at a brokerage. <strong>Real Broker</strong> offers healthcare options and mentorship programs with a commission split of 50/50 to 70/30 for the first three sales, along with a virtual office environment.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> does not provide healthcare options or mentorship programs, focusing instead on its revenue sharing and stock award structures.</p>\n<p>In evaluating additional features in <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, Real Broker’s comprehensive support systems, including healthcare and mentorship, provide a more holistic agent experience. LPT Realty’s innovative financial models and stock awards offer significant financial incentives but lack additional support structures.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-lpt-realty\">Final Thoughts on Real vs LPT Realty</h2>\n<p>The choice between <strong><a href=\"https://www.onereal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.lpt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LPT Realty</a></strong> hinges on individual agent priorities and career aspirations. <strong>Real Broker</strong> offers a balanced approach with flexible commission splits, structured training, and comprehensive support systems, making it attractive to agents seeking a full-service brokerage with clear financial incentives.

Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Age Requirement</h3>\n<p>To be eligible for a real estate license in Oklahoma, you must be at least 18 years old. This age requirement ensures that applicants have reached the level of maturity and legal responsibility necessary for the profession.</p>\n<p>While you don’t need to be an Oklahoma resident to apply for a real estate license, you must have a valid Social Security number. This is essential for background checks and compliance with state regulations. Non-residents are held to the same standards as Oklahoma residents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background Check Requirements</h3>\n<p>In the real estate field, ethical behavior is vital. The Oklahoma Real Estate Commission will perform a thorough background check on all applicants. Any criminal history could result in the denial of your license application. However, being transparent about any past legal issues and demonstrating rehabilitation efforts can improve your chances of approval.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pre-licensing-education\">Pre-Licensing Education</h2>\n<p>In Oklahoma, prospective real estate agents must complete 90 hours of pre-licensing education. This course is designed to cover the essential topics needed to thoroughly prepare you for the licensing exam and your future career in real estate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What the Course Covers</h3>\n<p>The Oklahoma pre-licensing course includes in-depth instruction on various critical areas of real estate. This includes a focus on Real Estate Principles and Practices, Oklahoma Real Estate, Real Estate Finance, and other topics, providing you with the comprehensive knowledge needed for success in the profession.</p>\n<p>This portion of the course covers the foundational principles of real estate, including property rights, contracts, and land use. The course ensures you understand the role of a real estate agent and the dynamics of the Oklahoma real estate market.</p>\n<p>The course dives into Oklahoma-specific real estate laws, emphasizing the regulations that govern real estate transactions in the state. Topics include the Oklahoma Real Estate License Code and Rules, as well as federal laws like the Fair Housing Act.</p>\n<p>This segment of the course covers the basics of real estate finance, including mortgages, loan processing, and financial instruments used in real estate transactions. Understanding these concepts is crucial for guiding clients through the financial aspects of buying and selling property.</p>\n<p>The curriculum also includes other relevant topics such as real estate appraisal, closing procedures, and professional ethics, all tailored to meet Oklahoma’s requirements.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"choosing-a-real-estate-school\">Choosing a Real Estate School</h2>\n<p>Selecting the right real estate school is crucial. Look for accredited schools that offer flexibility, especially if you have a busy schedule. Online courses can provide the convenience of studying at your own pace.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Research Schools</h3>\n<p>Start by researching various real estate schools and reading reviews from past students. Look for schools with high pass rates for the real estate exam and positive feedback on their teaching methods.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Online vs In-Person Classes</h3>\n<p>Decide whether you prefer online or in-person classes. Online courses offer flexibility and convenience, allowing you to study at your own pace. In-person classes provide direct interaction with instructors and peers, which can enhance your learning experience.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evaluate Course Materials</h3>\n<p>Evaluate the course materials and support services provided by the school. High-quality textbooks, interactive lessons, and access to instructors for questions can significantly impact your success. Some schools also offer additional resources like exam prep courses and study groups.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Study Tips</h3>\n<p>Create a daily study schedule that covers all exam topics, ensuring regular review sessions. (<a href=\"https://asana.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Asana provides a great FREE task manager</a>)</p>\n<p>Utilize flashcards for key terms and concepts to enhance memorization.

Make sure all required fields are accurately completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Gather Required Documents:</strong> Collect necessary documents such as proof of your completed pre-licensing education, valid identification, and any additional forms required by OREC.</p>\n<p><strong>Submit Your Application:</strong> Submit your completed application and all required documents electronically through OREC’s online portal.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay the Application Fee: </strong>During the submission process, be sure to pay the required application fee, which is approximately $35 for the Sales Associate license.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Application Processing Time</h3>\n<p>The Oklahoma Real Estate Commission generally takes several weeks to process applications. During this period, they will review your educational credentials and verify that all requirements have been satisfied. To avoid any delays, double-check your application for accuracy before submission.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Track Your Application</h3>\n<p>You can monitor the status of your application online via the OREC website. Regularly checking your status will keep you updated on any additional steps or issues that may arise. If delays occur, contacting the Commission directly can help resolve any concerns.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pass-the-real-estate-exam\">Pass the Real Estate Exam</h2>\n<p>The Oklahoma Real Estate Exam is a comprehensive test that lasts 3 hours and consists of 120 multiple-choice questions. To pass, you need to achieve a score of at least 70%. If you do not pass on your first attempt, you will need to submit a new application and pay the exam fee of $61 for each attempt.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Property Ownership</strong>: 8%</li>\n<li><strong>Land Use Controls and Regulations</strong>: 5%</li>\n<li><strong>General Principles of Agency</strong>: 13%</li>\n<li><strong>Property Disclosure</strong>: 6%</li>\n<li><strong>Leasing and Property Management</strong>: 3%</li>\n<li><strong>Practice of Real Estate</strong>: 13%</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Valuation and Market Analysis</strong>: 7%</li>\n<li><strong>Financing</strong>: 10%</li>\n<li><strong>Contracts</strong>: 17%</li>\n<li><strong>Transfer of Title</strong>: 8%</li>\n<li><strong>Real Estate Calculations</strong>: 10%</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Laws and Rules Affecting Oklahoma Real Estate Practice</li>\n<li>Oklahoma Broker Relationships Act</li>\n<li>Property Management</li>\n<li>Disclosures and Hazards</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exam Preparation Tips</h3>\n<p>Go over the textbooks and notes from your pre-license courses.

Focus on areas where you feel less confident to ensure a well-rounded preparation.</p>\n<p>Take as many practice exams as possible. This helps you get familiar with the exam format and identify areas where you need more study. Practice exams can also help you manage your time effectively during the actual test.

Discussing topics with peers can enhance understanding and retention. Study groups provide a platform to share knowledge, ask questions, and support each other.</p>\n<p>Consider enrolling in an exam prep course for additional support and structured study. These courses often include practice exams, study guides, and expert instruction. Investing in a prep course can increase your chances of passing the exam on the first attempt.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exam Day Tips</h3>\n<p>Ensure you arrive at the exam center early to avoid any last-minute stress. Arriving early gives you time to settle in and focus before the exam begins.

Having all necessary documents ready can prevent any issues at the exam center.</p>\n<p>Read each question carefully and manage your time wisely. Staying calm and composed can help you think clearly and avoid mistakes. Take deep breaths and stay positive throughout the exam.</p>\n<p>Follow all instructions given by the exam proctors. Adhering to the rules ensures a smooth and fair testing experience for everyone. If you have any questions or issues, ask the proctors for assistance.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"complete-fingerprinting-background-check\">Complete Fingerprinting &#038; Background Check</h2>\n<p>After you pass the real estate exam, the next step is to complete the fingerprinting requirement as part of the mandatory criminal background check. This process is crucial to ensure you meet the integrity and honesty standards set by the Oklahoma Real Estate Commission.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scheduling Your Fingerprinting</h3>\n<p>Before scheduling your fingerprinting appointment, ensure you’ve received an email from OREC confirming that your application has been received and that you’re eligible for the background check.</p>\n<p>Once confirmed, schedule your fingerprinting appointment through any state-approved fingerprinting service provider. This may include authorized locations such as some UPS stores. It’s crucial to verify that the provider is recognized by OREC to avoid any processing issues.</p>\n<p>Attend your fingerprinting appointment at the selected location. Be sure to bring the required identification and confirmation documents as specified by the service provider.</p>\n<p>The fingerprinting process involves a fee, which is typically paid at the time of your appointment. Ensure you check the accepted payment methods and the exact fee with your chosen provider.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background Check Process</h3>\n<p>The Oklahoma Real Estate Commission (OREC) will conduct a background check using your fingerprints to verify that you meet the required ethical standards. This process is crucial in ensuring that all applicants adhere to the integrity and honesty expectations set by OREC. If any concerns are identified during this background check, you may need to provide additional documentation or take specific actions to resolve these issues before your license can be issued.</p>\n<p>If any issues are flagged during your background check, you may need to provide additional documentation or explanations. Being transparent about any past legal matters and supplying thorough documentation can help resolve concerns. If you have any doubts, consulting with legal counsel can provide guidance on navigating the process.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"submit-your-sales-associate-license-application\">Submit Your Sales Associate License Application</h2>\n<p>After completing the exam and fingerprinting requirements, the next crucial step is to submit your Sales Associate License Application to the Oklahoma Real Estate Commission (OREC) to confirm your eligibility.</p>\n<p>Fill out the Sales Associate License Application form available on the OREC website.

Today, we’ve got fantastic news! That is, it turns out there’s one overriding principle that can transform all your real estate agent marketing efforts into pure magic. Yay!</p>\n<p>In this blog, we’ll uncover this golden principle and show you how to seamlessly integrate it into your real estate marketing strategies. Ready for some marketing wizardry? Here’s your handy dandy index of what’s to follow:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#watch-the-you-tube-version\">The Golden Principle</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#shift-your-mindset-to-giving\">Shift Your Mindset to Giving?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#when-and-where-to-provide-value\">When &#038; Where to Provide Value?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#what-value-to-provide\">What Value to Provide?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#value-primarily-for-home-buyers\">Value Primarily for Home Buyers?</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#value-primarily-for-home-sellers\">Value Primarily for Home Sellers?</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#value-for-both-home-buyers-and-home-sellers\">Value for Both Home Buyers and Home Sellers?</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-group-at-exp-realty-for-more-detailed-training-from-rock-star-producers\">Join our FREE Group at eXp Realty</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"watch-the-you-tube-version\"><span style=\"color: revert; font-weight: revert;\">The Golden Principle</span></h2>\n<p>Without further undue, let’s uncover this magical principle in real estate agent marketing. Ready? It’s super simple! It’s all about providing value to prospects and clients.</p>\n<p>Not just any value. It’s about offering free value—no strings attached. Make sure there’s not even a hint of expecting payment in return. You’ll provide just pure, helpful, no-strings-attached information. Give away what you’ve got for free, and watch prospects turn into paying clients.</p>\n<p>Why does this work? Because people don’t like real estate agent marketing sales tactics, pushy or not. And, they don’t care about your latest closing, how much GCI you racked up, or how much you protest that you’re an excellent, experienced agent.</p>\n<p>What prospects and clients do care about is real estate agent marketing which brings value to the table. So give them value upfront, and you’ll have prospects knocking at your door, eager to become your clients.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shift-your-mindset-to-giving\">Shift Your Mindset to Giving</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-244071\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Shift-Your-Mindset-to-Giving-1.webp\" alt=\"Real Estate Agent Marketing - Mindset puzzle piece highlighting the shift to a giving mindset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"275\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Shift-Your-Mindset-to-Giving-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Shift-Your-Mindset-to-Giving-1-300x83.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Shift-Your-Mindset-to-Giving-1-768x211.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Switching your mindset from real estate agent marketing which is all about sales to giving away real value instead. This is a total game-changer. It&#8217;s about genuinely helping your clients rather than just looking to close a deal.</p>\n<p>By offering insider tips, market insights, and valuable resources freely, you position yourself as a giver, not just a salesperson.</p>\n<p>This approach enhances your credibility and it also makes your interactions more satisfying and fulfilling. Prospects and clients appreciate agents who genuinely care and aren&#8217;t just after a quick buck.</p>\n<p>Embracing this value-driven mindset can turn one-time clients into lifelong fans who are eager to refer you to others, boosting your career sustainability. So, forget the selling! Adopt a mindset of giving real value, and watch your professional relationships, personal satisfaction, and deals grow.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-and-where-to-provide-value\">When &#038; Where to Provide Value</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-244070\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/When-Where-to-Provide-Value-1.webp\" alt=\"Real Estate Agent Marketing - Hands nurturing a small plant, representing providing value\" width=\"1000\" height=\"272\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/When-Where-to-Provide-Value-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/When-Where-to-Provide-Value-1-300x82.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/When-Where-to-Provide-Value-1-768x209.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p><strong>When:</strong> All the time!</p>\n<p><strong>Where</strong>: Everywhere you can.

This checklist helps clients stay organized during their move.</p>\n<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A detailed list of tasks to be completed before, during, and after their move.

This list helps ensure a smooth transition.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find It:</strong> Moving companies’ websites, real estate blogs, and home improvement sites like<a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/c/ab/moving-checklist/9ba683603be9fa5395fab901e92cbf83\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Home Depot</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Provide It:</strong> Design an easy-to-follow checklist using tools like Canva or Google Docs.

crucial for a real estate agent&#8217;s career, influencing their financial success, professional growth, and overall job satisfaction. In this comparison, we will delve into the key aspects of <strong>LPT vs Fathom Realty</strong>, focusing on their foundation, financial strength, commission structures, income opportunities, training, support, and additional features.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#overview\">Overview</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#financial-strength\">Financial Strength</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#additional-features\">Additional Features</a></div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-fathom-realty\">Final Thoughts</a></div>\n<p><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></p>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> was founded in 2021, making it a relatively new player in the real estate industry. Despite its recent establishment, LPT Realty has made significant strides, currently operating in 24 states with over 11,000 agents. The brokerage has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 from 37 reviews, indicating a positive agent experience, though with a smaller sample size compared to older brokerages.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, established in 2010, boasts a more extensive presence, operating in 41 states with a network of over 11,000 agents. It enjoys a higher Glassdoor rating of 4.6 from 425 reviews, reflecting strong agent satisfaction and a supportive company culture developed over a longer period.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages have carved out distinct niches within the real estate sector, with LPT Realty focusing on rapid expansion and innovative approaches, while Fathom Realty emphasizes its extensive reach and agent-centric policies.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"financial-strength\">Financial Strength</h3>\n<p>When evaluating financial strength in <strong>LPT vs Fathom Realty</strong>, it is essential to consider profitability and financial stability. LPT Realty is not publicly listed, so detailed financial data is not readily available. This lack of transparency might be a concern for agents looking for a clear understanding of their brokerage’s financial health.</p>\n<p>Fathom Realty, on the other hand, is publicly listed under the ticker FATH, trading around $2. Similar to many newer brokerages, Fathom has experienced only 1 profitable quarter, indicating financial challenges in maintaining steady profitability.</p>\n<p>While LPT Realty’s financial status remains somewhat opaque, Fathom Realty’s publicly available financial records provide a clearer, albeit challenging, financial outlook. Agents might find Fathom’s transparency more reassuring, despite its profitability struggles.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Commission splits and associated fees are pivotal factors in deciding between brokerages. <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> offers a 100/0 commission split, which is appealing to agents seeking to maximize their earnings without sharing a portion with the brokerage. This structure, however, comes without any top agent bonuses. Fathom Realty operates with a production cap of $0, which is advantageous for agents who wish to retain most of their commission earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> provides an 80/20 to 100/0 commission split, allowing agents to start with a modest commission share and gradually earn more as they cap. LPT Realty’s production cap varies, with agents potentially capping at $15K under the Revenue Share Partner (RSP) model or at $5K under the Business Builder (BB) model. Additionally, LPT Realty offers stock for top agent bonuses, adding an incentive for high-performing agents to maximize their income potential.</p>\n<p>In comparing commission splits in LPT vs Fathom Realty, Fathom’s 100/0 split offers agents the maximum possible commission retention but lacks additional bonuses. LPT Realty’s flexible split structure, combined with bonus opportunities, might attract agents looking for a balanced approach between initial commission sharing and eventual high earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Beyond traditional commissions, income opportunities can significantly impact an agent’s earnings. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> provides multiple avenues for supplementary income, including revenue sharing and stock awards. Agents can earn 75 (BB) or 150 (RSP) shares for their first sale, and additional shares for subsequent sales. These features offer substantial financial growth potential, especially for agents interested in building wealth through stock ownership.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> does not provide revenue share income or stock awards, focusing solely on commission earnings. This lack of additional income streams might limit financial opportunities for agents who prefer diversified earning potential beyond commissions.</p>\n<p>The analysis of income opportunities in LPT vs Fathom Realty highlights LPT Realty’s edge in offering revenue sharing and stock awards, which could be appealing for agents seeking to expand their income sources. Fathom Realty’s straightforward commission structure may suit those who prioritize simplicity over-diversification.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Training and support are vital aspects of any brokerage, significantly influencing an agent’s professional development and success. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> does not offer structured live training sessions or a virtual office environment. However, its commission splits and revenue-sharing models provide financial incentives for agents to perform well.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, similar to LPT Realty, does not offer a virtual office setup or structured live training sessions. While Fathom emphasizes agent satisfaction and community support, its lack of comprehensive training programs might be a drawback for agents accustomed to regular educational offerings.</p>\n<p>In the comparison of training and support between LPT vs Fathom Realty, both brokerages have room for improvement in their training offerings. Fathom’s higher Glassdoor rating might indicate stronger cultural satisfaction and support, but LPT Realty’s innovative financial models offer incentives for self-driven agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-features\">Additional Features</h3>\n<p>Additional features such as healthcare options, mentorship programs, and technological tools can significantly enhance an agent’s experience at a brokerage. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> does not provide healthcare options, mentorship programs, or extensive technological tools, focusing instead on its revenue sharing and stock award structures.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, in contrast, offers healthcare options but also lacks mentorship programs and additional technological tools. The absence of these features might be a drawback for agents seeking a full-service brokerage with comprehensive support systems.</p>\n<p>In evaluating additional features in LPT vs Fathom Realty, both brokerages have specific strengths but also areas where they could enhance their offerings. LPT Realty’s revenue sharing and stock purchase programs may attract agents looking for added financial benefits, while Fathom’s established reputation and agent-centric culture could appeal to those seeking community support.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-fathom-realty\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Fathom Realty</h2>\n<p>The choice between <strong><a href=\"https://www.lpt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LPT</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.fathomrealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fathom Realty</a></strong> hinges on individual agent priorities and career aspirations. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> offers a balanced approach with flexible commission splits, revenue sharing, and stock awards, making it attractive to agents seeking diversified income opportunities and growth potential.

Its established presence and agent-centric culture provide stability and support, which can be appealing for agents prioritizing simplicity and community engagement.</p>\n<p>In weighing the factors of <strong>LPT vs Fathom Realty</strong>, agents should consider which brokerage aligns best with their financial goals, support needs, and overall career vision. Both brokerages offer unique advantages, and the decision ultimately rests on whether an agent values diversified income streams and financial incentives or prefers a no-commission-sharing approach with a strong community focus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.
