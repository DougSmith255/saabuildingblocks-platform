Why? They&#8217;ve caught wind that they don&#8217;t need a buyer agent to check out a house.</p>\n<p>So, what happens when these eager buyers hit up listing agents to open doors for them? Well, the cool listing agents are staying in their lane and saying, “Nope, I don’t cover buyer agent duties. Go find one.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>But some listing agents, where it’s legal, are scooping up these buyers with <strong>dual agency</strong> representation – you know that type of representation that really results in no representation but costs the same as a buyer agent. And, other listing agents are encouraging buyers to sign a simple <strong>unrepresented buyer agreement</strong> just so the buyers can take a peek inside the house.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-1-Listing-Agent-Contact-Advantage.webp\" alt=\"real estate buyer agent problems are unbalanced now, displayed through a close-up of a balance\" class=\"wp-image-246491 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-1-Listing-Agent-Contact-Advantage.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-1-Listing-Agent-Contact-Advantage-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Think buyers will quickly sign these agreements without thinking much about it?  Yes, of course, they will. They want into the house and signing seems like no biggie! Except it is.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s why. Many listing agents charge their sellers an extra fee to handle unrepresented buyers – they aren’t going to do buyer agent work for free.</p>\n<p>If a buyer signs an unrepresented buyer agreement, then sees the light and hires a buyer agent to work the deal, depending on the listing agreement, that buyer might get slapped with both unrepresented buyer fees and buyer agent fees. Talk about a financial mess for buyers!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-can-you-do\">What can you do?</h3>\n<p><strong>Make some noise</strong> about this. Tell everyone that these unrepresented buyers are still coughing up cash through hidden fees tucked away in contracts they can’t see. They’re not saving what they think and they’re giving up a lot of buyer agent advantages.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-2-listing-agent-open-house-edge\">Buyer Agent Problem #2: Listing Agent Open House Edge</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, direct phone calls from home buyers to listing agents are not the only way listing agents get the upper hand with the new NAR changes. Their open houses pull in loads of potential buyers too.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s another trap for buyers.</strong> Unscrupulous or naïve open house agents (who are not always the listing agents) may lead visitors into thinking they need to sign a representation agreement right then and there to tour the place.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-2-Listing-Agent-Open-House-Edge.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246486 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-2-Listing-Agent-Open-House-Edge.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-2-Listing-Agent-Open-House-Edge-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Not true! Since the new rules don&#8217;t apply to seller agents (or any agent sitting at an open house), no one needs to sign anything to stroll through an open house.</p>\n<p>But if a house hunter wants the lowdown on some insider info about the property, an open house agent might say, &#8220;Sorry, can’t share that unless you sign up with me.&#8221;  Good for home buyers? <strong>No way!</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Home buyers should take the time to find the best agent to represent them. Signing on the spot doesn’t do that.  But will people sign? Of course, they will because that’s the quickest way to get answers to their burning property questions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it\">How to handle it?</h3>\n<p>Spread the word loud and clear: signing on the fly is risky business. Urge potential buyers to take their time to really get what value an agent brings before they sign anything.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-3-zillow-and-similar-lead-providers\">Buyer Agent Problem #3: Zillow &#038; Similar Lead Providers</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Now onto Zillow, which due to the NAR changes, has started requiring callers interested in a property to sign a <strong>7-day non-exclusive touring agreement</strong>. Potential buyers might shrug and sign, thinking, “It’s just a week.”</p>\n<p>But here’s the twist: if they fall for the property and need to act fast, they&#8217;re stuck with that agent to make the quick offer. And let’s face it, not all agents are created equal—especially not the ones paying for those leads.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-3-Zillow-Similar-Lead-Providers.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246487 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-3-Zillow-Similar-Lead-Providers.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-3-Zillow-Similar-Lead-Providers-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-1\">How to handle it?</h3>\n<p>Well, there’s not much you can do except to teach the huge importance of buyers taking time to choose the best agent for them based on their due diligence, not on some random agent assigned to open the door.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-4-getting-signed-agreements\">Buyer Agent Problem #4: Getting Signed Agreements</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s cut to the chase on this one—we’ve already chatted about it in blogs and videos about <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/buyer-agent-presentation/\"><strong>Real Estate Buyer Agent Consultations</strong></a><strong> and “10 Realtor Questions to Expect from Home Buyers”.</strong></p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that this new NAR change hurdle is lower than you may think.  All you need to do is break down what you do, the unique value you bring, your commission fees, and how your buyer agent compensation works.</p>\n<p>What’s the best way to do that? Whip up an awesome buyer presentation. Spell it all out. Remember, lots of people think buyer agents are just door openers. So, in your presentation, make sure to list out the roughly <strong>100 tasks</strong> you tackle for buyers.</p>\n<p>Need a cheat sheet?

After all, you have already taught them so much!</p>\n<p>In California, the maximum term for a buyer representation agreement is three months. Kudos to you agents for getting clients into contracts in three months, but let’s be real—it often doesn’t happen that fast.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>We’re not fans of this new time cap, even though we let buyers cancel contracts anytime. Why? It’s tough when I’m pouring value into a client’s lap for them to face me and cancel our agreement. But if a contract just runs out of time, it’s easier for people to just do nothing and decide to go it alone. In that case, they don’t even need to talk to me.</p>\n<p>This leaves us in a <strong>bit of a bind</strong>: spill too much wisdom and you might just convince clients they can handle it solo; hold back, and they might think you’re not worth keeping around.</p>\n<p>Of course, we agents know unrepresented buyers are significantly disadvantaged by not working with a buyer agent and, worse, by getting played by savvy listing agents. However, buyers don’t seem to understand the disadvantages of having no representation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-2\">How to handle it? </h3>\n<p>Navigating this tightrope of upfront value, well that’s tricky. Honestly, I don’t think there’s any magic fix. Buckle up, it’s gonna be a wild ride.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-6-signed-unrepresented-buyer-agreement\">Buyer Agent Problem #6: Signed Unrepresented Buyer Agreement</h2>\n<p>I<strong>magine this:</strong> a buyer comes to you all excited, saying they’ve signed an unrepresented buyer agreement but now they’ve seen the light and want your help to buy the house. Awesome, right? Not so fast.</p>\n<p>If they’ve already signed off with a listing agent, there’s a good chance that the agent will pocket their “extra” unrepresented buyer fee, even if they don’t finish the work. That means your buyer could be on the hook for more fees than they expect.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-handle-it-3\">How to handle it? </h3>\n<p><strong>Educate, educate, educate</strong> so that buyers don’t get in this pickle to start with. But, if it does happen to you, let your buyer know the problem, and then contact the listing agent to determine the level of the problem.</p>\n<p>Consider requesting that the listing agent amend their listing agreement. Or, you might consider lowering your own compensation if it means securing the best outcome for your client. In that case, hopefully, the listing agent already put in some hours that you would have done had the buyer contacted you originally.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-7-more-record-keeping\">Buyer Agent Problem #7: More Record Keeping</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Oh, the joys of NAR changes and paperwork! But seriously, keeping <strong>meticulous records</strong> is now more crucial than ever for buyer agents. When you’re juggling non-exclusive representation agreements, you’ve got to keep tabs on who saw what property and when.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-7-More-Record-Keeping.webp\" alt=\"real estate buyer agent problems displayed by a man leaning on a stack of paperwork.\" class=\"wp-image-246489 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-7-More-Record-Keeping.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-7-More-Record-Keeping-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>This isn’t just busywork—it’s about clarity and keeping things above board in your representation dealings.</p>\n<p>And here’s <strong>another wrinkle</strong>: if your clients end up being charged different fees—maybe because a seller’s only covering part of your fee—you better document every detail. Why? This rigorous paperwork is your best defense against any accusations of violating fair housing laws.</p>\n<p>The best new plan: Keep detailed records and stay consistent with your fees, no matter the client or situation. It’s your safeguard in this tricky business.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-8-getting-paid\">Buyer Agent Problem #8: Getting Paid</h2>\n<p>First off, nail down a buyer representation contract that spells out your fee. And don’t sweat it if a buyer’s worried about affording your fee on their own.</p>\n<p>Most sellers will still see the <strong>value in footing the bill</strong> for buyer agents because it brings more buyers and potentially higher offers. Even stubborn sellers will change their tune when they see a net offer that outshines the rest.</p>\n<p>Second, make sure your offers include <strong>clear language</strong> about the seller covering the buyer agent fee. Something like, “Seller agrees to pay the buyer $x amount to meet buyer’s obligation to pay buyer agent”. </p>\n<p>Make sure you get this right for your state’s procedures.  Get it wrong and you may not get paid!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"buyer-agent-problem-9-need-to-warn-do-it-yourselfers\">Buyer Agent Problem #9: Need to Warn Do-It-Yourselfers</h2>\n<p>Here’s a hot take on these NAR changes: lots of buyers think they don’t need a buyer agent anymore—either because they believe agents <strong>just open doors</strong>, or they think they can’t afford one.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246490 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Buyer-Agent-Problem-9-Need-to-Warn-Do-It-Yourselfers-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>It’s on you to set the record straight. Explain the 100 tasks you handle as a buyer agent and how, more often than not, sellers will cover your fee.</p>\n<p>And don’t forget to clue buyers in on the pitfalls of going it solo. Remember those sneaky unrepresented buyer fees we talked about? That’s just the <strong>tip of the iceberg</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Let’s say there are two identical offers on a house—one with a buyer agent, and one without. Guess which one has the edge? Yep, the one with the agent. Why? Listing agents know that deals with buyer agents are more likely to cross the finish line smoothly because they are experts in keeping deals on track after an offer is accepted.</p>\n<p>You know, tons of calls to inspectors, lenders, escrow officers, the listing agent, everything it takes to make sure all the parts are coming together.  It’s your job now to explain that.</p>\n<p>And while you’re at it, highlight how the continuous relationships agents have with one another often result in better outcomes and less risky deals for buyers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>The new NAR changes are definitely reshaping our industry, and how agents and their brokerages behave.

Buyers are signing because they want to get into the house. Buyers don’t know there is likely a cost to having no representation. That fee, negotiated between the listing agent and the seller, is hidden and it may be substantial. Buyers will often have worse outcomes, pay more and take on more risk, without a good buyer agent.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"do-home-buyers-need-to-sign-agreements-to-see-an-open-house\">Do home buyers need to sign agreements to see an open house?</h3>\n<p>No, but open houses do give listing agents an edge to get naive home buyers to sign agreements like dual agency (where allowed), unrepresented buyer, or a single property buyer (when the open house agent is not the listing agent). Home buyers need to interview agents to find the best one. They should never sign a contract on the fly as there may be hidden fees and it’s not in their best interest. Open house visitors can see the home without signing any agreement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if-a-buyer-requests-a-home-showing-through-zillow-must-they-sign-a-buyer-representation-agreement\">If a buyer requests a home showing through Zillow must they sign a buyer representation agreement?</h3>\n<p>Yes, in the form of a 7-day touring agreement. Problem &#8211; if the buyer wants to immediately make an offer, they are stuck with the randomly assigned agent who is paying Zillow to get these leads. That agent may easily not be the best match to get the best outcome for the buyer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-home-sellers-keep-paying-for-buyer-agents\">Will home sellers keep paying for buyer agents?</h3>\n<p>Yes, most likely. In the end, sellers just want the highest net price for their home. It’s simple math.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"if-a-home-buyer-signs-an-unrepresented-buyer-agreement-can-they-still-hire-a-buyer-agent\">If a home buyer signs an unrepresented buyer agreement, can they still hire a buyer agent?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but it may be costly because there is usually a hidden fee associated with these unrepresented buyer agreements and that fee may or may not end when the buyer decides they want their own buyer representation. Buyers can ask their agent to get the low down and work the issue with the listing agent for a potentially better client outcome.</p>\n",

This suggests challenges in achieving consistent profitability, which might raise concerns for agents seeking stable, long-term financial growth.</p>\n<p>Fathom Realty, on the other hand, is publicly listed under the ticker FATH, trading around $2. Similar to Real, Fathom has also experienced only 1 profitable quarter, indicating financial hurdles in maintaining steady profitability.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages face financial challenges, but Fathom Realty has a more transparent track record due to its longer tenure in the industry. In contrast, Real&#8217;s position as a newer player might imply potential for growth, albeit with some financial instability.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>Commission splits and associated fees are pivotal factors in deciding between brokerages. <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> offers a 100/0 commission split, which is appealing to agents seeking to maximize their earnings without sharing a portion with the brokerage. This structure, however, comes without any top agent bonuses. Fathom Realty operates with a production cap of $0, which is advantageous for agents who wish to retain most of their commission earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>Real</strong>, meanwhile, provides an 85/15 to 100/0 commission split, allowing agents to start with a modest commission share and gradually earn more as they cap. Real’s production cap is set at $12K, which could be appealing for agents who can quickly reach this cap and enjoy higher commission retention. Additionally, Real offers a $24K elite agent bonus, serving as an incentive for high-performing agents to maximize their income potential.</p>\n<p>When comparing commission splits in Real vs Fathom Realty, Fathom’s 100/0 split offers agents the maximum possible commission retention, but lacks additional bonuses. Real’s flexible split structure, combined with bonus opportunities, might attract agents looking for a balanced approach between initial commission sharing and eventual high earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>Beyond traditional commissions, income opportunities can significantly impact an agent’s earnings. <strong>Real</strong> provides multiple avenues for supplementary income, including revenue sharing and stock awards. Agents can earn 150 shares upon annual capping and have the option to purchase discounted stock with a 5% pre-cap bonus and a 20% post-cap bonus. These features offer substantial financial growth potential, especially for agents interested in building wealth through stock ownership.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> does not provide revenue share income or stock awards, focusing solely on commission earnings. This lack of additional income streams might limit financial opportunities for agents who prefer diversified earning potential beyond commissions.</p>\n<p>The analysis of income opportunities in Real vs Fathom Realty highlights Real’s edge in offering revenue sharing and stock awards, which could be appealing for agents seeking to expand their income sources. Fathom Realty’s straightforward commission structure may suit those who prioritize simplicity over-diversification.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Training and support are vital aspects of any brokerage, significantly influencing an agent’s professional development and success. <strong>Real</strong> offers 30+ live training hours per week, ensuring agents have access to continuous learning and skill enhancement opportunities. However, it does not provide a virtual office environment, which could limit access to collaborative tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, similar to Real, does not offer a virtual office setup or structured live training sessions. While Fathom emphasizes agent satisfaction and community support, its lack of comprehensive training programs might be a drawback for agents accustomed to regular educational offerings.</p>\n<p>In the comparison of training and support between Real vs Fathom Realty, Real edges out slightly with its provision of live training sessions, albeit without a virtual office. Fathom’s higher Glassdoor rating might indicate stronger cultural satisfaction and support, but both brokerages have room for improvement in their training offerings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-features\">Additional Features</h2>\n<p>Additional features such as healthcare options, mentorship programs, and technological tools can significantly enhance an agent’s experience at a brokerage. <strong>Real</strong> offers healthcare options, which can be crucial for agents seeking comprehensive benefits beyond financial compensation. However, it lacks mentorship programs and does not provide a free sponsor value or partner networks to the extent seen in other brokerages.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, in contrast, offers healthcare options but also lacks mentorship programs and additional technological tools. The absence of these features might be a drawback for agents seeking a full-service brokerage with comprehensive support systems.</p>\n<p>In evaluating additional features in Real vs Fathom Realty, both brokerages have specific strengths but also areas where they could enhance their offerings. Real’s healthcare options and stock purchase programs may attract agents looking for added benefits, while Fathom’s established reputation and agent-centric culture could appeal to those seeking community support.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-fathom-realty\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Fathom Realty</h2>\n<p>The choice between <strong><a href=\"https://www.onereal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.fathomrealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fathom Realty</a></strong> hinges on individual agent priorities and career aspirations. <strong>Real</strong> offers a balanced approach with flexible commission splits, revenue sharing, and stock awards, making it attractive to agents seeking diversified income opportunities and growth potential. Its innovative approach and extensive training programs cater to agents who value professional development and financial incentives.

Its established presence and agent-centric culture provide stability and support, which can be appealing for agents prioritizing simplicity and community engagement.</p>\n<p>In weighing the factors of <strong>Real vs Fathom Realty</strong>, agents should consider which brokerage aligns best with their financial goals, support needs, and overall career vision. Both brokerages offer unique advantages, and the decision ultimately rests on whether an agent values diversified income streams and training or prefers a no-commission-sharing approach with a strong community focus.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Century 21 vs Coldwell Banker to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-century-21-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Century 21 vs Coldwell Banker</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Century 21 offers agent/broker commission splits ranging from 70/30 to 92/8, with an 8% franchise/royalty fee even after the cap is reached. This means that agents at Century 21 can retain between 70% to 92% of their commissions but must pay an 8% fee on their gross commission income regardless of their production level. In contrast, Coldwell Banker provides splits starting at 55/45 and going up to 90/10, with a franchise/royalty fee ranging from 5% to 6.5%. Therefore, agents at Coldwell Banker can retain between 55% to 90% of their commissions, subject to the franchise fee on their gross commission income.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees also differ significantly between the two brokerages. Century 21&#8217;s monthly fees range from $0 to $350, reflecting differences in local markets and office operating costs. Coldwell Banker has monthly fees ranging from $150 to $179. Additionally, Century 21 includes transaction fees within their royalty fees, simplifying the cost structure for agents, whereas Coldwell Banker includes transaction fees in their royalty fees, which can be more predictable and manageable for agents. Errors &#038; Omissions insurance at Coldwell Banker costs $300 per month, while it is not specified for Century 21. These differences can impact an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning, making it important to consider each brokerage&#8217;s fee structure carefully.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Unfortunately, neither Century 21 nor Coldwell Banker offers revenue share programs, retirement income paths, or willable income paths. This limitation means that agents are primarily reliant on their commission-based earnings. In contrast to some other brokerages that offer multiple streams of income, such as revenue sharing or passive income opportunities, Century 21 and Coldwell Banker focus solely on commission income.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Both Century 21 and Coldwell Banker provide training programs, but the quality and availability of these programs can vary by office. Century 21 offers training that varies by office, which might lead to inconsistencies in the quality of training received. Coldwell Banker also provides training that varies by office, which can be a drawback for agents who prefer a more consistent training experience. Neither brokerage offers 24/7 support, which can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development. The absence of round-the-clock support means that agents might need to rely on local office resources or peer networks for assistance outside of regular business hours. This can be a limitation for agents who need immediate support or who work in markets with extended hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Both Century 21 and Coldwell Banker incorporate technological tools to enhance agent productivity and client engagement. Century 21 offers a range of technology solutions tailored to various market needs, including marketing tools and CRM systems designed to streamline agent workflows. Coldwell Banker also invests in technology, providing agents with tools to manage leads, market properties, and streamline transactions effectively. However, the specific technology offerings can vary by office, reflecting differences in local market needs and office resources. Both brokerages provide valuable technological resources, but the specific tools and platforms offered may appeal differently depending on the agent’s needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Century 21 has a Glassdoor rating of 4.2 stars based on 1.5K reviews, indicating strong agent approval and satisfaction. The positive rating reflects Century 21&#8217;s support for agents and the resources available to them. Coldwell Banker holds a slightly higher rating of 4.3 stars from 2.6K reviews, suggesting relatively higher agent satisfaction. The higher rating for Coldwell Banker may reflect its broader market reach, diverse training opportunities, and support resources. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-century-21-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Century 21 vs Coldwell Banker</h2>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.century21.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Century 21</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coldwellbankerhomes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coldwell Banker</a>, it’s evident that each brokerage has its strengths and weaknesses. Century 21 offers a strong brand, support for various market specialists, and a simplified cost structure with inclusive transaction fees. However, its fixed franchise fee even after the cap may not appeal to all agents, and the variability in training quality can be a drawback.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers a broader market reach, consistent support, and a higher overall agent satisfaction rating. However, the additional transaction fees and monthly fees can impact net income, and the variability in training quality across offices can be a concern. Both brokerages lack supplementary income opportunities such as revenue sharing, which might limit long-term financial growth for agents.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison and to find the best brokerage for your needs, check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.

Despite its short history, Real Broker has expanded significantly, operating in all 50 states with a growing network of over 20,000 agents. It boasts a Glassdoor rating of 4.5 from 109 reviews, reflecting a positive agent experience.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong>, established in 2021, is an even newer player but has also made rapid strides. Currently, LPT Realty operates in 24 states with over 11,000 agents and has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 from 37 reviews. While both brokerages are relatively young, Real Broker&#8217;s slightly longer presence and higher agent count might suggest a more established operational framework.</p>\n<p>In the comparison of <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, both brokerages show promising growth and positive agent feedback, with Real Broker having a slight edge in agent count and state coverage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"financial-strength\">Financial Strength</h2>\n<p>When evaluating financial strength in <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, profitability and financial stability are key considerations. Real Broker is publicly listed under the ticker REAL, trading around $6. It has experienced only 1 profitable quarter compared to 18 non-profitable ones, indicating challenges in maintaining steady financial performance.</p>\n<p>LPT Realty is not publicly listed, so detailed financial data is not readily available. This lack of transparency might concern agents looking for a clear understanding of their brokerage’s financial health.</p>\n<p>In comparing the financial strength of <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, Real Broker’s public listing offers transparency despite its financial struggles, whereas LPT Realty’s financial status remains somewhat opaque but might still offer competitive advantages through its rapid expansion and innovative business model.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>Commission splits and associated fees are pivotal factors in deciding between brokerages. <strong>Real Broker</strong> offers an 85/15 to 100/0 commission split with a $12K production cap, plus a $24K elite agent bonus. This structure allows agents to start with a modest commission share and gradually earn more as they cap, with additional financial incentives for high-performing agents.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> provides an 80/20 to 100/0 commission split with varied production caps of $15K under the Revenue Share Partner (RSP) model or $5K under the Business Builder (BB) model. LPT Realty also offers stock for top agent bonuses, adding another layer of financial incentive.</p>\n<p>In comparing commission splits in <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, both brokerages offer flexible split structures with potential high earnings for capping agents. However, Real Broker’s elite agent bonus and clear cap structure might appeal to agents looking for defined financial milestones, while LPT Realty’s dual cap options and stock awards provide varied paths to maximize earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>Beyond traditional commissions, income opportunities can significantly impact an agent’s earnings. <strong>Real Broker</strong> provides multiple income streams, including revenue sharing and stock awards. Agents can earn 150 shares for annual capping and have options for purchasing discounted stock, offering substantial financial growth potential.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> similarly offers revenue sharing and stock awards, with agents earning 75 (BB) or 150 (RSP) shares for their first sale and additional shares for subsequent sales. These features offer substantial financial growth potential, especially for agents interested in building wealth through stock ownership.</p>\n<p>The analysis of income opportunities in <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong> highlights that both brokerages provide diversified earning potential. Real Broker’s structured stock awards and discounted stock purchase options might appeal to agents looking for predictable financial incentives, while LPT Realty’s varied stock award structure offers flexibility and additional financial benefits.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Training and support are vital aspects of any brokerage, significantly influencing an agent’s professional development and success. <strong>Real Broker</strong> offers 30+ live training hours per week, providing agents with ample opportunities for professional growth and development.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong>, on the other hand, does not offer structured live training sessions but provides financial incentives through its commission splits and revenue sharing models.</p>\n<p>In the comparison of training and support between <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, Real Broker’s structured training programs offer a clear advantage for agents seeking regular educational opportunities. LPT Realty’s financial incentives might still attract self-driven agents who prioritize earning potential over formal training.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-features\">Additional Features</h2>\n<p>Additional features such as healthcare options, mentorship programs, and technological tools can significantly enhance an agent’s experience at a brokerage. <strong>Real Broker</strong> offers healthcare options and mentorship programs with a commission split of 50/50 to 70/30 for the first three sales, along with a virtual office environment.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> does not provide healthcare options or mentorship programs, focusing instead on its revenue sharing and stock award structures.</p>\n<p>In evaluating additional features in <strong>Real vs LPT Realty</strong>, Real Broker’s comprehensive support systems, including healthcare and mentorship, provide a more holistic agent experience. LPT Realty’s innovative financial models and stock awards offer significant financial incentives but lack additional support structures.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-lpt-realty\">Final Thoughts on Real vs LPT Realty</h2>\n<p>The choice between <strong><a href=\"https://www.onereal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.lpt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LPT Realty</a></strong> hinges on individual agent priorities and career aspirations. <strong>Real Broker</strong> offers a balanced approach with flexible commission splits, structured training, and comprehensive support systems, making it attractive to agents seeking a full-service brokerage with clear financial incentives.

Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Age Requirement</h3>\n<p>To be eligible for a real estate license in Oklahoma, you must be at least 18 years old. This age requirement ensures that applicants have reached the level of maturity and legal responsibility necessary for the profession.</p>\n<p>While you don’t need to be an Oklahoma resident to apply for a real estate license, you must have a valid Social Security number. This is essential for background checks and compliance with state regulations. Non-residents are held to the same standards as Oklahoma residents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background Check Requirements</h3>\n<p>In the real estate field, ethical behavior is vital. The Oklahoma Real Estate Commission will perform a thorough background check on all applicants. Any criminal history could result in the denial of your license application. However, being transparent about any past legal issues and demonstrating rehabilitation efforts can improve your chances of approval.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pre-licensing-education\">Pre-Licensing Education</h2>\n<p>In Oklahoma, prospective real estate agents must complete 90 hours of pre-licensing education. This course is designed to cover the essential topics needed to thoroughly prepare you for the licensing exam and your future career in real estate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What the Course Covers</h3>\n<p>The Oklahoma pre-licensing course includes in-depth instruction on various critical areas of real estate. This includes a focus on Real Estate Principles and Practices, Oklahoma Real Estate, Real Estate Finance, and other topics, providing you with the comprehensive knowledge needed for success in the profession.</p>\n<p>This portion of the course covers the foundational principles of real estate, including property rights, contracts, and land use. The course ensures you understand the role of a real estate agent and the dynamics of the Oklahoma real estate market.</p>\n<p>The course dives into Oklahoma-specific real estate laws, emphasizing the regulations that govern real estate transactions in the state. Topics include the Oklahoma Real Estate License Code and Rules, as well as federal laws like the Fair Housing Act.</p>\n<p>This segment of the course covers the basics of real estate finance, including mortgages, loan processing, and financial instruments used in real estate transactions. Understanding these concepts is crucial for guiding clients through the financial aspects of buying and selling property.</p>\n<p>The curriculum also includes other relevant topics such as real estate appraisal, closing procedures, and professional ethics, all tailored to meet Oklahoma’s requirements.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"choosing-a-real-estate-school\">Choosing a Real Estate School</h2>\n<p>Selecting the right real estate school is crucial. Look for accredited schools that offer flexibility, especially if you have a busy schedule. Online courses can provide the convenience of studying at your own pace.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Research Schools</h3>\n<p>Start by researching various real estate schools and reading reviews from past students. Look for schools with high pass rates for the real estate exam and positive feedback on their teaching methods.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Online vs In-Person Classes</h3>\n<p>Decide whether you prefer online or in-person classes. Online courses offer flexibility and convenience, allowing you to study at your own pace. In-person classes provide direct interaction with instructors and peers, which can enhance your learning experience.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evaluate Course Materials</h3>\n<p>Evaluate the course materials and support services provided by the school. High-quality textbooks, interactive lessons, and access to instructors for questions can significantly impact your success. Some schools also offer additional resources like exam prep courses and study groups.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Study Tips</h3>\n<p>Create a daily study schedule that covers all exam topics, ensuring regular review sessions. (<a href=\"https://asana.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Asana provides a great FREE task manager</a>)</p>\n<p>Utilize flashcards for key terms and concepts to enhance memorization.

Make sure all required fields are accurately completed.</p>\n<p><strong>Gather Required Documents:</strong> Collect necessary documents such as proof of your completed pre-licensing education, valid identification, and any additional forms required by OREC.</p>\n<p><strong>Submit Your Application:</strong> Submit your completed application and all required documents electronically through OREC’s online portal.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay the Application Fee: </strong>During the submission process, be sure to pay the required application fee, which is approximately $35 for the Sales Associate license.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Application Processing Time</h3>\n<p>The Oklahoma Real Estate Commission generally takes several weeks to process applications. During this period, they will review your educational credentials and verify that all requirements have been satisfied. To avoid any delays, double-check your application for accuracy before submission.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Track Your Application</h3>\n<p>You can monitor the status of your application online via the OREC website. Regularly checking your status will keep you updated on any additional steps or issues that may arise. If delays occur, contacting the Commission directly can help resolve any concerns.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pass-the-real-estate-exam\">Pass the Real Estate Exam</h2>\n<p>The Oklahoma Real Estate Exam is a comprehensive test that lasts 3 hours and consists of 120 multiple-choice questions. To pass, you need to achieve a score of at least 70%. If you do not pass on your first attempt, you will need to submit a new application and pay the exam fee of $61 for each attempt.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Property Ownership</strong>: 8%</li>\n<li><strong>Land Use Controls and Regulations</strong>: 5%</li>\n<li><strong>General Principles of Agency</strong>: 13%</li>\n<li><strong>Property Disclosure</strong>: 6%</li>\n<li><strong>Leasing and Property Management</strong>: 3%</li>\n<li><strong>Practice of Real Estate</strong>: 13%</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Valuation and Market Analysis</strong>: 7%</li>\n<li><strong>Financing</strong>: 10%</li>\n<li><strong>Contracts</strong>: 17%</li>\n<li><strong>Transfer of Title</strong>: 8%</li>\n<li><strong>Real Estate Calculations</strong>: 10%</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Laws and Rules Affecting Oklahoma Real Estate Practice</li>\n<li>Oklahoma Broker Relationships Act</li>\n<li>Property Management</li>\n<li>Disclosures and Hazards</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exam Preparation Tips</h3>\n<p>Go over the textbooks and notes from your pre-license courses.

Focus on areas where you feel less confident to ensure a well-rounded preparation.</p>\n<p>Take as many practice exams as possible. This helps you get familiar with the exam format and identify areas where you need more study. Practice exams can also help you manage your time effectively during the actual test.

Discussing topics with peers can enhance understanding and retention. Study groups provide a platform to share knowledge, ask questions, and support each other.</p>\n<p>Consider enrolling in an exam prep course for additional support and structured study. These courses often include practice exams, study guides, and expert instruction. Investing in a prep course can increase your chances of passing the exam on the first attempt.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exam Day Tips</h3>\n<p>Ensure you arrive at the exam center early to avoid any last-minute stress. Arriving early gives you time to settle in and focus before the exam begins.

Having all necessary documents ready can prevent any issues at the exam center.</p>\n<p>Read each question carefully and manage your time wisely. Staying calm and composed can help you think clearly and avoid mistakes. Take deep breaths and stay positive throughout the exam.</p>\n<p>Follow all instructions given by the exam proctors. Adhering to the rules ensures a smooth and fair testing experience for everyone. If you have any questions or issues, ask the proctors for assistance.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"complete-fingerprinting-background-check\">Complete Fingerprinting &#038; Background Check</h2>\n<p>After you pass the real estate exam, the next step is to complete the fingerprinting requirement as part of the mandatory criminal background check. This process is crucial to ensure you meet the integrity and honesty standards set by the Oklahoma Real Estate Commission.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scheduling Your Fingerprinting</h3>\n<p>Before scheduling your fingerprinting appointment, ensure you’ve received an email from OREC confirming that your application has been received and that you’re eligible for the background check.</p>\n<p>Once confirmed, schedule your fingerprinting appointment through any state-approved fingerprinting service provider. This may include authorized locations such as some UPS stores. It’s crucial to verify that the provider is recognized by OREC to avoid any processing issues.</p>\n<p>Attend your fingerprinting appointment at the selected location. Be sure to bring the required identification and confirmation documents as specified by the service provider.</p>\n<p>The fingerprinting process involves a fee, which is typically paid at the time of your appointment. Ensure you check the accepted payment methods and the exact fee with your chosen provider.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background Check Process</h3>\n<p>The Oklahoma Real Estate Commission (OREC) will conduct a background check using your fingerprints to verify that you meet the required ethical standards. This process is crucial in ensuring that all applicants adhere to the integrity and honesty expectations set by OREC. If any concerns are identified during this background check, you may need to provide additional documentation or take specific actions to resolve these issues before your license can be issued.</p>\n<p>If any issues are flagged during your background check, you may need to provide additional documentation or explanations. Being transparent about any past legal matters and supplying thorough documentation can help resolve concerns. If you have any doubts, consulting with legal counsel can provide guidance on navigating the process.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"submit-your-sales-associate-license-application\">Submit Your Sales Associate License Application</h2>\n<p>After completing the exam and fingerprinting requirements, the next crucial step is to submit your Sales Associate License Application to the Oklahoma Real Estate Commission (OREC) to confirm your eligibility.</p>\n<p>Fill out the Sales Associate License Application form available on the OREC website.

Today, we’ve got fantastic news! That is, it turns out there’s one overriding principle that can transform all your real estate agent marketing efforts into pure magic. Yay!</p>\n<p>In this blog, we’ll uncover this golden principle and show you how to seamlessly integrate it into your real estate marketing strategies. Ready for some marketing wizardry? Here’s your handy dandy index of what’s to follow:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#watch-the-you-tube-version\">The Golden Principle</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#shift-your-mindset-to-giving\">Shift Your Mindset to Giving?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#when-and-where-to-provide-value\">When &#038; Where to Provide Value?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#what-value-to-provide\">What Value to Provide?</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#value-primarily-for-home-buyers\">Value Primarily for Home Buyers?</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#value-primarily-for-home-sellers\">Value Primarily for Home Sellers?</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#value-for-both-home-buyers-and-home-sellers\">Value for Both Home Buyers and Home Sellers?</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-group-at-exp-realty-for-more-detailed-training-from-rock-star-producers\">Join our FREE Group at eXp Realty</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"watch-the-you-tube-version\"><span style=\"color: revert; font-weight: revert;\">The Golden Principle</span></h2>\n<p>Without further undue, let’s uncover this magical principle in real estate agent marketing. Ready? It’s super simple! It’s all about providing value to prospects and clients.</p>\n<p>Not just any value. It’s about offering free value—no strings attached. Make sure there’s not even a hint of expecting payment in return. You’ll provide just pure, helpful, no-strings-attached information. Give away what you’ve got for free, and watch prospects turn into paying clients.</p>\n<p>Why does this work? Because people don’t like real estate agent marketing sales tactics, pushy or not. And, they don’t care about your latest closing, how much GCI you racked up, or how much you protest that you’re an excellent, experienced agent.</p>\n<p>What prospects and clients do care about is real estate agent marketing which brings value to the table. So give them value upfront, and you’ll have prospects knocking at your door, eager to become your clients.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shift-your-mindset-to-giving\">Shift Your Mindset to Giving</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-244071\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Shift-Your-Mindset-to-Giving-1.webp\" alt=\"Real Estate Agent Marketing - Mindset puzzle piece highlighting the shift to a giving mindset\" width=\"1000\" height=\"275\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Shift-Your-Mindset-to-Giving-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Shift-Your-Mindset-to-Giving-1-300x83.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Shift-Your-Mindset-to-Giving-1-768x211.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Switching your mindset from real estate agent marketing which is all about sales to giving away real value instead. This is a total game-changer. It&#8217;s about genuinely helping your clients rather than just looking to close a deal.</p>\n<p>By offering insider tips, market insights, and valuable resources freely, you position yourself as a giver, not just a salesperson.</p>\n<p>This approach enhances your credibility and it also makes your interactions more satisfying and fulfilling. Prospects and clients appreciate agents who genuinely care and aren&#8217;t just after a quick buck.</p>\n<p>Embracing this value-driven mindset can turn one-time clients into lifelong fans who are eager to refer you to others, boosting your career sustainability. So, forget the selling! Adopt a mindset of giving real value, and watch your professional relationships, personal satisfaction, and deals grow.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-and-where-to-provide-value\">When &#038; Where to Provide Value</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-244070\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/When-Where-to-Provide-Value-1.webp\" alt=\"Real Estate Agent Marketing - Hands nurturing a small plant, representing providing value\" width=\"1000\" height=\"272\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/When-Where-to-Provide-Value-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/When-Where-to-Provide-Value-1-300x82.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/When-Where-to-Provide-Value-1-768x209.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p><strong>When:</strong> All the time!</p>\n<p><strong>Where</strong>: Everywhere you can.

This checklist helps clients stay organized during their move.</p>\n<p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A detailed list of tasks to be completed before, during, and after their move.

This list helps ensure a smooth transition.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find It:</strong> Moving companies’ websites, real estate blogs, and home improvement sites like<a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/c/ab/moving-checklist/9ba683603be9fa5395fab901e92cbf83\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Home Depot</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Provide It:</strong> Design an easy-to-follow checklist using tools like Canva or Google Docs.

crucial for a real estate agent&#8217;s career, influencing their financial success, professional growth, and overall job satisfaction. In this comparison, we will delve into the key aspects of <strong>LPT vs Fathom Realty</strong>, focusing on their foundation, financial strength, commission structures, income opportunities, training, support, and additional features.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#overview\">Overview</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#financial-strength\">Financial Strength</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#additional-features\">Additional Features</a></div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-fathom-realty\">Final Thoughts</a></div>\n<p><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></p>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> was founded in 2021, making it a relatively new player in the real estate industry. Despite its recent establishment, LPT Realty has made significant strides, currently operating in 24 states with over 11,000 agents. The brokerage has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 from 37 reviews, indicating a positive agent experience, though with a smaller sample size compared to older brokerages.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, established in 2010, boasts a more extensive presence, operating in 41 states with a network of over 11,000 agents. It enjoys a higher Glassdoor rating of 4.6 from 425 reviews, reflecting strong agent satisfaction and a supportive company culture developed over a longer period.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages have carved out distinct niches within the real estate sector, with LPT Realty focusing on rapid expansion and innovative approaches, while Fathom Realty emphasizes its extensive reach and agent-centric policies.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"financial-strength\">Financial Strength</h3>\n<p>When evaluating financial strength in <strong>LPT vs Fathom Realty</strong>, it is essential to consider profitability and financial stability. LPT Realty is not publicly listed, so detailed financial data is not readily available. This lack of transparency might be a concern for agents looking for a clear understanding of their brokerage’s financial health.</p>\n<p>Fathom Realty, on the other hand, is publicly listed under the ticker FATH, trading around $2. Similar to many newer brokerages, Fathom has experienced only 1 profitable quarter, indicating financial challenges in maintaining steady profitability.</p>\n<p>While LPT Realty’s financial status remains somewhat opaque, Fathom Realty’s publicly available financial records provide a clearer, albeit challenging, financial outlook. Agents might find Fathom’s transparency more reassuring, despite its profitability struggles.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Commission splits and associated fees are pivotal factors in deciding between brokerages. <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> offers a 100/0 commission split, which is appealing to agents seeking to maximize their earnings without sharing a portion with the brokerage. This structure, however, comes without any top agent bonuses. Fathom Realty operates with a production cap of $0, which is advantageous for agents who wish to retain most of their commission earnings.</p>\n<p><strong>LPT Realty</strong> provides an 80/20 to 100/0 commission split, allowing agents to start with a modest commission share and gradually earn more as they cap. LPT Realty’s production cap varies, with agents potentially capping at $15K under the Revenue Share Partner (RSP) model or at $5K under the Business Builder (BB) model. Additionally, LPT Realty offers stock for top agent bonuses, adding an incentive for high-performing agents to maximize their income potential.</p>\n<p>In comparing commission splits in LPT vs Fathom Realty, Fathom’s 100/0 split offers agents the maximum possible commission retention but lacks additional bonuses. LPT Realty’s flexible split structure, combined with bonus opportunities, might attract agents looking for a balanced approach between initial commission sharing and eventual high earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Beyond traditional commissions, income opportunities can significantly impact an agent’s earnings. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> provides multiple avenues for supplementary income, including revenue sharing and stock awards. Agents can earn 75 (BB) or 150 (RSP) shares for their first sale, and additional shares for subsequent sales. These features offer substantial financial growth potential, especially for agents interested in building wealth through stock ownership.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>Fathom Realty</strong> does not provide revenue share income or stock awards, focusing solely on commission earnings. This lack of additional income streams might limit financial opportunities for agents who prefer diversified earning potential beyond commissions.</p>\n<p>The analysis of income opportunities in LPT vs Fathom Realty highlights LPT Realty’s edge in offering revenue sharing and stock awards, which could be appealing for agents seeking to expand their income sources. Fathom Realty’s straightforward commission structure may suit those who prioritize simplicity over-diversification.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Training and support are vital aspects of any brokerage, significantly influencing an agent’s professional development and success. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> does not offer structured live training sessions or a virtual office environment. However, its commission splits and revenue-sharing models provide financial incentives for agents to perform well.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, similar to LPT Realty, does not offer a virtual office setup or structured live training sessions. While Fathom emphasizes agent satisfaction and community support, its lack of comprehensive training programs might be a drawback for agents accustomed to regular educational offerings.</p>\n<p>In the comparison of training and support between LPT vs Fathom Realty, both brokerages have room for improvement in their training offerings. Fathom’s higher Glassdoor rating might indicate stronger cultural satisfaction and support, but LPT Realty’s innovative financial models offer incentives for self-driven agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-features\">Additional Features</h3>\n<p>Additional features such as healthcare options, mentorship programs, and technological tools can significantly enhance an agent’s experience at a brokerage. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> does not provide healthcare options, mentorship programs, or extensive technological tools, focusing instead on its revenue sharing and stock award structures.</p>\n<p><strong>Fathom Realty</strong>, in contrast, offers healthcare options but also lacks mentorship programs and additional technological tools. The absence of these features might be a drawback for agents seeking a full-service brokerage with comprehensive support systems.</p>\n<p>In evaluating additional features in LPT vs Fathom Realty, both brokerages have specific strengths but also areas where they could enhance their offerings. LPT Realty’s revenue sharing and stock purchase programs may attract agents looking for added financial benefits, while Fathom’s established reputation and agent-centric culture could appeal to those seeking community support.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-fathom-realty\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Fathom Realty</h2>\n<p>The choice between <strong><a href=\"https://www.lpt.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LPT</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.fathomrealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fathom Realty</a></strong> hinges on individual agent priorities and career aspirations. <strong>LPT Realty</strong> offers a balanced approach with flexible commission splits, revenue sharing, and stock awards, making it attractive to agents seeking diversified income opportunities and growth potential. Its innovative approach and financial incentives cater to agents who value financial rewards and performance-based bonuses.

Its established presence and agent-centric culture provide stability and support, which can be appealing for agents prioritizing simplicity and community engagement.</p>\n<p>In weighing the factors of <strong>LPT vs Fathom Realty</strong>, agents should consider which brokerage aligns best with their financial goals, support needs, and overall career vision. Both brokerages offer unique advantages, and the decision ultimately rests on whether an agent values diversified income streams and financial incentives or prefers a no-commission-sharing approach with a strong community focus.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Not by accident. Not because it’s complicated. But because a whole bunch of YouTubers are out here slinging “facts” that aged worse than expired milk.</p>\n<p>Some of them mean well, but never updated their info after the last big brokerage shift. Others? They cherry-pick numbers to make their team look like a six-figure fairy tale, conveniently skipping over the fine print. And somehow, every revenue share video ends with a link to book a call&#8230; shocking.</p>\n<p>So if you’re wondering “how does revenue share work?” or trying to figure out if eXp revenue share is better than Real’s, or if KW’s “profit share” is even in the same sport, good news, we actually ran the numbers. Real math. Not vibes.</p>\n<p>This post strips out the sales fluff and makes every model easy to compare &#8211; apples to apples, not apples to ad copy.

(And Why Agents Should Actually Care)</h2>\n<p>If the phrase <em>“revenue share”</em> sounds like one of those corporate buzzwords designed to make bad compensation sound better, buckle up. Revenue sharing in real estate is actually where things get interesting, especially if you’ve ever recommended your brokerage to another agent.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Here’s the revenue share definition: it’s a model where brokerages pay agents a cut of the company’s commission revenue when they refer new agents. Not profit-revenue. That’s before the expenses, marketing costs, or whatever your broker&#8217;s dog’s spa bill is this month.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Revenue-Share-eXp-Page.webp\" alt=\"Revenue Share eXp Page\" class=\"wp-image-264889 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Revenue-Share-eXp-Page.webp 640w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Revenue-Share-eXp-Page-300x169.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>And the upside? Massive. For example, eXp Realty revenue share paid agents over $200 million in 2024 alone. Some agents earn passive income topping seven figures a year. Even if you’re not planning to build a massive downline, ignoring what revenue sharing means is like ignoring compound interest. It’s a regret that shows up on every agent’s “wish I started sooner” list.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-revenue-share-income-is-a-power-move-for-agents\">Why Revenue Share Income Is a Power Move for Agents</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk retirement plans &#8211; for people who don’t trust the stock market and don’t want to sell houses until their knees give out at an open house.</p>\n<p>Revenue share income is one of the only paths in real estate that can keep paying you <em>after</em> you stop working. Most revenue share models allow income to continue into retirement (and even after death) as long as you meet a few basic requirements. Spoiler: You won’t find that perk in your commission check.</p>\n<p>It’s not just money while you sleep. It’s income you can <em>will</em> to your family. And while brokerages all have slightly different rules (some easy to find, most buried like a secret menu item), the concept is the same &#8211; build it right, and this becomes your exit plan from real estate hustle culture.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-brokerages-benefit-from-revenue-share-models-hint-theyre-not-altruists\">How Brokerages Benefit from Revenue Share Models (Hint: They’re Not Altruists)</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 18%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>If you thought revenue-sharing companies created these models out of the kindness of their hearts&#8230; yeah, no.</p>\n<p>Here’s how the game really works: brokerages like eXp, LPT, Real, and Fathom figured out they could outsource agent recruiting to, well, agents. No more bloated ad budgets or ineffective recruiters. Instead, you bring people in, and they toss a slice of their revenue your way. Everyone wins &#8211; if agents are producing.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"175\" height=\"175\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Money-Bag-2.0.webp\" alt=\"money bag icon\" class=\"wp-image-241830 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Money-Bag-2.0.webp 175w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Money-Bag-2.0-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 175px) 100vw, 175px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>More importantly, revenue share aligns incentives. Recruiters don’t earn unless their recruits are closing deals. So, ideally, they <em>actually help</em> new agents get started. That’s the pitch. Whether it plays out that way? Depends entirely on the people and the brokerage culture. At eXp, for instance, strong revenue share support teams like Smart Agent Alliance make it more than just lip service.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-you-should-actually-care-about-in-a-revenue-share-model\">What You Should Actually Care About in a Revenue Share Model</h2>\n<p>Not all revenue share models are created equal &#8211; and no, your friend’s “I made $300 my first year!” testimonial doesn’t count as a reliable metric.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s what you really need to look at:</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-potential\">Income Potential</h3>\n<p>Each revenue-sharing company has its own puzzle of payout tiers, unlock requirements, and an available revenue share income pool from which to pay recruiting agents. Some brokerages give you a slice of the pie across seven layers of your downline. Others cut you off at five.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-sustainability-because-your-downline-wont-follow-you-twice\">Brokerage Sustainability: Because Your Downline Won’t Follow You Twice</h3>\n<p>Here’s the part most agents miss when chasing revenue share dreams: if your brokerage tanks, so does your passive income.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Dont-Forget-About-Deductibles.webp\" alt=\"Don’t Forget About Deductibles\" class=\"wp-image-266484 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Dont-Forget-About-Deductibles.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Dont-Forget-About-Deductibles-300x174.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Building a downline isn’t easy &#8211; you invest time, training, and trust. But if your brokerage changes the rules, slaps on new fees, or just plain folds, you’re stuck. And no, most of your agents won’t follow you to the next big thing. They’re not switching to your next brokerage just to keep your income stream alive.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>That’s why brokerage sustainability isn’t optional &#8211; it’s everything. You need a company that won’t buckle under market pressure or tweak its revenue share model every fiscal quarter.</p>\n<p>eXp Realty is the only public brokerage with five years of cumulative profitability. Add the #1 anonymous agent rating, and you’ve got a stable platform to build real, long-term revenue share income, not a house of cards disguised as opportunity.</p>\n<p>Pick wrong, and your exit plan turns into damage control. Pick right, and your downline keeps paying long after you stop selling.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"recruiting-differentiation-why-its-not-a-level-playing-field\">Recruiting Differentiation: Why It’s Not a Level Playing Field</h3>\n<p>At LPT Realty, Fathom, and Real, every agent gets the same pitch deck. That’s not hyperbole &#8211; it’s literally the same recruiting offer across the board. Your “value proposition” is whatever the brokerage already provides. So, unless you’re promising 1-on-1 hand-holding or late-night therapy sessions, it’s hard to stand out from the next recruiter down the hall.</p>\n<p>eXp Realty, on the other hand, lets agents get creative. You offer everything eXp brings to the table,e <em>plus</em> build your own revenue share value stack &#8211; custom training, tech tools, marketing systems, plug-and-play templates, full-blown agent attraction funnels.</p>\n<p>Better yet, at eXp, sponsors can team up. You can collaborate inside your downline, creating value that no single agent could pull off solo. That’s how teams like Smart Agent Alliance thrive &#8211; by stacking tools, training, and community into one irresistible recruiting engine.</p>\n<p>Bottom line? At eXp, you’re not locked into a cookie-cutter offer. You’re free to build something agents <em>actually</em> want to join and stay with.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-big-names-in-revenue-sharing-whos-in-this-breakdown\">The Big Names in Revenue Sharing: Who’s In This Breakdown?</h2>\n<p>Let’s break down the real contenders in the revenue-sharing arena &#8211; the brokerages that agents most often compare when deciding where to build a downline:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>eXp Realty – 7 tiers, 50% payout of company dollars, no fees, and no production requirement</li>\n<li>LPT Realty – 7 tiers, 50% payout, dual cap options, but delays rev share for 90 days</li>\n<li>Real Broker – 5 tiers, 60% payout of company dollar, but adds annual and percentage-based fees</li>\n<li>Fathom Realty – 5 tiers, 50% payout, lower caps, but has production requirements and fewer unlock paths</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You’ll notice we’re <em>not</em> fully including Keller Williams here. Why? Because KW doesn’t offer revenue share. It offers profit share, and that’s a very different animal.</p>\n<p>Profit share vs revenue share boils down to one key thing: timing. Revenue share pays before the brokerage takes out expenses. Profit share, like KW’s, only pays out after the bills are paid at the individual market center level.</p>\n<p>And the difference in income potential is dramatic. Example: an agent at KW with 55 people in their downline was making about $700/month in profit share. When they moved that same downline to eXp Realty, they started earning $12,000/month. Same effort, wildly different results.</p>\n<p>So, no offense to KW agents &#8211; but in this comparison, it’s just not a fair fight. For agents serious about building long-term, scalable revenue share income, the math knocks KW out of the ring before the first bell.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"comparing-revenue-sharing-tiers-7-tiers-vs-5-tiers-big-money-gap\">Comparing Revenue Sharing Tiers: 7 Tiers vs 5 Tiers = Big Money Gap</h2>\n<p>When it comes to revenue sharing, tier count matters &#8211; a lot. The more tiers a brokerage pays on, the more income you can earn as your downline grows.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it stacks up:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>eXp Realty: 7 tiers</li>\n<li>LPT Realty: 7 tiers</li>\n<li>Real Broker: 5 tiers</li>\n<li>Fathom Realty: 5 tiers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That may not seem like a big deal &#8211; until you do the math. If you sponsor 2 agents and each person brings in 2 more, a 7-tier model grows to 254 agents. A 5-tier model? Just 62. That’s over 400% more agents in your downline for the exact same effort.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 64%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Now, imagine sponsoring 30 agents who each bring in 2 more. That’s 3,810 agents in a 7-tier model vs. 930 in a 5-tier model. Spoiler alert: No 5-tier brokerage can compete with those numbers in long-term revenue share income, regardless of how they spin it.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"627\" height=\"411\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7-vs.-5-Revenue-Share-Tiers-of-of-Agents-if-Recruits-each-Recruit-2-Agents.webp\" alt=\"Comparison table showing a 7-tier revenue share system versus a 5-tier system, demonstrating that a 7-tier system generates over 400% more agents when each recruit brings in two agents.\" class=\"wp-image-269047 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7-vs.-5-Revenue-Share-Tiers-of-of-Agents-if-Recruits-each-Recruit-2-Agents.webp 627w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7-vs.-5-Revenue-Share-Tiers-of-of-Agents-if-Recruits-each-Recruit-2-Agents-300x197.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"comparing-what-it-takes-to-unlock-tiers\">Comparing What It Takes to Unlock Tiers</h2>\n<p>Every revenue share model makes you work a little before you unlock all those juicy downline tiers. That’s by design &#8211; nobody’s handing out seven-level payouts to someone who added their cousin and called it a day.</p>\n<p>Here’s the deal:</p>\n<p>All four brokerages &#8211; eXp, LPT, Real, and Fathom &#8211; require you to sponsor a certain number of producing agents to unlock deeper tiers of revenue sharing. “Producing” means they’re closing deals, not just parked in your downline.</p>\n<p>And yes, Fathom is a little different. It lets you count <em>any</em> agent, producing or not, toward unlocking those tiers. That sounds nice at first, but unless those agents are selling homes, your income isn’t going anywhere.</p>\n<p>Now here’s what most people don’t tell you: unlocking tiers isn’t instant. Your Tier 1 agents (the ones you directly sponsor) take time to bring in their own recruits. And while they’re growing their downlines, you’re still growing yours &#8211; recruiting more Tier 1s and helping them succeed.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 65%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Your downline grows outward <em>and</em> downward at the same time. So as more agents join, produce, and build their own teams, your overall system starts to fill out, and more tiers open up naturally.</p>\n<p>So don’t panic if you haven’t hit Tier 7 in six months. No one starts with a full pyramid and passive checks. But if you keep at it, those unlocks start triggering &#8211; and so does the income.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"598\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/of-Tier-1-Producing-Agents-Required-to-Earn-Revenue-Share-from-Lower-Tiers.webp\" alt=\"Chart comparing eXp Realty, LPT Realty, Fathom, and Real, showing the number of Tier 1 producing agents required to earn revenue share income from each tier.\" class=\"wp-image-269049 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/of-Tier-1-Producing-Agents-Required-to-Earn-Revenue-Share-from-Lower-Tiers.webp 598w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/of-Tier-1-Producing-Agents-Required-to-Earn-Revenue-Share-from-Lower-Tiers-300x190.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"comparing-what-brokerages-pay-at-each-tier\">Comparing What Brokerages Pay at Each Tier</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s talk about what you <em>actually</em> get paid in these revenue share models &#8211; because “up to” doesn’t pay the bills.</p>\n<p>Each brokerage has a different setup, but the concept is the same: they take what they earn from their commission split with agents, called the cap, and carve out a chunk of that to fund the available revenue share pool. That’s the pool of money used to pay agents for attracting and supporting their downlines.</p>\n<p>Now, how much of that pool each brokerage pays out &#8211; and how it’s divided among tiers &#8211; is where things start to vary.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>eXp Realty, LPT Realty, and Fathom Realty each commit to paying out 50% of the cap into the revenue share pool.</li>\n<li>Real Broker pays 60% of its cap, but it only spreads that across 5 tiers, not 7.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lets-break-that-down-with-a-real-example\">Let’s break that down with a real example:</h3>\n<p>At eXp Realty, agents have a $16,000 cap. Half of that &#8211; $8,000 &#8211; goes into the available revenue share pool per agent before they cap. That $8K is then split among up to 7 tiers of agents in your upline, depending on how many tiers you’ve unlocked.</p>\n<p>And just to complicate things, each brokerage pays different percentages at each tier. Some throw most of the money at Tier 1, while others spread it more evenly, or save the big cuts for deeper levels.</p>\n<p>To make things even messier, some brokerages advertise the maximum possible payout, others show minimum guaranteed, and a few blur the lines between a percentage of the agent’s commission and a percentage of the available pool.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:70% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"702\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Revenue-Share-Pool-Paid-for-Unlocked-Tiers.webp\" alt=\"Comparison table showing the percentage of the revenue share pool paid per tier for eXp Realty, LPT Realty, Fathom, and Real brokerages.\" class=\"wp-image-269051 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Revenue-Share-Pool-Paid-for-Unlocked-Tiers.webp 702w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Revenue-Share-Pool-Paid-for-Unlocked-Tiers-300x136.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>We ignored the spin and built this analysis on consistent assumptions. No cherry-picked numbers. No “maybe if” projections. Just a clear, side-by-side breakdown of what each tier pays, based on each brokerage’s real cap, tier structure, and available revenue share pool.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"extra-revenue-share-what-happens-when-theres-money-but-no-one-to-pay\">Extra Revenue Share: What Happens When There’s Money… But No One to Pay</h2>\n<p>Here’s a twist: a brokerage’s available revenue share pool can have more money than the minimum the brokerage agreed to pay out. Not because they’re feeling generous, but because there’s no one eligible to receive it.</p>\n<p>Let’s say an agent closes a deal. The brokerage earns its commission split &#8211; aka the cap &#8211; and sets aside half (or more) of that into the revenue share pool. That pool is supposed to be divided among eligible sponsors across the tiers. But what if:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Some of those tiers haven’t been unlocked yet?</li>\n<li>Some agents in the upline are inactive or didn’t meet production requirements?</li>\n<li>The agent didn’t name a sponsor at all?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you’ve got real money with nowhere to go. What happens to that unassigned extra money depends entirely on the brokerage. eXp redistributes that extra revenue share each month to Levels 1, 2, and 3, giving newer recruiters a real income boost. It’s not small change either &#8211; many agents see 20–50% more in those early tier payouts thanks to this policy.</p>\n<p>Important note: we didn’t factor this extra into any brokerage’s spreadsheet numbers, because it varies month to month. But if you’re comparing revenue sharing companies, ask them this: “What happens to unassigned revenue share funds?” Make sure they pass it through to recruiting agents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"differences-too-uncertain-to-calculate-but-too-important-to-ignore\">Differences Too Uncertain to Calculate (But Too Important to Ignore)</h2>\n<p>Even with all the math and spreadsheets in the world, some parts of revenue sharing just can’t be cleanly calculated &#8211; because they depend on unpredictable agent behavior, hidden fine print, or fluctuating rules.</p>\n<p>Here are the wild cards that could make or break your revenue share income, depending on the brokerage:</p>\n<p>eXp’s Fast Start Bonus<br />Agents can earn up to $4,000 per recruit (instead of $1400 + extra) based on their 1<sup>st</sup> year with eXp production. It’s a serious boost, but since we can’t know how many new agents will hit the benchmark, we didn’t include it in our revenue share calculator.</p>\n<p>LPT Realty’s 90-Day Delay<br />LPT doesn’t allow agents to earn revenue share income during their first 90 days. That’s a significant loss if you’re moving over a team or planning a fast start. So beware, this delay isn’t in our numbers, but it can undercut your early earnings.</p>\n<p>Production Requirements<br />Some revenue-sharing companies tack on ongoing requirements.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Fathom: You must close 1 deal every 6 months until you’ve got 12 recruits.</li>\n<li>Real: Requires agents to generate $450 in company dollars every 6 months to stay eligible.</li>\n<li>LPT: Requires $15,000 in production <em>or</em> revenue share earnings. Predictable so our calculations include it.</li>\n<li>eXp Realty: No production requirements or fees &#8211; earn from eXp revenue share whether you&#8217;re producing or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Real’s Revenue Share Fees<br />Real Broker charges $175/year plus 1.2% of all revenue share checks. These are predictable, so they’re factored into our model &#8211; but they still eat into your bottom line.</p>\n<p>Fathom’s Unlock Advantage<br />Fathom lets you count <em>non-producing</em> agents to unlock tiers. That could speed up your revenue share model progression… but if those agents aren’t closing deals, your payout is still $0.</p>\n<p>These factors vary so widely between agents and brokerages that they’re impossible to pin down universally. But just because some are hard to calculate doesn’t mean you should ignore them.</p>\n<p>They’re the hidden costs and bonus opportunities that separate a <em>great</em> revenue share opportunity from one that quietly drains your potential.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"caution-lpt-fathom-revenue-share-numbers-may-be-inflated\">Caution: LPT &#038; Fathom Revenue Share Numbers May Be Inflated</h2>\n<p>Here’s a big flashing warning label before you fall in love with the spreadsheet numbers: LPT Realty and Fathom Realty offer more than one agent cap option, which makes their available revenue share pool a moving target.</p>\n<p>To compare these brokerages with the others, we had to make assumptions about the available revenue share pool. We made generous ones.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>LPT Realty agents can choose a $5,000 or $15,000 cap. Since 50% of that cap funds the revenue share model, it means some agents are contributing just $2,500 to the pool, others up to $7,500. We assumed a 50/50 agent split and used the midpoint: $5,000 in the pool per agent. In reality, it’s likely lower – LPT likely attracts mostly agents who choose the resulting $2500 pool.</li>\n<li>Fathom Realty also has two cap options: $9,000 or $12,000, leaving either $4,500 or $6,000 in the revenue share pool. Again, we used the midpoint ($5,250) to keep comparisons fair, but real-world earnings might be significantly lower depending on what plan most agents choose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Long story short? The numbers for LPT and Fathom in our revenue share calculator are probably on the high side. We leaned toward optimism to give them the benefit of the doubt, but if anything, actual revenue share income from these brokerages may be much lower.</p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re comparing revenue sharing companies and see LPT or Fathom looking competitive on paper, remember: assumptions matter. And here, the assumptions lean in their favor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"potential-revenue-share-earnings-comparison-the-only-math-that-matters\">Potential Revenue Share Earnings Comparison: The Only Math That Matters</h2>\n<p>Okay, now that we’ve covered caps, tiers, unlocks, fine print, bonus policies, and fuzzy brokerage promises &#8211; let’s talk real earnings.</p>\n<p>This is the part every agent <em>thinks</em> they understand&#8230; until they realize how many variables actually move the needle. It’s not just about what a brokerage pays per level or how many tiers it has. It’s about how all those pieces work together in the real world.</p>\n<p>Our spreadsheet takes a conservative growth scenario:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You sponsor the stated number of agents (your Tier 1).</li>\n<li>Those agents each sponsor an average of two more agents.</li>\n<li>Your downline fills in tier by tier over time, naturally expanding as both you and your recruits keep building.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From there, we calculated:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How many agents land in each tier under each revenue share model (7-tier vs. 5-tier),</li>\n<li>How much each brokerage commits to the available revenue share pool, and</li>\n<li>The actual payout structure for every level. </li>\n<li>With Tier 1 agents of: 2,4,5,8,10,12,16,20,30 – opening difference tiers for at least 1 brokerage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To keep it visual (and to satisfy our inner spreadsheet nerd), we color-coded the results:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Dark Green = Best-earning brokerage for that agent count</li>\n<li>Red = Worst-earning brokerage for that agent count</li>\n<li>Light Green/Red = Second best/worst</li>\n<li>Yellow = Tiers that are unlocked based on how many producing Tier 1 agents you have.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last, to avoid bias, we show Tier 1 agent numbers below that changed the ranking order (from best to worst) of at least 1 brokerage. That avoids us choosing Tier 1 agent numbers merely to make eXp look better than others.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"739\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Detailed-Revenue-Share-Earnings-Comparison-eXp-Realty-LPT-Realty-Fathom-and-Real-1024x739.webp\" alt=\"Detailed spreadsheet comparing revenue share models, tier requirements, and potential earnings across eXp Realty, LPT Realty, Fathom, and Real, highlighting advantages, disadvantages, and net earnings scenarios.\" class=\"wp-image-269054\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Detailed-Revenue-Share-Earnings-Comparison-eXp-Realty-LPT-Realty-Fathom-and-Real-1024x739.webp 1024w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Detailed-Revenue-Share-Earnings-Comparison-eXp-Realty-LPT-Realty-Fathom-and-Real-300x217.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Detailed-Revenue-Share-Earnings-Comparison-eXp-Realty-LPT-Realty-Fathom-and-Real-768x554.webp 768w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Detailed-Revenue-Share-Earnings-Comparison-eXp-Realty-LPT-Realty-Fathom-and-Real-1536x1108.webp 1536w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Detailed-Revenue-Share-Earnings-Comparison-eXp-Realty-LPT-Realty-Fathom-and-Real-2048x1478.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n<p>We were obviously thrilled to see eXp Realty outperform the competition by a wide margin &#8211; no surprise there.

As noted above, that result hinged on a generous assumption: we calculated earnings as if half of LPT’s agents were enrolled in their higher-tier revenue share plan.</p>\n<p>Realistically, that’s a stretch. Most agents who switch to a 100% commission brokerage like LPT (especially with their lower agent support) are doing it to maximize take-home pay, not to opt into a split with better rev share potential. So, we decided to run the numbers again, this time assuming the worst-case scenario: every agent on the lower revenue share plan.</p>\n<p>Below we show the original calculation ($5000 for revshare pool) and the worst possibility ($2500 for revshare).
