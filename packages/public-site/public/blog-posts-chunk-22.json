This comprehensive guide will walk you through each essential step, ensuring you&#8217;re fully equipped to embark on your real estate career in Ohio. Let’s start your journey to becoming a licensed real estate agent in the Buckeye State.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Before diving into the specifics, it’s essential to understand the basic requirements for obtaining a real estate license in Ohio. These are the key criteria you need to meet:</p>\n<p>To apply for a real estate license in Ohio, applicants must be at least 18 years old. This age requirement ensures that candidates have the necessary maturity and legal responsibility to enter the profession.</p>\n<p>You do not need to be an Ohio resident to apply for a real estate license, but you must provide a valid Social Security number. This requirement is crucial for conducting background checks and adhering to state regulations. Non-residents must meet the same standards as Ohio residents.</p>\n<p>Integrity is vital in the real estate industry. The Ohio Division of Real Estate and Professional Licensing will perform a thorough background check. Any criminal convictions could result in the denial of your license. Being upfront about any past legal issues and providing evidence of rehabilitation can support your application.</p>\n<p>In Ohio, you are required to complete 120 hours of pre-licensing education. This course covers essential topics, including real estate principles, practices, and Ohio-specific laws, to thoroughly prepare you for the licensing exam and your future career.</p>\n<p>The Ohio pre-licensing course includes in-depth instruction on various critical areas of real estate. This includes a focus on civil rights laws, real estate finance, agency laws, and property transactions, providing you with the comprehensive knowledge needed for success in the profession.</p>\n<p>This section provides a comprehensive overview of the foundational principles and practices essential to real estate. It covers topics such as property rights, land use, real estate contracts, and the responsibilities of a real estate agent. The aim is to equip you with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in Ohio&#8217;s real estate market.</p>\n<p>In this segment, you&#8217;ll dive deep into Ohio-specific real estate laws, with an emphasis on civil rights, housing discrimination, and desegregation issues. The course covers key federal legislation like the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act, along with Ohio’s Civil Rights Act, ensuring you are well-versed in both federal and state regulations.</p>\n<p>This section focuses on the principles and methods of real estate appraisal. You&#8217;ll learn how to assess property values, understand market influences, and apply appraisal techniques. This knowledge is crucial for determining the value of residential and commercial properties in Ohio.</p>\n<p>This category covers the fundamentals of real estate finance, including mortgage types, loan processes, interest rates, and financial instruments used in real estate transactions. Understanding these financial aspects is key to helping clients navigate their buying or selling processes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Selecting the right real estate school is crucial. Look for accredited schools that offer flexibility, especially if you have a busy schedule. Online courses can provide the convenience of studying at your own pace.</p>\n<p>Start by researching various real estate schools and reading reviews from past students. Look for schools with high pass rates for the real estate exam and positive feedback on their teaching methods.</p>\n<p>Decide whether you prefer online or in-person classes. Online courses offer flexibility and convenience, allowing you to study at your own pace. In-person classes provide direct interaction with instructors and peers, which can enhance your learning experience.</p>\n<p>Evaluate the course materials and support services provided by the school. High-quality textbooks, interactive lessons, and access to instructors for questions can significantly impact your success. Some schools also offer additional resources like exam prep courses and study groups.</p>\n<p>Create a daily study schedule that covers all exam topics, ensuring regular review sessions.

During this period, they will review your educational transcripts and verify that you meet all necessary requirements.

To pass, you need to achieve a score of at least 70%. If you do not pass on your first attempt, you will need to submit a new application and pay the exam fee of $61 for each attempt.</p>\n<ul class=\"list_style_2\">\n<li>Ownership Rights</li>\n<li>Title Transfers</li>\n<li>Real Estate Contracts</li>\n<li>Leasing &#038; Management</li>\n<li>Real Estate Practices</li>\n<li>Property Disclosures</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"list_style_2\">\n<li>Land Use &#038; Zoning</li>\n<li>State Real Estate Oversight</li>\n<li>Licensing Rules</li>\n<li>Ohio Commission Regulations</li>\n<li>Brokerage &#038; Agency</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"list_style_2\">\n<li>Property Valuation</li>\n<li>Real Estate Financing</li>\n<li>Transaction Calculations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go over the textbooks and notes from your pre-license courses.

Focus on areas where you feel less confident to ensure a well-rounded preparation.</p>\n<p>Take as many practice exams as possible. This helps you get familiar with the exam format and identify areas where you need more study. Practice exams can also help you manage your time effectively during the actual test.

Discussing topics with peers can enhance understanding and retention. Study groups provide a platform to share knowledge, ask questions, and support each other.</p>\n<p>Consider enrolling in an exam prep course for additional support and structured study. These courses often include practice exams, study guides, and expert instruction. Investing in a prep course can increase your chances of passing the exam on the first attempt.</p>\n<p>Ensure you arrive at the exam center early to avoid any last-minute stress. Arriving early gives you time to settle in and focus before the exam begins. Check the location and travel time in advance to plan your journey.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need a valid photo ID to enter the exam. Make sure your ID is current and matches the name on your application. Having all necessary documents ready can prevent any issues at the exam center.</p>\n<p>Read each question carefully and manage your time wisely. Staying calm and composed can help you think clearly and avoid mistakes. Take deep breaths and stay positive throughout the exam.</p>\n<p>Follow all instructions given by the exam proctors. Adhering to the rules ensures a smooth and fair testing experience for everyone. If you have any questions or issues, ask the proctors for assistance.</p>\n<p>After passing the exam, you must complete the fingerprinting requirement as part of your background check. This step is crucial to verify that you meet the honesty and integrity standards set by the Ohio Division of Real Estate and Professional Licensing.</p>\n<p>Locate a Live Scan service provider approved by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI). Live Scan is a secure and efficient electronic fingerprinting process. Schedule an appointment with a nearby provider (Costs typically range from $30 to $60).</p>\n<p>Fill out and submit the necessary forms along with the fingerprinting fee. The Live Scan service provider will electronically transmit your fingerprints to the BCI. Be sure to keep a copy of the form and your payment receipt for your records.</p>\n<p>The fingerprinting fee varies depending on the provider. This fee generally includes both the Live Scan service and the background check. Confirm the total cost when scheduling your appointment.</p>\n<p>The Ohio Division of Real Estate and Professional Licensing will conduct a background check using your fingerprints to ensure you meet the required ethical standards. Any concerns identified during this check may need to be resolved before your license can be issued.</p>\n<p>If any issues arise during the background check, you may need to provide additional documentation or explanations. Being transparent about your past and taking responsibility can positively impact the Division’s decision. Consider seeking legal advice if any complex issues arise.</p>\n<p>The next step is to submit your Salesperson License Application to confirm that you have passed the exam and completed the fingerprinting requirement.</p>\n<p>Fill out the Salesperson License Application form available on the Ohio Division of Real Estate and Professional Licensing website. Make sure all sections are accurately completed. The form can be <span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><a href=\"https://com.ohio.gov/divisions-and-programs/real-estate-and-professional-licensing/real-estate-and-professional-licensing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #00ccff;\">accessed and submitted online</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Include proof that you passed the Ohio real estate exam. This documentation is crucial for the Division to verify your eligibility. Keep a copy of your exam results for your personal records.</p>\n<p>Attach your Live Scan Service form as proof that you have fulfilled the fingerprinting requirement. Ensure all required signatures and information are correctly provided.</p>\n<p>As of 2024, the fee for the Salesperson License in Ohio is $81. This fee must be submitted along with your application. Keep a copy of your payment receipt for future reference.</p>\n<p>After submitting your application, you can track its status online through the Ohio Division of Real Estate and Professional Licensing website. Regularly checking the status will keep you updated on any progress or additional requirements. If there are delays, contacting the Division directly can provide clarity and help expedite the process. </p>\n<p>Once you pass the exam, you need to find a sponsoring broker to activate your license. Look for a brokerage that aligns with your goals and offers the support you need.</p>\n<p>Find a supportive and collaborative environment. The right culture can significantly impact your job satisfaction and success.</p>\n<p>Understand the financial arrangements. Different brokerages offer different commission splits, so choose one that suits your financial goals.</p>\n<p>Choose a broker who provides ample training and mentorship opportunities.

    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Compass vs The Agency to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<p><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-compass-vs-the-agency\">Final Thoughts on Compass vs The Agency</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<div style=\"height: 12px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Compass offers splits ranging from 60/40 to 92.5/7.5, with no franchise/royalty fee, and agents sometimes have a cap. The Agency provides splits starting at 70/30 and going up to 90/10, with a 6% franchise/royalty fee, and no cap.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees also differ significantly. Compass charges $145, varying by office, whereas The Agency’s monthly fees also vary by office. Additionally, Compass charges a transaction fee of up to 4%, while The Agency includes transaction fees within their royalty fees. These differences can impact an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning, making it important to consider each brokerage&#8217;s fee structure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Unfortunately, neither Compass nor The Agency offers revenue share programs, retirement income paths, or willable income paths, limiting agents primarily to their commission-based earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Compass offers training through Compass Academy, providing structured learning opportunities. In contrast, The Agency provides training that varies by office, which might lead to inconsistencies in the quality of training received. Neither brokerage offers 24/7 support, which can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Compass is recognized for its technological advancements and robust tools, which are available through Compass Academy. The Agency also incorporates technological tools, but its offerings vary by office. Both brokerages provide valuable technological resources, but the specific tools and platforms offered may appeal differently depending on the agent’s needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Compass has a Glassdoor rating of 3.7 stars based on 2.4K reviews, indicating areas needing improvement. The Agency holds a slightly higher rating of 4.1 stars from 72 reviews, suggesting relatively higher agent satisfaction. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-compass-vs-the-agency\">Final Thoughts on Compass vs The Agency</h2>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Compass</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theagencyre.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Agency</a>, it’s evident that each brokerage has its strengths and weaknesses. The Agency offers a more traditional structure with consistent fee inclusions, making it a stable choice for many agents.

    "content": "<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Get a real estate license in Michigan</h1>\n<p>Starting your real estate career in Michigan might seem challenging, but with the right guidance, it’s a clear and manageable process. This detailed guide will take you through each necessary step, ensuring you’re fully prepared to launch your real estate career in Michigan. Let’s begin your journey to becoming a licensed real estate agent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Before getting into the specifics, it&#8217;s crucial to grasp the basic requirements for obtaining a real estate license in Michigan. These are the essential criteria you need to meet:</p>\n<p>To apply for a real estate license in Michigan, applicants must be at least 18 years old. This ensures that individuals have reached the required level of maturity and legal responsibility needed for the profession.</p>\n<p>You do not need to be a Michigan resident to apply for a real estate license, but you must provide a valid Social Security number. This is essential for conducting background checks and ensuring compliance with state regulations. Non-residents must meet the same standards as Michigan residents.</p>\n<p>Integrity is critical in the real estate profession. The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) will conduct a comprehensive background check. Any criminal convictions could lead to the denial of your license. Being transparent about any past legal issues and showing evidence of rehabilitation can strengthen your application.</p>\n<p>In Michigan, you must complete 40 hours of pre-licensing education. This course covers crucial topics such as real estate principles, practices, and Michigan-specific laws.</p>\n<p>The required course to get your Michigan license includes 4 hours on federal and state civil rights laws, ensuring comprehensive legal knowledge. Additionally, 36 hours cover essential real estate topics like finance, agency laws, and property transactions, preparing you for all aspects of the profession.</p>\n<p>This category fulfills the state-mandated requirement by dividing the 4 hours evenly between federal and Michigan-specific civil rights laws. The federal portion covers major laws like the Civil Rights Acts, Fair Housing Act, and Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as well as issues like redlining and steering. The Michigan portion addresses state-specific laws such as the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, the Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act, and details on filing Fair Housing complaints.</p>\n<p>This category comprises 36 hours of instruction across 16 levels, covering essential real estate topics. These include foundational knowledge of real estate, principles of finance, agency laws, property condition disclosures, purchase contracts, and the processes of closing and escrow. Each level varies in length depending on the complexity of the subject.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Selecting the right real estate school is crucial. Look for accredited schools that offer flexibility, especially if you have a busy schedule. Online courses can provide the convenience of studying at your own pace.</p>\n<p>Start by researching various real estate schools and reading reviews from past students. Look for schools with high pass rates for the real estate exam and positive feedback on their teaching methods.</p>\n<p>Decide whether you prefer online or in-person classes. Online courses offer flexibility and convenience, allowing you to study at your own pace. In-person classes provide direct interaction with instructors and peers, which can enhance your learning experience.</p>\n<p>Evaluate the course materials and support services provided by the school. High-quality textbooks, interactive lessons, and access to instructors for questions can significantly impact your success. Some schools also offer additional resources like exam prep courses and study groups.</p>\n<p>Create a daily study schedule that covers all exam topics, ensuring regular review sessions. (<span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><a href=\"https://asana.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #00ccff;\">Asana provides a great FREE task manager</a></span>)</p>\n<p>Utilize flashcards for key terms and concepts to enhance memorization.

During this time, they will review your transcripts and verify that you meet all the requirements. Make sure to double-check your application for completeness to avoid any delays.</p>\n<p>You can track the status of your application online through the DBPR’s website. Regularly checking the status can help you stay informed about any issues or additional requirements. If there are delays, contacting the DBPR directly can provide clarity and expedite the process.</p>\n<p>The exam is a 3.5-hour test with 100 multiple-choice questions. You need to score at least 75% to pass. Each attempt requires a new application and a fee of $37.</p>\n<ul class=\"list_style_2\">\n<li>Ownership of Property</li>\n<li>Regulations and Land Use Controls</li>\n<li>Market Analysis and Valuation</li>\n<li>Real Estate Financing</li>\n<li>Principles of Agency</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"list_style_2\">\n<li>Property Conditions and Required Disclosures</li>\n<li>Contractual Agreements</li>\n<li>Title Transfer Procedures</li>\n<li>Real Estate Mathematical Calculations</li>\n<li>Specialized Areas of Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"list_style_2\">\n<li>Property Conditions and Required Disclosures</li>\n<li>Contractual Agreements</li>\n<li>Title Transfer Procedures</li>\n<li>Real Estate Mathematical Calculations</li>\n<li>Specialized Areas of Practice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go over the textbooks and notes from your pre-license courses. Revisiting these materials can reinforce your understanding of key concepts. Focus on areas where you feel less confident to ensure a well-rounded preparation.</p>\n<p>Take as many practice exams as possible. This helps you get familiar with the exam format and identify areas where you need more study. Practice exams can also help you manage your time effectively during the actual test. (<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a href=\"https://realestateexamninja.com/michigan-real-estate-practice-exam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Free Michigan Real Estate Practice Exam</a></span>)</p>\n<p>Join or form study groups. Discussing topics with peers can enhance understanding and retention. Study groups provide a platform to share knowledge, ask questions, and support each other.</p>\n<p>Consider enrolling in an exam prep course for additional support and structured study. These courses often include practice exams, study guides, and expert instruction. Investing in a prep course can increase your chances of passing the exam on the first attempt.</p>\n<p>Ensure you arrive at the exam center early to avoid any last-minute stress. Arriving early gives you time to settle in and focus before the exam begins. Check the location and travel time in advance to plan your journey.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need a valid photo ID to enter the exam. Make sure your ID is current and matches the name on your application. Having all necessary documents ready can prevent any issues at the exam center.</p>\n<p>Read each question carefully and manage your time wisely. Staying calm and composed can help you think clearly and avoid mistakes. Take deep breaths and stay positive throughout the exam.</p>\n<p>Follow all instructions given by the exam proctors. Adhering to the rules ensures a smooth and fair testing experience for everyone. If you have any questions or issues, ask the proctors for assistance.</p>\n<p>After passing the exam, you must fulfill the fingerprinting requirement for a background check. This is a mandatory step to ensure you meet the honesty and integrity standards set by the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA).</p>\n<p>Use a Live Scan service provider approved by the Michigan State Police (MSP). Live Scan is an electronic fingerprinting process that is quick and secure. Locate a service provider near you and schedule an appointment (Costs typically range from $10 to $77).</p>\n<p>Fill out and submit the required form along with the fingerprinting fee. The Live Scan service provider will electronically transmit your fingerprints to the MSP. Keep a copy of the form and receipt for your records.</p>\n<p>Be prepared to pay the fingerprinting fee, which varies by provider. The fee generally includes the cost of the Live Scan service and the background check. Confirm the total cost when scheduling your appointment.</p>\n<p>LARA will conduct a background check using your fingerprints. This check ensures you meet the honesty and integrity standards necessary for a real estate license in Michigan. Any issues identified during the background check may need to be addressed before your license is granted.</p>\n<p>If any issues arise during the background check, you may need to provide additional documentation or explanations. Demonstrating honesty and taking responsibility for past actions can positively influence LARA&#8217;s decision. If necessary, seek legal advice to navigate any complex issues.</p>\n<p>The next step is to submit your Salesperson License Application to confirm that you have passed the exam and completed the fingerprinting requirement.</p>\n<p>Fill out the Salesperson License Application form available on the LARA website. Ensure all sections are accurately completed. You can <span style=\"color: #00ccff;\"><a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/lara/learn-about/license-permits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"color: #00ccff;\">access the form online</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Include proof that you passed the Michigan real estate exam. This documentation is essential for LARA to verify your eligibility. Keep a copy of your exam results for your records.</p>\n<p>Attach your Live Scan Service form as proof that you have completed the fingerprinting requirement. Ensure all required signatures and details are included.</p>\n<p>As of 2024, the fee for the Salesperson License in Michigan is $88. This fee must be submitted along with your application. Keep a copy of your payment receipt for future reference.</p>\n<p>After submitting your application, you can track its status online through the LARA website. Regularly checking the status will keep you informed about any updates or additional requirements. If there are delays, contacting LARA directly can provide clarity and expedite the process.</p>\n<p>Once you pass the exam, you need to find a sponsoring broker to activate your license. Look for a brokerage that aligns with your goals and offers the support you need.</p>\n<p>Find a supportive and collaborative environment. The right culture can significantly impact your job satisfaction and success.</p>\n<p>Understand the financial arrangements. Different brokerages offer different commission splits, so choose one that suits your financial goals.</p>\n<p>Choose a broker who provides ample training and mentorship opportunities. Early career support is crucial for your development and success.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/brokerage-interview-questions/\">17 Brokerage Interview Questions</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What training programs do you offer for new agents?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>How does your commission split work, and are there any additional fees?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>What kind of support and resources will I have access to?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Can you provide references from other agents in your brokerage?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choosing the right broker is crucial as it impacts your early career significantly.

For example, initial expenses may include:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-Licensing Course: <span>$100-$300+</span></li>\n<li>Exam Fee: <span>$79</span> per attempt</li>\n<li>Application Fee: <span>$88</span></li>\n<li>Fingerprinting Fee: Roughly <span>$10–$77</span></li>\n<li>Marketing Materials: Business cards, signage, and online advertising costs</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When you join a brokerage in Michigan,</strong> many will require you to become a member of the National, State, and Local Associations of Realtors. You&#8217;ll also need to budget for fees related to the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and Supra Key services.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>National Association of Realtors (NAR):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Membership Fees: For 2024, the annual dues for NAR are $156, plus a $45 special assessment fee for the Consumer Advertising Campaign, bringing the total to $201 per year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Michigan Realtors (State Association):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Membership Fees: The annual dues for Michigan Realtors in 2024 are approximately $183. This fee is separate from the NAR dues.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Local Association of Realtors:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Membership Fees: Local association fees in Michigan can vary depending on the specific association. For example:</li>\n<li>Greater Metropolitan Association of Realtors (GMAR): The annual dues are typically around $240 to $300.</li>\n<li>Ann Arbor Area Board of Realtors (AAABoR): The fees usually range from $225 to $275 per year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple Listing Service (MLS):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees: MLS fees in Michigan also vary depending on the region. For instance:\n<ul>\n<li>Realcomp MLS, serving a large part of Michigan, charges approximately $396 annually.</li>\n<li>Other local MLS services in Michigan might have similar fee structures.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Supra Key Fees:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees: Supra Key services in Michigan typically include an initial setup fee, around $50, and a monthly service fee ranging from $20 to $25.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These fees are approximate and may vary slightly depending on your specific location and the associations or MLS you join. It&#8217;s always best to confirm the exact fees with the local associations or MLS for the most accurate and up-to-date information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create a Budget:</strong> Track your expenses and forecast your income. Plan for slower months to ensure financial stability.</li>\n<li><strong>Emergency Fund:</strong> Set aside an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses or slow periods in the market</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Commission Structure:</strong> Real estate agents typically earn commissions from sales. Understand how your brokerage’s commission structure works and how to manage irregular income streams. Commission splits can vary widely, typically ranging from 50/50 to 70/30 or higher, depending on the brokerage.</li>\n<li><strong>Tax Planning:</strong> As an independent contractor, it&#8217;s important to plan for taxes. Keep track of deductible expenses, make estimated tax payments, and maintain good record-keeping practices. Consulting with a tax professional can help ensure compliance and optimize your tax strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get a Michigan real estate license, you must be at least 18 years old, complete 40 hours of pre-licensing education, pass the Michigan real estate exam, submit fingerprints for a background check, and file your application with LARA along with the $88 fee.</p>\n<p>The cost to get a real estate license in Florida typically ranges from $377 to $544+. This includes the pre-licensing course ($200-$300), application fee ($88), background check fee (<span>$10-$77</span>), and exam fee ($79)</p>\n<p>It typically takes 3 to 6 months to get a real estate license in Michigan. This timeframe includes completing the 40-hour pre-licensing course, passing the exam, submitting fingerprints, and waiting for the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) to process your application.</p>\n<p>The pass rate for the Michigan real estate exam varies, but generally, it is around 58-64%, depending on the source and the exam preparation provider. For example, some providers report a pass rate of 64%, while others have lower rates for different portions of the exam.</p>\n<p>If you fail the Michigan real estate exam, you can retake it. You’ll need to reschedule the exam and pay the exam fee again. There is no limit to the number of times you can retake the exam, but it’s essential to review the areas where you struggled before attempting the test again.</p>\n<p>To renew your Michigan real estate license, complete 18 hours of continuing education, including 2 hours of legal updates each year.

    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Sotheby&#8217;s and Berkshire Hathaway to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-sothebys-vs-berkshire-hathaway\">Final Thoughts on Sotheby&#8217;s vs Berkshire Hathaway</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<div style=\"height: 13px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Sotheby&#8217;s offers agent/broker commission splits ranging from 70/30 to 90/10, with a 6% franchise/royalty fee. This means that agents at Sotheby&#8217;s can retain between 70% to 90% of their commissions, but must pay a 6% fee on their gross commission income. Berkshire Hathaway, on the other hand, provides splits starting at 60/40 and going up to 90/10, also with a 6% franchise/royalty fee. Therefore, agents at Berkshire Hathaway can retain between 60% to 90% of their commissions, subject to the same 6% fee on their gross commission income.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees also differ significantly between the two brokerages. Both Sotheby&#8217;s and Berkshire Hathaway have fees that vary by office location, reflecting differences in local markets and office operating costs. However, a notable difference lies in the treatment of transaction fees. Sotheby&#8217;s includes transaction fees within their royalty fees, simplifying the cost structure for agents. In contrast, Berkshire Hathaway charges between $295 and $625 per transaction, which can add up for agents with a high volume of transactions. These differences can impact an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning, making it important to consider each brokerage&#8217;s fee structure carefully.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Unfortunately, neither Sotheby&#8217;s nor Berkshire Hathaway offers revenue share programs, retirement income paths, or willable income paths. This limitation means that agents are primarily reliant on their commission-based earnings. In contrast to some other brokerages that offer multiple streams of income, such as revenue sharing or passive income opportunities, Sotheby&#8217;s and Berkshire Hathaway focus solely on commission income.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Both Sotheby&#8217;s and Berkshire Hathaway provide training programs, but the quality and availability of these programs can vary by office. Sotheby&#8217;s offers training that is tailored to the needs of luxury real estate markets, reflecting its brand positioning. This can be particularly valuable for agents who specialize in high-end properties. Berkshire Hathaway also provides training, but it varies by office, which might lead to inconsistencies in the quality of training received. The lack of standardized training across offices can be a drawback for agents who prefer a more consistent training experience.</p>\n<p>Neither brokerage offers 24/7 support, which can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development. The absence of round-the-clock support means that agents might need to rely on local office resources or peer networks for assistance outside of regular business hours. This can be a limitation for agents who need immediate support or who work in markets with extended hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Both Sotheby&#8217;s and Berkshire Hathaway incorporate technological tools to enhance agent productivity and client engagement. Sotheby&#8217;s offers a range of technology solutions tailored to the luxury market, including advanced marketing tools and CRM systems designed to meet the needs of high-net-worth clients. Berkshire Hathaway also invests in technology, providing agents with tools to streamline transactions, manage leads, and market properties effectively. However, the specific technology offerings can vary by office, reflecting differences in local market needs and office resources. Both brokerages provide valuable technological resources, but the specific tools and platforms offered may appeal differently depending on the agent’s needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Sotheby&#8217;s has a Glassdoor rating of 4.0 stars based on 501 reviews, indicating strong agent approval and satisfaction. The positive rating reflects Sotheby&#8217;s strong brand, support for luxury market specialists, and the resources available to agents. Berkshire Hathaway holds a slightly higher rating of 4.2 stars from 981 reviews, suggesting relatively higher agent satisfaction. The higher rating for Berkshire Hathaway may reflect its broader market reach, diverse training opportunities, and support resources. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-sothebys-vs-berkshire-hathaway\">Final Thoughts on Sotheby&#8217;s vs Berkshire Hathaway</h2>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sotheby&#8217;s</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhhs.com/join-us/start-a-career\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, it’s evident that each brokerage has its strengths and weaknesses. Sotheby&#8217;s offers a prestigious brand, strong support for luxury market specialists, and a simplified cost structure with inclusive transaction fees. However, its focus on the luxury market may not appeal to all agents, and the variability in training quality can be a drawback.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway offers a broader market reach, consistent support, and a higher overall agent satisfaction rating. However, the additional transaction fees can impact net income, and the variability in training quality across offices can be a concern. Both brokerages lack supplementary income opportunities such as revenue sharing, which might limit long-term financial growth for agents.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison and to find the best brokerage for your needs, check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.

    "content": "<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">How to Get a real estate license in Illinois</h1>\n<p>Embarking on the journey to obtain your Illinois real estate license might seem overwhelming, but with the proper guidance, it becomes a manageable process. This detailed guide will walk you through every step, ensuring you&#8217;re thoroughly prepared to launch your real estate career in Illinois. Let&#8217;s get started on your path to becoming a licensed real estate professional.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Before you start the process, it&#8217;s essential to understand the basic requirements for obtaining a real estate license in Illinois. Here’s what you need to know:</p>\n<p>To apply for a real estate license in Illinois, you must be at least 21 years old. However, individuals who are 18 years old can apply if they have the sponsorship of a managing broker. This ensures applicants have the maturity and legal responsibility necessary for the profession.</p>\n<p>You do not need to be an Illinois resident to obtain a license, but you must have a valid Social Security Number (SSN) or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). This identification is crucial for the required background checks and compliance with state regulations?.</p>\n<p>Integrity is key in the real estate profession. Illinois requires all applicants to undergo a fingerprint-based criminal background check to ensure public safety. Any past legal issues could affect your application, so transparency is critical.</p>\n<p>In Illinois, aspiring real estate brokers must complete 75 hours of pre-licensing education. This education is divided into two main courses that cover critical topics such as real estate principles, contracts, and Illinois-specific laws.</p>\n<p>This course provides a comprehensive foundation in real estate, covering essential concepts such as property ownership, land use controls, state regulations, and real estate transactions. Mastering these principles is crucial for anyone aiming to succeed in the Illinois real estate industry?.</p>\n<p>This course is interactive, often involving role-playing and case studies, to help students apply what they&#8217;ve learned in real-world scenarios. It focuses on practical skills needed to navigate real estate transactions effectively</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Selecting the right real estate school is crucial. Look for accredited schools that offer flexibility, especially if you have a busy schedule. Online courses can provide the convenience of studying at your own pace.</p>\n<p>Start by researching various real estate schools and reading reviews from past students. Look for schools with high pass rates for the real estate exam and positive feedback on their teaching methods.</p>\n<p>Decide whether you prefer online or in-person classes. Online courses offer flexibility and convenience, allowing you to study at your own pace. In-person classes provide direct interaction with instructors and peers, which can enhance your learning experience.</p>\n<p>Evaluate the course materials and support services provided by the school. High-quality textbooks, interactive lessons, and access to instructors for questions can significantly impact your success. Some schools also offer additional resources like exam prep courses and study groups.</p>\n<p>Create a daily study schedule that covers all exam topics, ensuring regular review sessions.

This fee covers the fingerprinting service and the background check. Ensure you verify the total cost when scheduling your appointment.</p>\n<p>The DBPR will conduct a background check using your fingerprints. This check ensures you meet the honesty and integrity standards required for a real estate license. Any issues identified during the background check may need to be addressed before your license is granted.</p>\n<p>If any issues arise during the background check, be prepared to provide additional documentation or explanations. Demonstrating honesty and taking responsibility for past actions can positively impact the DBPR&#8217;s decision.

The right culture can significantly impact your job satisfaction and success.</p>\n<p>Understand the financial arrangements.

Understanding these costs and planning accordingly will help you manage your finances effectively.</p>\n<p>All stated fees are subject to change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial Expenses:</strong> These include licensing fees, marketing expenses, office supplies, and technology tools needed to start your career. For example, initial expenses may include:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-Licensing Course: <span>$100-$500+</span></li>\n<li>Exam Fee: <span>$58</span> per attempt</li>\n<li>Application Fee: <span>$125</span></li>\n<li>Fingerprinting Fee: Roughly <span>$50-$75</span></li>\n<li>Marketing Materials: Business cards, signage, and online advertising costs</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When you join a brokerage in Illinois,</strong> many will require you to become a member of the National, State, and Local Associations of Realtors. Additionally, you&#8217;ll need to pay fees for the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and Supra Key services.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>National Association of Realtors (NAR):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Membership Fees: For 2024, the NAR annual dues are $156, plus a $45 special assessment fee for the Consumer Advertising Campaign, bringing the total to $201 per year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Illinois Realtors (State Association):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Membership Fees: The annual dues for Illinois Realtors in 2024 are approximately $180. This is in addition to the NAR dues.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Local Association of Realtors:\n<ul>\n<li>Membership Fees: Local association fees in Illinois vary depending on the specific association. For example:</li>\n<li>Chicago Association of Realtors (CAR): The annual dues are typically around $300 to $400.</li>\n<li>Mainstreet Organization of Realtors (MORe): The dues are generally in the range of $250 to $350 per year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple Listing Service (MLS):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees: MLS fees in Illinois also vary by region. For instance:\n<ul>\n<li>Midwest Real Estate Data (MRED) MLS<strong>,</strong> which serves a large portion of Illinois including Chicago, charges about $504 annually.</li>\n<li>Other local MLS services in Illinois might have slightly different fee structures.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Supra Key Fees:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees: Supra Key services in Illinois usually include an initial setup fee, around $50, and a monthly service fee ranging from $20 to $25.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These fees are approximate and can vary slightly depending on your exact location and the specific associations or MLS you join. It’s always advisable to verify the latest fees with the local associations or MLS for the most accurate and up-to-date information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create a Budget:</strong> Track your expenses and forecast your income. Plan for slower months to ensure financial stability.</li>\n<li><strong>Emergency Fund:</strong> Set aside an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses or slow periods in the market</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Commission Structure:</strong> Real estate agents typically earn commissions from sales. Understand how your brokerage’s commission structure works and how to manage irregular income streams. Commission splits can vary widely, typically ranging from 50/50 to 70/30 or higher, depending on the brokerage.</li>\n<li><strong>Tax Planning:</strong> As an independent contractor, it&#8217;s important to plan for taxes. Keep track of deductible expenses, make estimated tax payments, and maintain good record-keeping practices. Consulting with a tax professional can help ensure compliance and optimize your tax strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To get an Illinois real estate license, you must be at least 18 years old, complete 75 hours of pre-license coursework, pass the state licensing exam, and undergo a fingerprint-based background check .</p>\n<p>The cost to get a real estate license in Illinois typically ranges from $350 to $760+. This includes the pre-licensing course ($100-$500+), application fee ($125), background check fee ($50-$75), and exam fee ($58).</p>\n<p>It typically takes 3 to 4 months to get a real estate license in Illinois, depending on how quickly you complete the 75 hours of pre-licensing coursework and pass the state exam. Some students may complete the process faster, while others may take longer based on their schedule and availability of exam dates .</p>\n<p>The pass rate for the Illinois real estate exam is relatively low, with some reports indicating a pass rate of about 33.3%. To pass, candidates must score at least 75% on both the national and Illinois-specific portions of the exam.</p>\n<p>If you fail the Illinois real estate exam, you can retake the exam up to three more times, giving you a total of four attempts. If you fail only one portion of the exam (either the general or the Illinois-specific section), you only need to retake the failed portion. If you fail all four attempts, you will need to retake the pre-license coursework before attempting the exam again.</p>\n<p>To renew your Illinois real estate license, follow these steps:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Complete Continuing Education:</strong> Ensure you have completed the required continuing education (CE) hours before the renewal deadline.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Submit Your Renewal Application:</strong><span> Go to the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) online license renewal portal to submit your renewal application. You&#8217;ll need to confirm your completed CE and update any necessary personal information.</span></p>\n<p><strong>3. Pay the Renewal Fee:</strong><span> Submit the $200 renewal fee online through the IDFPR portal.</span></p>\n<p>You can begin the renewal process 2-3 months before your license expiration date .</p>\n",

    "excerpt": "This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Keller Williams vs Redfin to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing&hellip;",
    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Keller Williams vs Redfin to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-keller-williams-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on Keller Williams vs Redfin</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<div style=\"height: 12px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h2>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Keller Williams offers flexible splits ranging from 70/30 to 100/0, with a 6% franchise/royalty fee until the cap is reached. In contrast, Redfin provides splits starting at 30/70 (with a base salary) and going up to 75/25, with no franchise/royalty fee.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees also differ significantly. Keller Williams&#8217; fees vary by office, whereas Redfin has no monthly fees. Additionally, Keller Williams does not charge transaction fees, while Redfin also does not charge transaction fees. These differences can impact an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning, making it important to consider each brokerage&#8217;s fee structure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Keller Williams stands out by offering revenue share programs that provide a retirement and willable income path. These additional income streams can offer substantial long-term financial benefits and security. Conversely, Redfin does not offer such supplementary income opportunities, limiting agents primarily to their commission-based earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Keller Williams provides extensive training opportunities, though specific details on the extent of their offerings are not standardized across all offices. In contrast, Redfin offers four weeks of local training, which might be beneficial for hands-on learning. Neither brokerage offers 24/7 support, which can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Keller Williams is known for its robust technology platforms, offering tools that enhance productivity and client engagement. On the other hand, Redfin is also known for its technology-driven approach, providing agents with comprehensive tools and resources. Both brokerages provide valuable technological resources, but the specific tools and platforms offered may appeal differently depending on the agent’s needs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Keller Williams boasts a high Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars based on 7.9K reviews, indicating strong agent approval and satisfaction. Redfin holds a lower rating of 3.6 stars from 1.9K reviews, suggesting that there may be areas needing improvement. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-keller-williams-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on Keller Williams vs Redfin</h2>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.kw.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keller Williams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.redfin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Redfin</a>, it’s evident that each brokerage has its strengths and weaknesses. Keller Williams offers more favorable commission splits, extensive training, and additional income opportunities, making it a compelling choice for both new and experienced agents. The innovative technology and comprehensive support further enhance Keller Williams&#8217; appeal. Redfin, with its no-fee structure, agent salary option, and comprehensive local training, may attract agents looking for a cost-effective and hands-on learning environment.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison and to find the best brokerage for your needs, check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.</p>\n<p>When making your decision, consider your specific needs and career objectives.
