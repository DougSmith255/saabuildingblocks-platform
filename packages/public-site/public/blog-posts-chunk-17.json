    "content": "<p>This side-by-side comparison of Real Broker and Corcoran will help agents understand the differences between these two brokerages, including commission splits, income opportunities, and overall support. Each brokerage offers unique advantages depending on your professional goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-corcoran\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Corcoran</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides highly competitive commission splits ranging from 85/15 to 100/0, giving agents the flexibility to maximize their earnings. Additionally, there are no franchise or royalty fees at Real Broker, allowing agents to keep more of their income. The production cap at Real Broker is set at $12K, with an additional top agent bonus of $24K. The annual fee is $750, and transaction fees are $0 until the cap is reached, making Real Broker’s fee structure simple and transparent.</p>\n<p>Corcoran, on the other hand, offers lower commission splits, ranging from 50/50 to 70/30. Agents also have to pay a 6% franchise fee, which significantly impacts their take-home pay. Corcoran does not provide a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split commissions with the brokerage no matter how much they earn. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the royalty structure, though the absence of a cap makes it less appealing for high-producing agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker stands out with its revenue share program, offering agents the chance to earn passive income through recruitment. This provides an additional revenue stream beyond commissions, which is ideal for agents focused on building a team and generating long-term wealth. Real Broker also offers a retirement income path and willable income with time qualification, further solidifying its appeal to agents looking for financial security.</p>\n<p>Corcoran does not provide any revenue share, retirement income, or willable income options. Agents at Corcoran are limited to their commission-based income, which may restrict their long-term wealth-building capabilities compared to the opportunities available at Real Broker.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers 30+ live training sessions weekly and 24/7 agent support, providing agents with the tools and resources they need to succeed. Whether you&#8217;re new or experienced, having access to real-time assistance and continuous training is a significant advantage.</p>\n<p>Corcoran’s training also varies by office, and it does not offer 24/7 agent support. While the brokerage is known for its luxury clientele, the lack of consistent training and immediate support could be a drawback for agents who require a more hands-on approach.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker uses a cloud-based platform that provides agents with cutting-edge CRM systems, marketing tools, and transaction management systems. This modern technology infrastructure ensures agents can operate efficiently and maximize productivity.</p>\n<p>Corcoran’s technology is focused on high-end marketing, tailored to its luxury market. While it provides strong marketing resources, its technology infrastructure is more traditional and may not offer the same flexibility and modern tools as Real Broker’s platform.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker holds a 4.5-star rating on Glassdoor with 109 reviews, where agents frequently highlight the revenue share model, transparent fees, and strong support system as key benefits.</p>\n<p>Corcoran has a 4.4-star rating from 321 reviews. Agents appreciate the strong brand presence and luxury market access but often mention the impact of the 6% franchise fee and lack of additional income streams as drawbacks.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-corcoran\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Corcoran</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers a more modern and scalable approach to real estate with attractive commission splits, lower fees, and more income opportunities through its revenue share program. Agents seeking long-term growth and financial security will find Real Broker’s structure more appealing.</p>\n<p>Corcoran, on the other hand, may be a better fit for agents focused on the luxury market who value brand recognition over maximizing their earnings. However, the absence of additional income opportunities and a production cap may limit the appeal for agents seeking to grow their wealth over time.</p>\n<p>For more information, explore our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to get a clearer understanding of which brokerage is right for you.

    "slug": "fathom-vs-century-21",
    "excerpt": "If you're deciding between Fathom Realty and Century 21, you're essentially choosing between profitability and brand tradition. Fathom offers agents a lean, commission-first model with&hellip;",
    "content": "<p>If you&#8217;re deciding between Fathom Realty and Century 21, you&#8217;re essentially choosing between profitability and brand tradition. Fathom offers agents a lean, commission-first model with no royalty fees, while Century 21 trades on its decades of name recognition and structured systems—but with costs that can significantly cut into your income. Both models have their place, but the best choice depends on whether you value financial freedom or the perceived advantages of a legacy brand.</p>\n<p>This side-by-side comparison breaks down what each brokerage brings to the table when it comes to commission structures, income opportunities, training, tech, and agent satisfaction—so you can confidently choose what aligns best with your goals.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty gives agents full commission retention with its 100/0 model. Agents don’t pay franchise or royalty fees, and there’s no cap to reach or maintain. The only ongoing costs are a flat $700 annual fee and per-transaction charges ranging between $165 and $465. These costs don’t change based on production level, which makes the model both simple and predictable. For agents who close regularly, this can mean tens of thousands more kept per year.</p>\n<p>Century 21 takes a more traditional approach. Commission splits typically range between 70/30 and 92/8 depending on performance and office agreements. However, even after reaching a $22,500 cap, agents continue paying an 8% franchise fee—permanently. Monthly office fees vary by location and can range from zero to $350, and while transaction fees are often built into that structure, the ongoing franchise fee alone can add up fast and seriously reduce take-home earnings.</p>\n<p>Agents focused on long-term income retention typically lean toward Fathom’s flat-fee setup, while those who prioritize affiliation with a globally recognized brand often consider Century 21 despite the higher overhead.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty sticks to commission-only earnings. There’s no revenue share, retirement plan, or willable income pathway. While the 100% model helps agents maximize income on every deal, there are no built-in opportunities to scale earnings beyond personal production. For agents who are looking to sell, close, and collect without additional layers, this setup is straightforward—but limited.</p>\n<p>Century 21 doesn’t offer additional income streams either. There’s no formal revenue share system, equity opportunities, or retirement structure, and no financial benefit to recruiting other agents. Like Fathom, your income at Century 21 is tied entirely to what you close. The difference is that franchise fees eat into that commission every step of the way, reducing profitability without offering any passive upside.</p>\n<p>As agent expectations evolve, more professionals are seeking models that reward team-building, mentorship, and production with extra income layers—something neither Fathom nor Century 21 currently delivers.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty takes a low-intervention approach to agent development. There is no formal training system in place, and agents do not have access to 24/7 support. This hands-off model can work well for experienced agents with their own resources but poses a challenge for anyone looking for mentorship, team guidance, or transaction support.</p>\n<p>Century 21 offers a more structured—but inconsistent—training model. The quality and availability of training resources vary widely from office to office. Some locations offer strong mentorship and onboarding, while others provide only basic onboarding materials and outdated workshops. Like Fathom, there is no companywide 24/7 agent support, which can leave agents scrambling during fast-moving negotiations or weekend offers.</p>\n<p>For agents who already know how to navigate the real estate process, both models offer autonomy. But for those seeking accountability and growth through consistent training, the lack of reliable coaching and accessible support makes both brokerages feel limited.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty allows agents the freedom to use whichever tools work best for their business. The brokerage does not offer a proprietary CRM or integrated marketing platform, which gives agents flexibility—but also means they’re responsible for building and maintaining their tech stack from scratch. For seasoned agents with proven systems, this freedom is a plus. For newer agents, it can feel like being left to figure it all out alone.</p>\n<p>Century 21 does offer a suite of tech tools that includes CRM systems, marketing platforms, and brand-backed resources. However, like its training model, the strength of those tools depends on the office. Some locations provide excellent support and digital infrastructure, while others fall short, leaving agents with inconsistent access to the tools they need to scale.</p>\n<p>In both models, the burden of business-building still largely falls on the agent. The question is whether you prefer full control over your tech stack with Fathom—or a franchise model that might offer tools, but not always at the level you expect.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty maintains a 4.6 out of 5 rating on Glassdoor, with hundreds of agents praising its low-cost model and high level of autonomy. Many agents highlight the simplicity of the 100% commission structure as a major benefit, though some note that the lack of hands-on support or team-building opportunities can create a ceiling for those who want to scale or grow in a collaborative environment.</p>\n<p>Century 21 has a 4.2 rating, based on more than 1,500 reviews. Agents appreciate the brand recognition and enjoy the access to a wide referral network. But concerns often focus on the high franchise fees, the variation in office culture, and the uneven quality of training and technology. For some, the brand association alone isn’t enough to justify the ongoing financial and operational trade-offs.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages offer independence—but neither delivers the complete combination of scalability, income variety, and mentorship that today’s high-performing agents are actively seeking.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Century 21</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is ideal for experienced agents who are focused on maximizing take-home pay and minimizing overhead. If you don’t need training, support, or tech and want the simplest model possible, Fathom lets you keep more of what you earn—no strings attached.</p>\n<p>Century 21 appeals to agents who value legacy branding and want to benefit from an established referral network. But the ongoing 8% franchise fee and high caps can chip away at earnings fast, and inconsistent training and tools mean not every agent receives the same level of support.</p>\n<p>Neither model offers a revenue share, stock equity, or scalable passive income path. For agents looking to build more than just a solo sales career, that absence is becoming harder to overlook.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

The production cap is set at $12K, and agents have the potential to earn a top agent bonus of $24K. Monthly fees are affordable at $750 per year, and transaction fees are waived until the cap is reached, making Real Broker a cost-effective option for agents.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, on the other hand, has commission splits between 50/50 and 70/30, which are much lower than Real Broker’s top splits. Douglas Elliman also charges a 6% franchise/royalty fee, further reducing the agent’s overall earnings. Unlike Real Broker, there is no production cap, meaning agents continue to split their commissions with the brokerage indefinitely. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty structure, offering some predictability but at a higher cost.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker excels in income opportunities by offering a revenue share program, which allows agents to earn passive income by recruiting new agents. This revenue share, along with Real Broker&#8217;s retirement income path and willable income options, makes it a great option for agents focused on long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman does not offer additional income streams such as revenue sharing, retirement income, or willable income. Agents at Douglas Elliman rely solely on commission income, limiting their ability to build wealth beyond sales.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides robust training with 30+ live training sessions per week and 24/7 agent support, giving agents access to resources whenever they need them. This is an excellent option for agents who want continuous development and immediate support.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman’s training varies by office, meaning agents may experience inconsistencies in the quality of training offered. The brokerage does not provide 24/7 agent support, which could be a drawback for agents who need assistance outside of traditional working hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers modern, cloud-based technology tools designed to streamline the agent’s work, including CRM systems and marketing platforms. These tools provide flexibility and efficiency, helping agents manage their business from anywhere.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, while offering good branding and marketing resources for agents focused on high-end properties, may not offer the same level of tech-driven tools as Real Broker. The technology at Douglas Elliman is geared more toward luxury real estate marketing rather than the cloud-based efficiency provided by Real Broker.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker has a Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews, with agents praising the transparent fee structure and additional income opportunities. The support system and modern technology are also highly rated by agents.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman holds a 3.9-star rating from 638 reviews.

    "content": "<p>When comparing Fathom vs Coldwell Banker, agents will notice stark differences in commission structures, fees, and income opportunities, which can heavily influence their choice depending on career goals and financial priorities.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-realty-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs Coldwell Banker</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a 100/0 commission split, which means agents keep 100% of their commissions, with no franchise or royalty fees. There is no production cap, making it a straightforward model where agents pay an annual fee of $700 and transaction fees ranging from $150 to $250 per transaction. This makes Fathom a highly appealing option for agents who want to retain the bulk of their earnings without ongoing costs.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker, on the other hand, has commission splits starting at 55/45 and going up to 90/10, which means agents take home less compared to Fathom’s 100%. Additionally, Coldwell Banker charges a franchise/royalty fee of 5% to 6.5%, further reducing agents&#8217; earnings. Coldwell Banker does not have a production cap either, so agents continue to split commissions and pay royalty fees regardless of their earnings. Monthly fees at Coldwell Banker range from $150 to $179, and transaction fees are included in the royalty fee, which adds some predictability but at a higher cost.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty does not offer additional income streams such as revenue share, retirement income paths, or willable income options. Agents rely entirely on their commission-based income, which can be limiting for those looking to build passive income.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker similarly does not provide revenue share or retirement income opportunities, leaving agents to rely solely on commissions. Neither brokerage offers the ability to earn passive or residual income.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty provides no formal training or 24/7 agent support, which could be a limitation for newer agents or those who require more hands-on assistance. However, the low-cost model and full commission retention may appeal to experienced agents who are already established and require minimal support.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers training that varies by office, which can lead to inconsistencies in quality. There is no 24/7 agent support, meaning agents may need to rely on local office resources for assistance outside of standard working hours. However, Coldwell Banker’s established brand and broader network may offer some informal mentorship opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty uses a tech-driven platform that helps agents streamline their transactions and marketing. Although it may not have the extensive brand power of Coldwell Banker, Fathom’s use of technology helps agents manage their work more independently.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker provides agents with solid technology tools, including CRM and marketing resources, but the level of technology support varies by office. As a more traditional brokerage, Coldwell Banker may not offer the same modern, cloud-based solutions that Fathom’s model is built upon.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty boasts a 4.6-star Glassdoor rating from 425 reviews, where agents frequently praise the 100% commission model and the simplicity of the fee structure. However, some agents mention the lack of training and support as a potential downside.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker has a 4.3-star rating from 2.6K reviews. Agents appreciate the brand recognition and support in certain markets but express concerns about the high fees and lower commission splits compared to newer models like Fathom.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-realty-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs Coldwell Banker</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a great option for agents who want to maximize their commission with minimal fees. Its straightforward 100% commission model and low transaction fees make it appealing for independent, experienced agents. However, the lack of training and passive income opportunities may be a downside for agents who want more comprehensive support.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers brand prestige, but with higher fees, lower commission splits, and no additional income streams, it may not appeal to agents who prioritize income retention. However, agents who value the brand’s reputation and broad network might find Coldwell Banker a better fit.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

Real Broker also has a production cap of $12K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions. There’s also a top agent bonus of $24K, which adds to the financial incentive. Monthly fees are $750/year, and transaction fees are $0 until the cap is reached, making it a straightforward cost model for agents.</p>\n<p>The Agency offers commission splits between 70/30 and 90/10, similar to many traditional brokerages. However, they charge a 6% franchise/royalty fee, which impacts an agent’s overall earnings. Unlike Real Broker, The Agency does not have a production cap, meaning agents will always be splitting their commission with the brokerage, no matter how much they produce. Monthly fees at The Agency vary by office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty fee structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides agents with additional income opportunities through its revenue share program. Agents can earn passive income by recruiting others to join the brokerage, creating a secondary income stream. Real Broker also offers retirement income paths and willable income with time qualification, which are great options for agents looking to build long-term wealth.</p>\n<p>The Agency does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income, or willable income options. Agents working with The Agency are limited to commission-based earnings, which may not be as financially rewarding in the long term.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h4>\n<p>Real Broker offers more than 30 live training sessions each week, giving agents the resources they need to continuously grow. Additionally, Real Broker provides 24/7 agent support, ensuring that agents always have assistance when they need it, which is a major advantage for agents working outside of typical business hours.</p>\n<p>The Agency also provides training, but the availability and quality depend on the office location, making it less consistent. There is no 24/7 support at The Agency, which could be a disadvantage for agents needing immediate assistance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker’s modern, cloud-based platform offers a variety of tools, including CRM systems, marketing platforms, and transaction management systems. This technology helps agents streamline their work and operate efficiently.</p>\n<p>The Agency is known for its luxury branding and marketing resources, which are tailored toward high-end clientele. However, it lacks the advanced cloud-based systems that Real Broker provides. For agents focused on luxury markets, The Agency&#8217;s branding is an asset, but it may not match the modern tools offered by Real Broker.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker has a Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews, with agents praising the clear fee structure, support, and opportunities for revenue sharing.</p>\n<p>The Agency holds a Glassdoor rating of 4.1 stars from 72 reviews. While agents appreciate the brand’s luxury appeal, there are some concerns about the commission structure and lack of additional income opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-the-agency\">Final Thoughts on Real vs The Agency</h3>\n<p>Real Broker is the better choice for agents who prioritize maximizing earnings, leveraging passive income opportunities, and having access to modern technology. Its competitive commission structure, lower fees, and revenue share model make it an attractive option for agents who want to build a scalable, long-term career.</p>\n<p>The Agency is a good fit for agents who focus on luxury real estate and prefer working with a prestigious brand. However, the lack of a production cap, higher fees, and no additional income streams may limit its appeal for agents looking to grow financially.</p>\n<p>For more information, explore our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to get a clearer understanding of which brokerage is right for you.

    "content": "<p>Choosing between Fathom Realty and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices comes down to a core question: do you want brand prestige or maximum income retention? These brokerages operate from two entirely different philosophies. Fathom focuses on agent autonomy and a predictable fee structure, while Berkshire Hathaway leans on legacy branding and luxury market credibility—but with heavier costs. If you’re evaluating which model better supports your long-term growth and income goals, this breakdown lays out everything you need to know.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-berkshire-hathaway\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Berkshire Hathaway</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty makes commission splits simple. Agents keep 100% of their commission on every transaction, with no franchise fees or royalty deductions. There’s no production cap, so your income isn’t penalized no matter how much you sell. The only recurring costs are an annual $700 fee and flat-rate transaction fees that fall between $165 and $465 depending on your plan. It’s a low-overhead structure designed to give agents more control over their income with fewer surprises.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway uses a traditional commission split model, typically ranging from 60/40 to 90/10. However, every transaction includes a 6% franchise fee—even after the agent hits their cap, which is not common among modern brokerages. There’s no production cap here either, meaning agents continue paying split percentages and franchise fees indefinitely. Monthly fees and transaction charges vary by office, but it’s not uncommon to see costs that range from $295 to $625 per transaction, in addition to variable office dues.</p>\n<p>The difference is clear: Fathom prioritizes take-home income, while Berkshire Hathaway builds its cost structure around maintaining its luxury brand footprint.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty sticks to one lane when it comes to income: commission. There is no revenue share model, no stock incentives, and no retirement or willable income structure. Agents earn only what they sell, making it a straightforward but narrow model for those looking to scale beyond personal production.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway is equally limited in this regard. Despite its size and reputation, the brokerage offers no passive income opportunities. There’s no formal program to reward agents for building teams, attracting other agents, or contributing to company growth. Your earnings begin and end with closed transactions.</p>\n<p>For agents who are focused solely on commission, both models offer viable options. But for those who want to build long-term, scalable wealth, neither provides a structure to support that growth.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty takes a minimalist approach to training. There is no formal onboarding program, no company-wide education platform, and no access to 24/7 support. While this approach may appeal to experienced agents who don’t need external guidance, it can be a significant drawback for new agents or those who are navigating unfamiliar markets.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway does offer training, but the quality and availability vary by office. In some locations, agents receive strong mentorship and educational opportunities. In others, the resources are sparse or outdated. There’s no centralized, always-available support system, which makes it harder for agents to get the help they need during nights, weekends, or last-minute client emergencies.</p>\n<p>If you’re self-directed and don’t need much hand-holding, either brokerage may be sufficient. But if you&#8217;re seeking structured development and high-level coaching, neither model provides the level of ongoing support that agents now expect.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty provides cloud-based systems and core operational tools like a CRM and transaction management platform. The technology is modern, functional, and designed to help agents stay organized—but it’s not proprietary or focused on luxury presentation. Agents are encouraged to bring in or build their own tech stacks to suit their specific business model, making Fathom a flexible option for tech-savvy agents who know what tools they want.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway offers a more traditional suite of marketing and tech resources. These tools often focus on maintaining the brand’s luxury image—think branded listing materials, email templates, and marketing support that leans heavily into high-end aesthetics. While useful for agents working luxury listings, the tech is less about automation or innovation and more about reinforcing the company’s image. In many offices, the backend platforms are aging and may not integrate well with modern lead generation tools.</p>\n<p>Agents looking for tech flexibility and streamlined workflows often lean toward Fathom. Those prioritizing a brand-enhancing toolkit for high-end listings might prefer Berkshire Hathaway—though it comes with a cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty boasts a 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor, with agents often praising the fee structure, commission model, and freedom to build their business independently. Many reviews describe Fathom as the ideal environment for experienced agents who want to stop splitting their hard-earned commission. However, the lack of support, training, and passive income potential is a common point of concern among those looking to grow or scale.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway holds a 4.2-star rating based on nearly 1,000 reviews. Agents frequently express pride in representing a household brand, especially in the luxury segment. However, some reviews also highlight frustration with ongoing franchise fees, lower splits, and inconsistent office leadership. The prestige is real—but it often comes at the expense of profitability and growth flexibility.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, agent satisfaction at both brokerages comes down to what agents value most: income retention or brand prestige.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-berkshire-hathaway\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Berkshire Hathaway</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is the better fit for agents who want to maximize earnings and minimize brokerage interference. If you’re confident in your ability to operate independently and prefer a lean model that keeps more money in your pocket, Fathom offers exactly that. Its tech-forward, flat-fee model favors experienced agents who no longer need expensive branding to validate their business.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway, in contrast, is a solid choice for agents focused on luxury markets who see brand recognition as a key asset in winning high-end listings. The trade-off, however, is steep. Between high splits, never-ending franchise fees, and inconsistent support, it’s not always the best long-term financial move for agents looking to build wealth.</p>\n<p>If neither model delivers the right combination of income, support, and opportunity, you’re not alone—and there’s a better option that combines the best of both.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

The brokerage does not charge any franchise or royalty fees, and agents can cap their production at $12K, after which they keep 100% of their commissions. In addition, Real Broker offers a top agent bonus of $24K, further increasing earning potential. The annual fee at Real Broker is $750, and there are no transaction fees until the cap is reached, simplifying the fee structure.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Berkshire Hathaway’s commission splits range from 60/40 to 90/10. They also charge a 6% franchise fee, which affects the agents’ overall income. Unlike Real Broker, Berkshire Hathaway does not have a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split their commissions with the brokerage regardless of their earnings. Monthly fees at Berkshire Hathaway vary by office, and transaction fees range from $295 to $625, which can add up for high-producing agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker stands out with its revenue share program, allowing agents to earn passive income by recruiting other agents to the brokerage. This additional stream of income helps agents grow their financial base over time. Real Broker also offers a retirement income path and willable income, providing agents with long-term financial stability.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway does not offer a revenue share program or additional income streams such as retirement income paths or willable income. Agents are restricted to earning through commissions, limiting their ability to build long-term wealth outside of transactions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides 30+ live weekly training sessions and 24/7 agent support, giving agents constant access to learning and assistance. This setup benefits agents who are eager to stay ahead of industry trends and who need flexibility in their training schedules.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway offers training, but the quality and availability vary depending on the office location. The brokerage does not provide 24/7 agent support, which could be a drawback for agents who require more hands-on or immediate help, especially in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker’s cloud-based platform is built to provide agents with the latest technology for transaction management, lead generation, and client relationship management. Agents can work flexibly and use advanced tools to streamline their real estate business.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway offers technology tools as well, but these can vary significantly by office. While the brand has strong recognition and a solid reputation, its technology and flexibility might not match Real Broker&#8217;s modern, cloud-based approach.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker maintains a 4.5-star rating on Glassdoor based on 109 reviews. Agents praise the commission structure, revenue share opportunities, and the constant support available through the brokerage.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway has a 4.2-star rating from 981 reviews on Glassdoor.

The production cap is $12K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions, and a top agent bonus of $24K is available for high performers. The annual fee is $750, and transaction fees are $0 until the agent reaches the cap, offering a straightforward fee structure.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker provides commission splits between 55/45 and 90/10. However, agents are required to pay a franchise/royalty fee ranging from 5% to 6.5%, which reduces their overall earnings. Unlike Real Broker, Coldwell Banker does not have a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split their commissions with the brokerage no matter how much they earn. Monthly fees range from $150 to $179 depending on the office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty fees, simplifying some of the costs but making the franchise fees a major consideration for agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides agents with the opportunity to build wealth through a revenue share program, which allows agents to earn additional income by recruiting others to the brokerage. In addition, Real Broker offers a retirement income path and willable income, making it a great choice for agents who want to plan for long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker, however, does not offer a revenue share program or any retirement income path. This limits agents to commission-based income, which may not provide the same financial stability or wealth-building potential that Real Broker offers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker excels in offering continuous training and 24/7 agent support. Agents have access to over 30 live training sessions each week, allowing them to stay up-to-date with industry trends and strategies. The 24/7 support ensures that agents can always get the help they need, which is particularly important for newer agents or those working in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers training that varies by office, and the quality can depend on the specific location. However, the absence of 24/7 support can be a disadvantage for agents who require more flexibility or immediate assistance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker’s technology is built with a cloud-based model, offering agents advanced tools for CRM, marketing, and transaction management. This makes Real Broker particularly appealing to agents who are comfortable using technology to streamline their workflows and grow their business.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker also provides technological tools, though they vary by office. While the brokerage has a long-established presence in the industry, its technology infrastructure may not be as modern or flexible as Real Broker’s.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker has a high Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews, with agents praising the transparent fee structure, revenue share model, and strong agent support.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker has a 4.3-star rating from 2.6K reviews, with agents appreciating the brand’s reputation and extensive network.

With eXp’s unique setup, agents can choose a real estate career focused solely on providing referrals to other agents, skipping the traditional hustle of closing deals themselves.</p>\n<p>The best part? This process can take just seconds, and referral agents save a ton by avoiding mandatory agent expenses that full-service agents have to cover.</p>\n<p>How does eXp make this happen? Once again, eXp Realty is using its size and paying attention to its goal of being the most agent-centric brokerage on the planet. It’s no surprise since eXp has been the only profitable publicly traded brokerage over the past five years!</p>\n<p>Today, we’ll break down everything you need to know about eXp’s referral division and why it’s a game-changer for agents.

The referring agent then negotiates a commission with the agent they referred the client to, and once the deal closes, they get paid.</p>\n<p>Easy, right?

Whether you’re working within the U.S. or internationally, eXp’s platform makes it incredibly easy to send referral business across all 50 states and in 27 countries, thanks to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/locations/\">eXp’s global reach and international real estate network.</a></p>\n<p>While eXp agents are free to send referrals to non-eXp agents, the chances are high that you’ll find the perfect match within eXp’s 89,000+ agents. With eXp’s online agent directory, locating top talent is a breeze.</p>\n<p>What really sets eXp apart is its seamless, tech-powered agent referral tool. The company has built an exclusive online portal designed to make providing and managing referrals super easy. Let’s break it down:</p>\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Log in to eXp’s Referral website and start a new referral.</li>\n<li>Enter your client’s info.</li>\n<li>Search <a href=\"https://exprealty.com/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">eXp Agent Directory</a>, reach out to an agent to see if they’re a fit for your client, and negotiate your referral commission.</li>\n<li>Complete your referral commission agreement, auto-fill the selected agent, and hit submit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Easy peasy. Once you submit the referral, eXp takes it from there. They handle gathering signatures from you, the other agent, and both brokers, and they track the deal until it closes, ensuring you get paid. Note – if you’re providing a buyer referral, you’ll want to upload your referral contract to skyslope to ensure a smooth payment process.</p>\n<p>The platform keeps things smooth and hassle-free while sending you updates at every key step so you’re never left in the dark. With this fast and efficient system, managing referrals has never been easier, and you always stay in control.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-referral-division-saves-agents-money\">eXp Referral Division Saves Agents Money</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"196\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247866\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b6c4287cca4a88c3-eXp-Realty-Referral-Division-Saves-Agents-Money.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty Referral Division, eXp Realty Referral Division Saves Agents Money\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b6c4287cca4a88c3-eXp-Realty-Referral-Division-Saves-Agents-Money.webp/public 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b6c4287cca4a88c3-eXp-Realty-Referral-Division-Saves-Agents-Money.webp/public 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b6c4287cca4a88c3-eXp-Realty-Referral-Division-Saves-Agents-Money.webp/public 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>While all eXp agents enjoy the fast and easy referral business, eXp Realty’s Referral Division is specifically designed for agents who want to focus solely on referrals. For those agents, eXp has created a way to drastically <strong>lower the typical costs</strong> associated with being a real estate agent.</p>\n<p>How? By making referral-only agents part of eXp Commercial. This setup means referral agents don’t need to pay hefty MLS or Realtor association fees—those can add up fast! It’s a massive cost-saver for agents who just want to pass clients along to other agents and not get involved in the actual deal.</p>\n<p>On top of that, eXp has sweetened the deal with a reduced monthly fee for referral-only agents, <strong>cutting costs by more than 40%!</strong> So not only do you avoid MLS and association fees, but you’re also getting an even lower monthly expense than what’s shown in our full breakdown of <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/fees\">eXp Realty fees</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ideal-candidates-for-referral-division\">Ideal Candidates for Referral Division</h2>\n<p>The eXp Referral Division is perfect for agents who want to keep their active real estate license without the grind of day-to-day activities. Instead of juggling listings, open houses, or closing complicated deals, you can focus on generating referral leads.</p>\n<p>Refer potential clients to other agents, sit back, and earn a fee or percentage of the commission when the deal closes—easy as that! Let’s explore which agents will benefit most from this division:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agents-seeking-a-more-balanced-schedule\">Agents Seeking a More Balanced Schedule</h3>\n<p>For agents looking to stay involved in real estate without the pressures of full-time selling, the eXp Referral Division is a game-changer.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re juggling family commitments, exploring other career paths, or simply not ready for the demands of active real estate, this division offers a fantastic middle ground. You can still make money without sacrificing your lifestyle or time.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"part-time-real-estate-professionals\">Part-Time Real Estate Professionals</h3>\n<p>This setup provides the kind of flexibility that traditional real estate roles often lack, allowing you to stay in the game without the full-time commitment. Not every agent wants—or needs—to be in real estate full-time.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself doing fewer deals and questioning whether it’s worth paying for an active license, the referral division could be the answer. By eliminating fees like Realtor association dues, SUPRA fees, and others, this option saves you money while letting you stay in the industry.</p>\n<p>You get to keep your license and earn commissions by handing off leads to active agents—making real estate work for you, on your terms.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"retiring-agents\">Retiring Agents</h3>\n<p>For agents nearing retirement or those stepping back from an active role, the referral division offers the perfect solution. You can still leverage your years of experience by referring clients to other agents.</p>\n<p>This lets you remain connected to the real estate world and generate income, all without the stress of full-time work. It&#8217;s a smooth transition into retirement while maintaining your professional network and expertise.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-referral-divisions-fees\">eXp Referral Divisions Fees</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 64%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Let’s talk numbers! The eXp Referral Division keeps things straightforward and affordable. For just <strong>$50 a month</strong>, you gain access to eXp World, Workplace, and all the tools you’ll need, including Skyslope, My eXp, eXp University, and a global network of professionals. It&#8217;s a small price for staying connected and generating referral income. Here’s the details:</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"770\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7b3074020aa138b2-Refferal-Devision-2.0.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Referral Division included benefits\" class=\"wp-image-248806 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7b3074020aa138b2-Refferal-Devision-2.0.webp/public 600w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7b3074020aa138b2-Refferal-Devision-2.0.webp/public 234w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-referral-divisions-splits\">eXp Realty Referral Divisions Splits</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s break down the splits. When you refer a client to an eXp agent, you keep 75% of the referral fee, and eXp takes 25%. If you refer a client to a non-eXp agent, you pocket 70% while eXp gets 30%.</p>\n<p>So, whether you’re keeping it in the eXp family or referring outside, the division has you covered with a fair, predictable split.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"moving-from-realty-to-referral\">Moving From Realty To Referral</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247868\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e3e437621fe466ce-Moving-From-Realty-To-Referral.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty Referral Division, Moving From Realty To Referral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"201\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e3e437621fe466ce-Moving-From-Realty-To-Referral.webp/public 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e3e437621fe466ce-Moving-From-Realty-To-Referral.webp/public 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e3e437621fe466ce-Moving-From-Realty-To-Referral.webp/public 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Ready to make the shift? Your first step is to contact your state broker team—they&#8217;ll guide you through the process and help you with timing. You&#8217;ll sign a new Independent Contractor Agreement, but don&#8217;t worry, you’ll keep the same sponsor, so no need to start over from scratch!</p>\n<p>Before you switch from Realty to the Referral Division, here’s what to expect: You’ll lose access to Realtor forms and MLS services, but you’ll get a shiny new email address (yourname@expreferral.com) and updated marketing materials reflecting your status with eXp Referral, brokered by eXp Commercial.</p>\n<p>One small caveat: referral agents won’t have access to Regus office spaces anymore. So, while you’ll be saving big on expenses, make sure you’re ready for the trade-offs!  You can find more specifics <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xin9O0zXx9Q2jKrca99-kzSQ1yhUnXZ-fxloIKM_sWc/edit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">Why the eXp Referral Division Just Makes Sense</h2>\n<p>Let’s be real—traditional real estate life isn’t always glamorous. Between sky-high fees, unpredictable closings, and clients who ghost harder than your high school crush, it’s no wonder so many agents eventually ask, “Is there a better way to stay in real estate without losing my mind?”</p>\n<p>The eXp Referral Division is that sweet spot between staying licensed and staying sane. Whether you&#8217;re easing into retirement, juggling a side hustle, or just done with fighting over lockbox codes, this model offers a tech-powered, low-cost way to keep earning without touching a transaction. No MLS fees. No Supra key headaches. Just referrals, clicks, and commission checks.</p>\n<p>And when you combine that with the added value of joining eXp and naming a sponsor like Smart Agent Alliance, you’re getting a rocket ship.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/smart-agent-alliance\">Smart Agent Alliance</a> runs meetings so you gain <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share/\">passive income</a>.
