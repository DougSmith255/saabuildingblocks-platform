That’s it. No “processing fee.”  Just a flat rate that covers everything you need to run a real estate business like a pro—without spending like one.</p>\n<p>New agents to eXp Realty also pay a one-time $64 onboarding fee their first month (translation: $149 to get started). After that? Smooth sailing.</p>\n<p>Here’s what that $85/month gets you—and spoiler: it’s not just access to a logo and an office fridge full of expired LaCroix.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>BoldTrail CRM &#038; IDX website &#8211; aka, the $5,000-a-year tech that agents elsewhere pay for</li>\n<li>SkySlope for managing transactions &#8211; $340 a month for other agents</li>\n<li>eXp University, packed with 50+ live weekly webinars and more than 400 on-demand training sessions that don’t suck</li>\n<li>Canva Pro with eXp Enterprise Marketing Center with plug-and-play professional templates – others pay $10 a month just for Canva Pro (no marketing center)</li>\n<li>Free access to Regus coworking spaces worldwide – others pay $93 a month</li>\n<li>Full access to eXp World, a virtual campus that actually works (unlike your last broker’s website)</li>\n<li>SISU business analytics – others pay $250 a month</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, compare that to traditional real estate brokerage fees, where you’re paying more for less—and sometimes still printing flyers at home. The bottom line? eXp gives you big brokerage tools with agent fees that don’t make your wallet cry. To learn more details about all of these, check out our blog, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/brokerage-fee/\">What eXp Agents Get for Their Real Estate Brokerage Fee – a LOT!</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-transaction-fees-the-fees-that-dont-feel-like-a-scam\">eXp Realty Transaction Fees: The Fees That Don’t Feel Like a Scam</h2>\n<p>At eXp Realty, transaction fees are refreshingly boring. No mystery math, no fine print written by a half-asleep paralegal—just two simple fees that make sense. And one of them even <em>caps</em> (unlike your old brokerage’s patience).</p>\n<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Broker Review Fee: $25 per transaction. That’s someone double-checking your paperwork so you don’t end up explaining a typo to a judge.</li>\n<li>Risk Management / E&#038;O Insurance Fee: $60 per deal, capped at $750 a year. You could pay more… but you won’t.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now compare that to traditional real estate broker fees, where you’re hit with a $2,000+ E&#038;O bill <em>before</em> your first commission check even clears. And it gets better: if you ever do land in legal hot water, eXp’s deductible is just $2,500—not the $10,000+ monster you’ll find lurking in the fine print at many other brokerages.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:41% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"425\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Easy-Transactions.webp\" alt=\"man sitting back and relaxing\" class=\"wp-image-241753 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b0fb06d4462708e0-Easy-Transactions.webp/mobile 425w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b0fb06d4462708e0-Easy-Transactions.webp/mobile 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>With eXp, you only pay these real estate agent fees as you go—and you <em>know</em> when they stop. It&#8217;s budgeting with boundaries. If you’re after a real estate brokerage with the lowest fees <em>and</em> the good sense to protect your bottom line, well… welcome home.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-after-you-cap-at-e-xp-more-money-fewer-fees-no-catch\">What Happens After You Cap at eXp? More Money. Fewer Fees. No Catch.</h2>\n<p>Once you hit that $16,000 commission cap at eXp, the game changes—and for once, it actually benefits <em>you</em>. You go from an 80/20 split to 100% commission, and the only thing you’ll pay per deal is a flat $335. That includes:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>$250 transaction fee</li>\n<li>$60 E&#038;O insurance</li>\n<li>$25 broker review</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No asterisks. No mystery math. No surprise donation to your broker’s secret boat fund.</p>\n<p>And if you&#8217;re one of those high-producing eXp agents closing deals like it’s a competitive sport? You get rewarded <em>again</em>. Once you’ve paid $5,000 in post-cap fees, your cost per deal drops to $75 + $25 broker review.</p>\n<p>Then there are eXp Realty stock awards that can offset most—or all—of your annual fees. Because while other brokerages are handing out paperweight trophies, eXp is handing out ownership.</p>\n<p>This is what a real estate brokerage with the lowest fees <em>should</em> look like—one that rewards success instead of taxing it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"no-desk-fees-no-franchise-cuts-no-royalty-nonsense\">No Desk Fees, No Franchise Cuts, No Royalty Nonsense</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Traditional brokerages love fees like toddlers love glitter—once they start, it’s <em>everywhere</em>. But at eXp Realty, there are zero desk fees, franchise fees, and no royalty fees. Nothing says “thanks for closing that deal” like taking another bite out of your commission&#8230; right?</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Why-Realtors-Shouldnt-Skip-IDX-Integration.webp\" alt=\"exp realty fees, Why Realtors Shouldn’t Skip IDX Integration\" class=\"wp-image-266762 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/c7509fe9a491f5f3-Why-Realtors-Shouldnt-Skip-IDX-Integration.webp/mobile 499w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/c7509fe9a491f5f3-Why-Realtors-Shouldnt-Skip-IDX-Integration.webp/mobile 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>With eXp, what you earn is yours. No paying rent on an office you never sit in. No 6% franchise skim off the top of your already not-great commission split. Just clean, simple numbers that make sense—and make you more money.</p>\n<p>That’s the beauty of a cloud-based brokerage: fewer middlemen, lower brokerage fees, and a structure that’s built for agent profitability, not company overhead. If you’ve been bleeding commission on charges you didn’t agree to (or understand), it’s time to join a real estate broker with the lowest fees—and a little common sense.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hidden-fees-nope-e-xp-realty-doesnt-play-that-game\">Hidden Fees? Nope. eXp Realty Doesn’t Play That Game</h2>\n<p>Do you know what’s worse than high real estate brokerage fees? Surprise ones. The ones that show up uninvited, like your neighbor’s kid at your open-house snack table. Luckily, eXp Realty fees are the opposite of that.</p>\n<p>Every dollar you’ll owe is laid out upfront—monthly fees, transaction fees, the whole shebang. There’s no “admin processing coordination support surcharge” popping up after your first closing. No hidden tech fee. No royalty sneak attack. Just a real estate broker with the lowest fees… who actually tells you what they are.</p>\n<p>Agents stick around at eXp because they can trust the math. And that trust turns into loyalty, productivity, and less time double-checking their commission statements. Real estate agent fees should be predictable. At eXp, they are. And in this industry, that’s practically revolutionary.</p>\n<p>Want to see how these stack up against traditional brokerage fees? We did a full breakdown to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/traditional/\">compare eXp to other brokerages</a> and show where agents lose the most.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-future-of-e-xp-realty-fees-no-sudden-plot-twists\">The Future of eXp Realty Fees: No Sudden Plot Twists</h2>\n<p>In a world where brokerages hike agent fees faster than mortgage rates, eXp Realty has done something wild—<em>kept fees stable</em>. That’s right. While other companies “adjust for inflation” (translation: squeeze agents harder), eXp keeps it consistent.</p>\n<p>The model’s built to evolve with the market—when change happens, it’s to boost agent success, not cover corporate mistakes. So if tweaks are made, they’re made <em>for you</em>, not at your expense.</p>\n<p>This agent-first mindset is why so many pros consider eXp the best real estate brokerage for long-term growth. No sudden fee spikes. No policy shifts that read like a breakup text.

It starts with a straightforward 80/20 model—agents keep 80%, and 20% goes to eXp. No weird math. No sliding scales. No nonsense.</p>\n<p>And unlike traditional brokerages, eXp doesn’t tack on extra costs like franchise fees, royalty charges, or marketing fees that quietly eat away at your commission. Those little “standard” deductions at other brokerages? Yeah, they add up fast.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing: most traditional brokerages don’t publicly advertise their splits. You usually find out during an interview—after they’ve pitched the brand, the office culture, and maybe a cookie or two. From personal experience, conversations with brokerages like Sotheby’s and Compass revealed splits like 70/30… until the extra fees kicked in. With marketing and franchise charges stacked on top, the actual take-home looked more like 64/36. And that’s not uncommon. Curious how others stack up? We break it down in our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/traditional/\">traditional real estate brokerage model comparison</a>.</p>\n<p>At eXp, what you see is what you get. No royalty fees, no desk fees, and no slow drip of deductions that quietly shrink your paycheck. Just a transparent, agent-first model that keeps your money where it belongs—with you.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"160\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/How-Commissions-Work.webp\" alt=\"eXp Commission Split, Real Estate Commission Splits, How Commissions Work\" class=\"wp-image-247760\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3eb1ccec85ea3854-How-Commissions-Work.webp/mobile 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3eb1ccec85ea3854-How-Commissions-Work.webp/mobile 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3eb1ccec85ea3854-How-Commissions-Work.webp/mobile 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-when-you-cap-you-keep-it-all\">What Happens When You Cap? You Keep It All.</h2>\n<p>Once you’ve paid $16,000 into the brokerage (usually after around $80K in gross commission income), you hit your cap—and from then on, you keep 100% of your commissions for the rest of the year. It’s a clean break from outdated models that keep taking no matter how much you close. With eXp, the more you sell, the more you actually keep.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"beyond-the-cap-e-xp-commission-split-rewards-for-top-producers\">Beyond the Cap: eXp Commission Split Rewards for Top Producers</h3>\n<p>The eXp commission split doesn’t stop being generous once you hit your cap. In fact, if you&#8217;re a high-performing agent, it gets even better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/icon-capping-rev-share-incentive-programs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Enter the ICON Agent Program</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you cap and hit key production milestones—like closing 20 more deals or earning $500,000 in GCI with at least 10 transactions—you’re on track for ICON status. You’ll also need to meet eXp’s cultural requirements, which include giving back to the agent community. What’s in it for you? eXp will reward you with $16,000 in company stock. That’s your entire cap contribution, returned.</p>\n<p>So instead of just keeping 100% commission after capping, ICON Agents effectively get a <em>100% split</em> for the year. It’s not just about high splits—it’s about building long-term wealth while you grow your business.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"and-theres-more-stock-awards-for-every-agent\">And There’s More: Stock Awards for Every Agent</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Even if you’re not an ICON Agent yet, you’re still building equity ownership along the way. eXp Realty rewards all agents with stock awards for key milestones—like $200 in stock for your first deal each year and $400 when you cap, again each year.  Plus there are other opportunities to earn company stock.</p>\n<p>So yes, ICON Agents effectively earn 100%+—but really, every agent gets a piece of the pie.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Stock-Ownership-That-Fuels-Agent-Collaboration.webp\" alt=\"Stock Ownership That Fuels Agent Collaboration\" class=\"wp-image-266666 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e59ed721784f7687-Stock-Ownership-That-Fuels-Agent-Collaboration.webp/mobile 500w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e59ed721784f7687-Stock-Ownership-That-Fuels-Agent-Collaboration.webp/mobile 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Stock awards aren’t just a nice bonus—they give you real ownership in the company and a long-term path to building wealth. Plus, you can track everything in your personal stock portal, hosted by Morgan Stanley, making it easy to see how your eXp commission split is turning into something bigger over time.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-one-exception-e-xp-commission-split-for-mentees\">The One Exception: eXp Commission Split for Mentees</h2>\n<p>There’s just one key exception to the standard eXp commission split, and it’s for brand-new agents in the mentorship program. If you’re new to real estate and joining eXp with fewer than three closed transactions, you’ll be paired with a certified mentor to guide you through the basics and best practices.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/How-Agent-Splits-Work.webp\" alt=\"How Agent Splits Work\" class=\"wp-image-266549 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/085789102cfa89a9-How-Agent-Splits-Work.webp/mobile 499w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/085789102cfa89a9-How-Agent-Splits-Work.webp/mobile 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>During your first three deals, the split is 60/20/10/10: you keep 60%, 20% goes to eXp like usual, 10% goes to your mentor and 10% contribution goes to the mentorship program itself. That adds up to a temporary 60/40 split—but with real hands-on guidance and personalized training that helps you start strong.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>After those first three transactions, and meeting some training needs, you graduate from the program and move to the standard 80/20 eXp commission split like everyone else. Simple, supportive, and built to help new agents succeed.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fairness-without-the-fine-print\">Fairness Without the Fine Print</h2>\n<p>Here’s another reason the eXp commission split doesn’t feel like a bait-and-switch: <em>everyone gets the same deal.</em> Whether you’re fresh out of real estate school or you’ve been selling homes since fax machines were a thing, you start with the same 80/20 split and the same $16K cap. No politics. No backroom negotiations. No “prove yourself for three years and maybe we’ll stop taking half your check” nonsense.</p>\n<p>Traditional brokerages? Totally different story. If you’re a top producer, you might get a better split. If you’ve been around forever, maybe you get a perk or two. But if you’re newer or not hitting massive numbers yet, you’re probably funding someone else’s office snacks while you wait for your “turn.”</p>\n<p>At eXp, there is no turn. The playing field is level from day one—and that’s not just fair, it’s refreshing.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"maximize-your-earnings-because-commission-isnt-the-only-game-in-town\">Maximize Your Earnings (Because Commission Isn’t the Only Game in Town)</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The eXp commission split is great on its own, but let’s not stop at “great.” eXp Realty gives agents access to <em>multiple</em> income streams —because who doesn’t love getting paid more than one way? This isn’t just about cashing your next commission check. It’s about building long-term wealth and creating financial stability that doesn&#8217;t disappear the moment a deal closes.</p>\n<p>Here are three seriously powerful ways to stack your income at eXp:</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/exp-realty-revenue-share-blog-featured-image-Web.webp\" alt=\"exp realty revenue share blog featured image Web\" class=\"wp-image-264892 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b17e6955e8ab4c05-exp-realty-revenue-share-blog-featured-image-Web.webp/mobile 900w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b17e6955e8ab4c05-exp-realty-revenue-share-blog-featured-image-Web.webp/mobile 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b17e6955e8ab4c05-exp-realty-revenue-share-blog-featured-image-Web.webp/mobile 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-revenue-share-build-a-team-get-paid-like-a-boss\">1. Revenue Share: Build a Team, Get Paid Like a Boss</h3>\n<p>The eXp commission split already puts more money in your pocket—but the <a href=\"https://www.exprealty.com/income\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revenue share program</a> takes it a step further. When you refer agents to eXp and they join under your sponsorship, you start earning a percentage of the revenue their deals generate. That’s right—you get paid <em>every time they close</em>.</p>\n<p>It’s a seven-tier system, which means as your network grows, so does your passive income. And no, this doesn’t cut into anyone’s commission—revenue share comes out of eXp’s 20%, not the agent’s. Win-win.</p>\n<p>Grow your team, help others thrive, and collect checks while you sleep. Learn more about the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/revenue-share\">revenue share model at eXp Realty</a> and how it stacks up against other brokerages.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-stock-awards-get-a-piece-of-the-company-youre-building\">2. Stock Awards: Get a Piece of the Company You’re Building</h3>\n<p>We’ve talked about the ICON stock awards and the milestone bonuses (like $200 for your first deal and $400 for capping), but there’s another way to grow your ownership at eXp: the optional stock purchase plan.</p>\n<p>Agents can choose to reinvest 5% of their commission into eXp stock (EXPI)—at a 5% discount. So you’re not just earning income, you’re building an equity stake in the company every time you close. It’s automatic, it’s discounted, and it adds up.</p>\n<p>You’re helping build the brokerage—why not own a piece of it?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-referral-fees-get-paid-without-doing-the-work\">3. Referral Fees: Get Paid Without Doing the Work</h3>\n<p>One of the best-kept secrets in real estate? You don’t always have to <em>do</em> the deal to get paid.</p>\n<p>With eXp’s massive global agent network, you can send clients to trusted agents in other markets—and collect a referral fee when the deal closes. That’s it. No showings, no paperwork, no open houses. Just a warm intro, a signed referral agreement, and a check in the mail.</p>\n<p>This kind of income isn’t tied to your time. Build strong agent relationships, keep an ear out for people moving out of your area, and send them off to someone who’ll take great care of them. You stay top-of-mind, help a client, and make money—all without lifting a lockbox.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-personal-deals-100-commission-minimal-fees\">4. Personal Deals: 100% Commission, Minimal Fees</h3>\n<p>Thinking of buying your own home or an investment property? At eXp, agents get to keep 100% of their commission on personal transactions—no cap, no split. Just a small flat ranging $335 transaction fee per deal. That’s it.</p>\n<p>If you’re the kind of agent who plans to buy, sell, or invest personally—this is one of the most underrated perks of the eXp model.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-the-e-xp-commission-split-and-smart-agent-alliance-help-you-thrive\">How the eXp Commission Split and Smart Agent Alliance Help You Thrive</h2>\n<p>The eXp commission split is one of the most agent-friendly in the industry—but real success comes from more than just a great split. At eXp, agents thrive in a culture of collaboration, sharing strategies and support through virtual networking, masterminds, and national events.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Smart Agent Alliance takes that even further.

After that, you keep 100% of your commission for the rest of your anniversary year.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What happens after I cap?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">You earn 100% commission, and if you qualify as an ICON Agent, you can get that $16K back in stock.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">How does the mentorship split work for new agents?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">For your first three transactions, the split is 60/20/10/10—60% to you, 20% to eXp, 10% to your mentor, and 10% to the mentorship program. After that and meeting training needs, you move to the standard 80/20.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">How does revenue share work?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">You earn a percentage of the company’s 20% commission from any agent you sponsor into eXp—and from their recruits too, up to seven tiers deep. It can be true passive income although sponsors like Smart Agent Alliance are far from earning passively as they are dedicated to working for their agents to gain their own passive income.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Can I buy eXp stock at a discount?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Yes!

You also earn stock for hitting milestones.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Do I pay commission on my own deals?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">No split on personal deals.

These moments act like cautionary tales, hopefully reminding us of the challenges we may encounter.</p>\n<h3>2. Must-See Real Estate Classics</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">If you want to really know real estate, watch the classics such as “The Big Short” (2015). They nail the spirit of the industry. This film delves into the housing crisis of 2008. It sheds light on the financial systems that drove the crisis.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The performances, especially by the ensemble cast, bring to life the stark realities of the industry. You’re forgetting “Pacific Heights” from 1990! It&#8217;s got a hell of a story, in this case about a couple experiencing extreme tenant hell in their Victorian. This thriller highlights the dark side of property ownership and the unexpected challenges it can bring.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">3. Modern Real Estate Dramas</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">In recent years, films such as &#8220;99 Homes&#8221; (2014) have highlighted contemporary real estate issues. Set in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, this film follows a father who loses his home.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">As he navigates this challenging situation, he wrestles with painful moral choices in his quest to support his family. The characters&#8217; journey reflects the ongoing struggles of many facing housing instability today.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These films provide such a rich tapestry of stories; they are kind of like the real estate world because they&#8217;re just behind the curtain. They deliver entertainment that’s irresistible to us.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Additionally, they provide a singular perspective for how we view past and present struggles in the space.</p>\n<h2 class=\"pm-align--left\">Key Themes in Real Estate Films</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Real estate films tend to delve into themes that resonate, pun intended. These flicks don’t simply entertain; they teach us the big picture. From how we handle property to how it reflects society’s challenges, these movies have plenty to say.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Let&#8217;s break it down:</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">1. Real Estate and Power Dynamics</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Real estate films frequently depict the tug of war between buyers, sellers, and agents. It feels like a chess game, with everyone trying to gain an advantage. Take “Glengarry Glen Ross” or “The Big Short” — they illustrate how money influences deals and distorts facts. It’s interesting to see just how much of a grip money can have over these trades.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Then, there’s the question of socio-economic status. Films such as “99 Homes” highlight how your financial standing can completely shift your experience in the housing market. You see characters faking the hustle to get on board or farming themselves out to get a foot in the door.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This portrayal serves as a telling reflection of real-world challenges. The struggles depicted in these films resonate with many viewers, showcasing the harsh realities faced by individuals trying to navigate the complex landscape of real estate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">2. Economic Crises and Housing</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When the economy takes a dip, it has a massive impact on the real estate market, and movies nail that. Films like &#8220;The Big Short&#8221; focus on the pandemonium that ensues after money collapses. They teach us the grim realities of foreclosure and financial ruin.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These narratives aren’t just stories; they’re warnings for those looking to invest or buy a home. It’s more like a wake-up call saying, “Hey, watch out!” when you’re dealing with property. These films drive home how fragile the market can be.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">3. Personal Stories and Homes</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Homes aren’t just buildings; they’re part of our stories. Movies like “Up” or “The Pursuit of Happyness” incorporate personal stories into the notion of home. They showcase family dynamics and the ties that turn a house into a home.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">In these stories, characters often seek belonging and stability, showing how important homeownership can be. It’s not just about owning a place; it’s about finding a place where you fit in and feel safe.</p>\n<h2 class=\"pm-align--left\">Lessons for Real Estate Professionals</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">It’s not just for fun; there are a lifetime of lessons that we can learn from movies. Let’s get into how real estate flicks can teach us about being better agents and brokers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">1. Understanding Market Trends</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The movies often replicate real-world changing markets, and characters need to adapt. Films like &#8220;The Big Short&#8221; give us a view of market crashes and booms and how agents adapt.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Seeing these characters demonstrates how key it is to keep your finger on the pulse of trends. You have to react in real-time and stay on top of everything!</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Real estate agents actively analyze data and predict trends in these films. These are skills that translate into success in the real world.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">It&#8217;s just important to know about a financial crisis. In “<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Wolf of Wall Street</a>,” it’s all about stocks. The lessons about being prepared for the worst are equally relevant to the world of real estate.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Keeping yourself organized and on track, particularly in uncertain times, will help you weather these types of occurrences. Understanding the dynamics of financial markets can provide valuable insights that apply across different sectors, including real estate.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By staying informed and proactive, you can better navigate potential downturns and make sound decisions that protect your investments.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">2. Navigating Ethical Dilemmas</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Ethical issues in real estate have been vividly depicted in many movies. One notable example is &#8220;The Wolf of Wall Street,&#8221; which serves as a parade of how not to conduct business in the industry.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The lessons highlighted in this film emphasize the need for honesty and transparency in all dealings. Manipulating clients doesn’t just hurt them; it also significantly damages your reputation in the long run.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Moreover, getting too comfortable in your position can lead to complacency, which can further exacerbate ethical lapses. It’s crucial to remain vigilant and committed to ethical practices to maintain integrity in real estate.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Movies push you to consider the moral consequences of tactics and relationships. They often present complex scenarios that challenge our understanding of right and wrong.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These narratives can ignite conversations regarding integrity. They encourage viewers to reflect on their own values and the implications of their choices.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Moreover, films help us remember that although being ethical is the right thing to do, it also lays the groundwork for future success. Upholding integrity can foster trust and build stronger relationships, both personally and professionally.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">3. Building Client Relationships</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The heart of real estate is trust and open communication. Solid client relationships are built out of a commitment to honesty.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Films illustrate this concept effectively. For instance, “Glengarry Glen Ross” stresses the importance of listening to clients’ wants. It also emphasizes the need for clear communication throughout the real estate process.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Here are some key takeaways from movies:</p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\"><strong>Be honest and transparent</strong> to build trust.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\"><strong>Don’t manipulate clients</strong>; it can cost you their trust.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\"><strong>Stay organized</strong> to handle chaos with ease.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Don&#8217;t become overly fond of a deal; advocate for what’s best for the client.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"pm-align--left\">Cultural Significance of Real Estate in Cinema</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Real estate movies both entertain us and reflect our world. They reflect what we hold dear and exhibit what society deems important. When we watch characters chase their dreams of homeownership, we see a powerful reflection of the American Dream. Their journey inspires us to pursue our own aspirations.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This time-honored idea that success means having your own piece of land is prevalent in many films. Movies such as “The Pursuit of Happyness” and “It’s a Wonderful Life” emphasize the importance of owning a home. They show how reaching this peak of success is usually considered a major marker of achievement.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These films speak to our hunger for stability and success. They depict the dream house as a potent symbol of accomplishment and fulfillment. Through their narratives, they highlight the emotional and social significance of homeownership in our lives.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">Influence on Public Perception</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Movies have a huge influence on how we perceive <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\">the real estate industry</a>. Ever notice how they portray real estate agents? They tend to appear too slick and untrustworthy. This is especially prevalent in “Glengarry Glen Ross,” which shows a more cutthroat side of sales.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These portrayals can color how we perceive the profession, often magnifying tropes that are not always fair. There&#8217;s more to it than just the agents. Movies can highlight the ups and downs of the housing market, informing how we think about buying and selling homes.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">For example, movies about a housing bubble can put us on edge about market crashes, even if they&#8217;re pure fantasy. Stereotypes in real estate films portray agents as manipulative or greedy. The premise of the housing market is unstable or risky.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">Reflection of Societal Changes</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Over time, real estate movies have changed, mirroring a shift in our society. They illustrate how our attitudes toward housing have evolved. Older films often presented suburban life as the ideal place to be. In contrast, new movies delve into the attraction of living in cities.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Films such as &#8220;The Big Short&#8221; portray the nuances of contemporary housing problems, highlighting economic difficulties and varied community experiences. In addition, these films show how society&#8217;s values regarding our living situations have changed over time. Now, we’re seeing a move away from large suburban homes and a celebration of diverse living arrangements.</p>\n<h2 class=\"pm-align--left\">Notable Mentions</h2>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">Lesser-Known Gems</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Let’s get out some hidden gems! These hidden gems may not be on everyone&#8217;s list, but they offer deep dives into the real estate realm.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">One such movie is “Pacific Heights.” It’s a gripping suspense thriller that vividly portrays Patty and Drake’s struggles as they restore a Victorian house. This movie delivers with such riveting performances. The nerve-wracking storyline keeps audiences glued to the screen.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Another noteworthy film is &#8220;And So It Goes,&#8221; which gets a fresh twist with its romantic comedy vibe. In this story, a self-centered realtor&#8217;s life turns upside down after his granddaughter comes into his life. While they may not be marquee titles, these movies pack a punch with entertaining stories and thematic substance.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">In any case, let&#8217;s examine some themes that help these films sparkle. Glengarry Glen Ross,” for example, takes us behind the scenes of real estate sales at its most cutthroat. Alec Baldwin&#8217;s portrayal of Blake is legendary, as he represents the do-or-die atmosphere of the environment where only the best survive.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Even “The Open House,” which begins with a perfectly ordinary open house, builds tension immediately. It turns into this really great tale where it goes into the bad side of real estate. These films are interesting for their messages and their performances, which help them stand out among real estate movies.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">Unique Perspectives on Real Estate</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Catch Me If You Can” explores uncharted waters with its compelling story. While it’s not about real estate, it does illuminate good sales practices through Frank Abagnale’s clever impersonations. His application of timeless sales tactics reflects <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/real-estate-agent-strategies/\">real estate strategies</a>, and it strikes viewers as an unexpected parallel.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">On the other hand, “The Wolf of Wall Street” delves into the stockbroking industry. It also touches on themes of ambition and ethical dilemmas that resonate with the real estate industry. Both films offer insights into the world of sales, albeit from different perspectives, highlighting the importance of strategy and ethics in achieving success.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These films break the mold of conventional narratives, showcasing real estate from various perspectives. They push boundaries with innovative storytelling, engaging audiences in new and exciting ways.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These movies combine suspense, comedy, and unusual jobs. They repurpose the way we view real estate on screen. The impact? Audiences connect with the themes and characters. In doing so, this connection creates a deeper cinematic experience for them.</p>\n<h2 class=\"pm-align--left\">Explore More Films</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Let’s take a look at some notable films featuring the real estate world. These non-Harry films may encourage you to seek out a few more films!</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These films do more than entertain; they show you the drama and intricacies of life in real estate. First, we’ll dig into documentaries that unveil the reality of housing markets. Next, we switch to fun comedies that mix humor with valuable real estate lessons.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">Documentaries on Housing Markets</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Documentaries are a goldmine for real-world information, particularly when it comes to the housing market. They offer behind-the-scenes insights into what the real estate industry is like. This is great education for both professionals and enthusiasts.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">While &#8220;The Big Short&#8221; is not a documentary, it is based on true events. The film tells the story of what happened during the 2008 housing crash. Featuring an all-star cast, including Christian Bale and Steve Carell, it effectively charts the complicated financial instruments and decisions that set the crisis in motion.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Moreover, &#8220;The Big Short&#8221; presents personal stories that bring a human side to data and statistics. This narrative approach makes it a powerful tool for understanding housing issues. By blending factual events with character-driven storytelling, the film engages viewers and educates them about the complexities of the housing market.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pm-align--left\">Comedies with Real Estate Themes</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Who says real estate can’t be funny? There are lots of comedies that incorporate real estate themes in their stories, providing a source of both laughter and knowledge.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These films present serious subjects like housing and homeownership in an approachable and relatable way through comedy. Comedic storytelling works well with real estate messages, doing so in a lighthearted yet meaningful manner.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Movies such as “Glengarry Glen Ross,” starring Al Pacino, provide moments of dramatic intensity, not humor. They also shed some light on the pressures real estate salesmen face in a profession that doesn&#8217;t see the vast majority of people who enter it; only 2% become successful.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Here are some must-watch films for your real estate-themed movie night:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"pm-align--left\"><strong>The Big Short &#8211;</strong> This film delves into the 2008 financial crisis, highlighting the housing market&#8217;s collapse. It follows a group of investors who predicted the crisis and bet against the housing market. The movie offers a gripping look at the complexities of real estate finance and the consequences of unchecked speculation.</li>\n<li class=\"pm-align--left\"><strong>Glengarry Glen Ross &#8211;</strong> A classic film that showcases the cutthroat world of real estate sales. It follows a group of salesmen who are under immense pressure to succeed. The film explores themes of ambition, desperation, and the moral dilemmas faced in the pursuit of success.</li>\n<li class=\"pm-align--left\"><strong>Pacific Heights &#8211;</strong> This thriller revolves around a couple who rent out a unit in their San Francisco home to a seemingly charming tenant. However, they soon discover that he has sinister intentions. The film highlights the challenges of property management and the potential dangers of renting.</li>\n<li class=\"pm-align--left\"><strong>99 Homes &#8211;</strong> This drama tells the story of a man who loses his home to foreclosure and is forced to work for the real estate broker who evicted him. It provides a poignant look at the impact of the housing crisis on individuals and families. The film raises questions about ethics in real estate and the struggle for survival.</li>\n<li class=\"pm-align--left\"><strong>The Money Pit &#8211;</strong> A comedic take on home renovation, this film follows a couple who buy a dilapidated mansion. They quickly realize that their dream home comes with a host of unexpected problems. The movie captures the trials and tribulations of homeownership and renovation in a humorous light.</li>\n<li class=\"pm-align--left\"><strong>House of Cards &#8211;</strong> While primarily a political drama, this series features significant real estate themes, particularly in the context of power and influence. The characters often engage in real estate deals that reflect their ambitions and strategies. It offers a unique perspective on how real estate intersects with politics and personal gain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These films not only entertain but also provide valuable insights into the world of real estate, making them perfect for your themed movie night.</p>\n<h2 class=\"pm-align--left\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Going down the rabbit hole of real estate movies, you have a trove of stories and lessons. These films reveal the hustle of the industry and showcase the human side of the deals. They provide viewers with far more than entertainment. They provide real insight and provoke thought. From understanding market dynamics to seeing the emotional ties to property, movies shine a light on every facet.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">For anyone in or interested in the real estate world, these films are required viewing.

    "content": "<p>Choosing the right brokerage is one of the most important decisions in your real estate career. It’s not just about commission splits or monthly fees—it’s about finding a platform that lets you build income, grow faster, and scale with less overhead. In this article, we’re comparing two big names with very different approaches: Fathom Realty and RE/MAX.</p>\n<p>Fathom promotes financial independence through a flat-fee structure, while RE/MAX leans on legacy branding and structured training. If you&#8217;re debating between a commission-heavy model and a prestige-focused brokerage, this breakdown will help you weigh the actual value each one brings—and what might be missing entirely.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#fathom-vs-re-max-commission-splits-and-fees\">Fathom vs. RE/MAX: Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-verdict-fathom-vs-re-max\">Final Verdict: Fathom vs. RE/MAX</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fathom-vs-re-max-commission-splits-and-fees\">Fathom vs. RE/MAX: Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty gives agents two plan options. On the Share Plan, agents earn an 88/12 split until they reach a $12,000 cap, after which they keep 100% of their commission. On the Max Plan, agents receive 100% commission from day one, with a $9,000 production cap. There are no franchise or royalty fees, and the company charges a flat $700 annual fee. Transaction fees are $165 per sale under the Share Plan and $465 per sale under the Max Plan, with an additional $250 added for every $500,000 in sales price over that threshold. Each sale also comes with a $35 charge for E&#038;O insurance.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX uses a variable commission structure, usually ranging from 60/40 to 95/5, and includes a 5% franchise fee. Monthly office fees often exceed $2,000, which means agents need consistent production just to stay profitable. For an agent earning $100,000 in commission on a 70/30 split, it’s common to walk away with less than $60,000 after fees are accounted for.</p>\n<p>Fathom’s approach is much leaner, favoring agents who value low overhead and predictable costs. RE/MAX appeals more to agents who believe the brand name will open doors—but those doors come with high price tags and thinner margins.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest updates to Fathom Realty’s model is the addition of revenue share. Agents can now earn additional income by attracting others to the company. While this isn’t as robust as other platforms offering stock equity or retirement benefits, it’s still a meaningful change from their old single-stream model. There is still no willable income path, no equity programs, and no production-based stock awards or top agent bonuses.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX, in contrast, continues to operate without any revenue share, profit share, or equity rewards. Agents at RE/MAX do not earn income from mentoring others, growing a team, or reaching production goals beyond their commission. You’re essentially paying to use the brand without gaining any scalable income benefits in return.</p>\n<p>Agents today are looking for more than just a paycheck. They want to build multiple income streams—income that continues whether they’re actively selling or not. This is where Fathom’s update helps, but it’s still not quite competitive with the more modern hybrid models on the market.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers no formal training. There’s no onboarding, no live coaching, and no structured support system. Agents are expected to already know how to succeed or figure it out on their own. This approach may work for highly experienced agents who prefer complete autonomy, but it can be a barrier for new agents or anyone entering a new market.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX does provide training resources through RE/MAX University. The platform includes a wide range of pre-recorded courses and materials covering everything from contracts to marketing. However, the training is mostly self-guided and lacks the hands-on mentorship or real-time coaching many agents now expect. The tools are there, but you have to be disciplined and motivated enough to make use of them on your own.</p>\n<p>Top agents in 2025 are prioritizing live masterminds, strategy sessions, and performance coaching as part of their daily business rhythm. Brokerages that build this kind of support into their culture are helping agents accelerate results far faster than those offering static content libraries.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom’s tech stack is intentionally simple. Agents receive access to a functional CRM, transaction management tools, and basic marketing templates. For agents who already have their own systems in place or prefer a no-frills approach, this may be enough. But for those looking to scale, the lack of integrated lead generation, automation tools, or AI support will likely require additional investments out of pocket.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX includes more tech in its offering. The company provides branded marketing platforms, customizable CRMs, and websites. However, these come bundled with expensive monthly fees, often exceeding $2,000. That’s more than $24,000 per year—enough to buy your own tech stack, hire a VA, or run aggressive paid ads.</p>\n<p>Agents who want to scale efficiently are increasingly drawn to brokerages that provide enterprise-level tech tools at no extra cost. These tools, when built into the model, allow agents to focus on growing their business rather than managing overhead or stitching together third-party solutions.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty has earned a 4.6 out of 5 rating on Glassdoor, with agents applauding the transparency and low cost. Many love the freedom and straightforward fee structure. However, some agents report frustration over the lack of growth opportunities and support. The most common theme is that Fathom is great for self-starters, but not ideal for agents looking to build a team or receive consistent mentorship.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX earns a slightly lower rating of 4.2 out of 5. Veteran agents often praise the reputation of the brand, but newer agents and those in competitive markets point out that the high fees cut into profit and support can be inconsistent. A frequent comment is that agents feel like they’re paying top dollar for a logo without receiving real value in return.</p>\n<p>In today’s market, satisfaction isn’t just about splits—it’s about whether the brokerage feels like a partner or just a place to hang your license.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-verdict-fathom-vs-re-max\">Final Verdict: Fathom vs. RE/MAX</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a solid choice for agents who want to keep more of their money and don’t need much support or structure. If you’re confident, self-sufficient, and not interested in paying for extras you don’t use, Fathom gives you financial clarity with few surprises.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX may be a better fit for agents who still believe in brand prestige and want access to a basic library of training. But the monthly costs can easily outweigh the benefits, especially for those who aren’t consistently closing deals.</p>\n<p>Still, both models leave something on the table.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.<strong></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n<li>We don’t believe in &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; real estate.

    "content": "<p>For real estate agents choosing between Fathom Realty and Sotheby’s International Realty, the decision often comes down to one pivotal question: is luxury branding really worth the price tag? On one side, you have Fathom’s clean-cut, 100% commission model that lets agents keep every dollar they earn. It&#8217;s a magnet for independent, cost-conscious agents who prioritize net income over brand name. On the other side is Sotheby’s—a legacy luxury brand that brings instant credibility but charges dearly for the privilege, with commission splits, franchise fees, and other costs that can siphon away 30 to 40 percent of your commission.</p>\n<p>But as the real estate industry evolves, more agents are questioning this binary choice. Why sacrifice profitability for branding or branding for autonomy when modern brokerages are starting to blend the best of both? In this breakdown, we’ll compare the structure, support, and agent experience at both Fathom and Sotheby’s, while exploring the growing appeal of newer brokerage models that don’t force you to choose between income and sophistication.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-structures-a-tale-of-two-philosophies\">Commission Structures: A Tale of Two Philosophies</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-potential-beyond-commissions\">Income Potential Beyond Commissions</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support-systems-compared\">Training and Support Systems Compared</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-marketing-resources\">Technology and Marketing Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction-and-cultural-fit\">Agent Satisfaction and Cultural Fit</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#the-verdict-who-each-model-serves-best\">The Verdict: Who Each Model Serves Best</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-structures-a-tale-of-two-philosophies\">Commission Structures: A Tale of Two Philosophies</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a straightforward proposition. Agents choose between a Share Plan with an 88/12 split that caps at $12,000 before switching to 100%, or a Max Plan offering 100% from day one with a lower $9,000 cap. There are no franchise or royalty fees. Annual costs hover around $700, and per-transaction fees are either $165 under the Share Plan or $465 under the Max Plan, with additional charges only on higher-priced sales. For high-volume agents, the savings are hard to ignore. An agent producing $10 million in volume could save over $300,000 per year compared to traditional split-based models—enough to fund a premium ad budget, a full-time assistant, or a vacation home.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s takes the opposite approach, charging agents commission splits ranging from 70/30 to 90/10 along with a 6% franchise fee and additional costs that often lack transparency. Just their E&#038;O insurance alone starts at $2,200 annually. While these expenses may be justified for agents consistently closing $5 million luxury properties, they often hit mid-tier agents the hardest. For example, an agent selling a $1.5 million listing at Sotheby’s with an 80/20 split might walk away with just $33,600 after fees. That same deal at Fathom could yield around $44,550—nearly $11,000 more per sale, lost simply to brand overhead.</p>\n<p>Agents who once felt trapped between these extremes are now looking toward hybrid brokerages that offer generous commission caps alongside luxury-grade branding resources and collaborative communities. These models aim to provide the polish of Sotheby’s with the profitability of Fathom—without the financial drain.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-potential-beyond-commissions\">Income Potential Beyond Commissions</h3>\n<p>Both Fathom and Sotheby’s reveal their limitations when it comes to long-term wealth building. At Fathom, your income stops the moment your closings do. There’s no revenue share, no stock equity, and no retirement plan. While it’s perfect for agents who want to earn and keep as much as possible right now, it leaves no room for passive income or business continuity.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s doesn’t do much better. Despite its global presence and massive referral network, the company doesn’t offer formal team-building incentives, equity options, or passive income systems. You’re leveraging the brand, but once again, the only way to earn is to close more sales. This absence of alternative income streams is a missed opportunity—especially for agents with deep client networks and long-term relationships that could be monetized beyond single transactions.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, forward-thinking brokerages are rolling out models that give agents access to multiple revenue paths. Some offer revenue share for team growth, stock rewards for production milestones, and even profit-sharing or retirement matching programs. These options allow agents to build businesses that scale beyond their own transaction count—something neither Fathom nor Sotheby’s has meaningfully addressed.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support-systems-compared\">Training and Support Systems Compared</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty’s approach to training is minimal at best. New agents receive no formal onboarding, and even experienced professionals entering the luxury market will find no structured guidance on how to navigate high-net-worth clientele or complex listings. It’s a model built on self-sufficiency, which works for seasoned agents—but leaves newer agents or those transitioning to luxury with a steep learning curve.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s does offer more robust training, but the experience depends entirely on the office you’re affiliated with. Some agents benefit from excellent coaching and mentorship, while others find themselves left with generic presentations and dated onboarding sessions. One consistent complaint across both brokerages is the lack of responsive, real-time support. For agents handling multi-million-dollar negotiations on tight timelines, the absence of 24/7 backup can be a dealbreaker.</p>\n<p>Brokerages that are redefining support today typically combine on-demand training libraries with live daily coaching and full-time transaction assistance. These resources are essential in luxury real estate, where the stakes are high, clients are demanding, and every detail matters.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-marketing-resources\">Technology and Marketing Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom provides basic back-end tools like transaction management systems and limited marketing templates. But agents are largely expected to source and pay for their own CRM, lead generation platforms, and automation tools. That may work for tech-savvy agents who want to choose their own stack, but in luxury real estate, a bare-bones setup can put you at a disadvantage. High-end clients expect polished virtual tours, AI-driven property alerts, and seamless digital experiences—and at Fathom, those services aren’t built into the model.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s makes a bigger investment in marketing, especially when it comes to presentation. Glossy brochures, branded listing packages, and global syndication are all part of the draw. But many agents report that these tools are more about brand consistency than business efficiency. The backend systems often feel outdated and disconnected, lacking the automation and customization capabilities today’s agents expect.</p>\n<p>The most effective brokerages now combine branding excellence with real business-building tools. They provide integrated CRMs designed for luxury clients, AI tools for nurturing high-net-worth leads, and automated marketing suites that deliver premium campaigns with minimal agent effort. These platforms save time, increase visibility, and elevate the experience for both agents and clients.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction-and-cultural-fit\">Agent Satisfaction and Cultural Fit</h3>\n<p>Glassdoor reviews provide an honest peek behind the curtain. Fathom Realty receives high marks for financial freedom, consistently scoring around 4.6 out of 5. Agents love the control and low fees, but many note that the experience can feel isolating. One agent summed it up by saying, “You’ll keep more money, but you’ll hit a ceiling unless you’re extremely self-motivated.”</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s earns a solid 4.0 out of 5, with many agents citing the prestige and networking opportunities as key benefits. But a deeper look reveals growing frustration with outdated systems and fee structures that don’t match today’s expectations. As one veteran agent put it, “It’s a great brand, but the cost only makes sense if you’re closing high-end listings every month.”</p>\n<p>Agents today are searching for a mix of transparency, affordability, brand strength, and collaborative energy. They want a culture that prioritizes both financial gain and professional development, not just one or the other.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-verdict-who-each-model-serves-best\">The Verdict: Who Each Model Serves Best</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a great fit for agents who already have their systems in place and want to keep as much of their income as possible. It’s ideal for high-volume producers working in mid-tier markets or experienced professionals who don’t need mentorship or marketing help. If you’re confident running your business solo, it’s a profitable model—but it comes with limitations.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s makes sense for agents in luxury-heavy markets who can truly leverage the brand. If you’re consistently listing $3 million and up properties and want to align with a heritage name that opens doors, the cost may be justified. But for agents selling homes in the $1–2 million range, the math can be tough to swallow, especially with no additional income options or true business scalability.</p>\n<p>Still, both models leave something on the table.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.<strong></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n<li>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>When real estate agents compare Fathom Realty and Compass, the contrast is immediately clear. The two brokerages serve different types of agents, with completely different takes on commission splits, technology, and support. For agents trying to decide where to align their career, the choice often comes down to what matters more—keeping more of your income or accessing sleek tools and polished branding.</p>\n<p>This comparison will unpack the core differences between Fathom and Compass, covering everything from fees and income potential to training, tech, and agent satisfaction. And if neither quite fits, we’ll also show you why more agents are choosing a hybrid path that blends profitability, innovation, and growth.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Compass</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a standout commission model that allows agents to keep 100% of their commissions. There are no franchise or royalty fees, and the structure is intentionally simple. Agents pay around $700 a year in basic fees and between $165 and $465 per transaction depending on the plan they choose. There’s no production cap, and agents aren’t penalized with hidden charges as their business grows. While there’s no top agent bonus, the cost transparency and income retention make Fathom a strong option for agents who want control over their finances.</p>\n<p>Compass takes a much different approach. Agents typically operate on commission splits ranging from 60/40 to 92.5/7.5, depending on experience, volume, and location. There’s also a 6% franchise fee and no production cap, which means even high-producing agents must continue splitting commissions. Monthly desk fees start at $145 and vary widely by market, and some agents report additional transaction fees that can go as high as 4% of the deal. For agents in luxury or urban markets, the branding and support may be worth it—but for many, the costs can feel excessive, especially without an income cap in place.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>When it comes to building wealth beyond commission, neither brokerage goes the extra mile. Fathom Realty offers no revenue share model, stock equity, retirement program, or willable income path. What you earn is entirely based on what you sell, which works for agents focused on quick income but doesn’t offer much for those thinking long-term.</p>\n<p>Compass mirrors this limitation. Despite its reputation for innovation, Compass has not introduced a revenue share model, team-building incentives, or profit-sharing for agents. Income is tied solely to closings, with no additional paths for passive earnings or ownership stake in the company. This can be a dealbreaker for agents seeking financial leverage beyond their next transaction.</p>\n<p>As the industry evolves, more agents are looking beyond these traditional models and seeking brokerages that reward leadership, production milestones, and long-term loyalty with additional income streams.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers very little in the way of structured training. There are no formal education programs and no 24/7 agent support. While this minimalist approach may suit experienced agents who don’t need handholding, newer agents or those switching markets often find themselves struggling to fill in the gaps on their own.</p>\n<p>Compass does offer more on this front through its Compass Academy. Training programs are available and often tailored to agent skill-building and technology adoption. However, real-time support is still lacking. There is no 24/7 live help for agents managing time-sensitive negotiations or complex deals. This can leave agents feeling unsupported during critical transactions, even when they’re paying top dollar to be affiliated with the brand.</p>\n<p>In today’s market, agents thrive in environments that combine self-paced learning with real-time mentorship and hands-on support. Without those elements, both Fathom and Compass fall short of what’s now considered best-in-class brokerage training.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty provides the basics: a working CRM, a transaction management platform, and simple marketing templates. But beyond that, agents are expected to supply and pay for their own tools, lead systems, and automation. This lean model is ideal for agents who already have a tech stack in place, but can be a hindrance for anyone looking for built-in efficiency or scale.</p>\n<p>Compass has built much of its reputation around proprietary tech. Its platform offers sleek design, digital marketing assets, client collaboration tools, and a centralized hub for transaction management. These tools appeal strongly to agents in luxury or high-volume markets where branding and workflow speed matter. However, all of it comes at a cost. Between high commission splits, monthly fees, and add-ons, agents often question whether the technology truly pays for itself.</p>\n<p>Modern agents increasingly expect their brokerage to provide enterprise-level tools without charging enterprise-level fees. Brokerages that bundle these systems at no extra cost are gaining ground quickly.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty holds a 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor based on hundreds of reviews. Agents consistently praise the simplicity of the financial model and the freedom to run their business without corporate interference. The most common downside is the lack of mentorship and community, with some agents noting that it can feel isolating if you’re not extremely self-motivated.</p>\n<p>Compass, on the other hand, has a 3.7-star rating across a much larger pool of reviews. Many agents love the branding, the tech, and the modern feel of the company. But there’s a recurring theme in the negative feedback: the commission splits and fees are hard to justify, especially for agents who aren’t consistently working the luxury segment. Some also mention that the company’s culture feels more like a corporate tech startup than a collaborative real estate team.</p>\n<p>What agents value most right now is a brokerage that feels like a business partner, not just a paycheck processor. Transparency, scalability, and meaningful support make the difference—and too often, both Fathom and Compass fall short of delivering all three.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Compass</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty makes the most sense for experienced agents who want to keep as much of their income as possible. If you don’t need training, support, or technology baked into your brokerage and you prefer a simple fee structure, it’s a strong, low-cost option. The lack of growth incentives or additional income paths might be a concern, but for self-directed agents, the model works.</p>\n<p>Compass is a compelling choice for agents in luxury or tech-forward markets who want to leverage sleek tools and polished branding. The proprietary platform and modern marketing materials can help you stand out—if you’re willing to accept higher fees, lower splits, and no real financial leverage beyond your next deal.</p>\n<p>For agents seeking both profitability and professional development, it’s worth asking whether either brokerage offers the full picture. Increasingly, agents are saying no—and turning to more modern models that blend the best of both.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

LPT Realty also has a production cap of $15K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions. The brokerage provides agents with stock-based bonuses, which can increase earnings further. Monthly fees at LPT vary, starting from $0 plus transaction fees of $195 before the cap is reached.</p>\n<p>Corcoran, on the other hand, offers commission splits between 50/50 and 70/30, which are less favorable than LPT Realty’s top-tier splits. Corcoran charges a 6% franchise fee, and unlike LPT Realty, there is no production cap, meaning agents will continue to share their commissions with the brokerage no matter how much they earn. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the franchise fees, offering predictability, but the lower commission splits and ongoing fees may limit earnings potential for agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out by offering a revenue share model, allowing agents to earn additional income by recruiting new agents to the brokerage. Additionally, LPT Realty provides a retirement income path and willable income, giving agents more ways to secure long-term financial stability.</p>\n<p>Corcoran does not offer a revenue share program, retirement income path, or willable income. Agents at Corcoran rely solely on commissions for their earnings, which may limit long-term income potential compared to LPT Realty’s multiple income streams.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers minimal training and no 24/7 support, which may be a limitation for agents who require consistent guidance. While the brokerage focuses on providing agents with freedom and flexibility, it may not be ideal for those who value robust training programs.</p>\n<p>Corcoran offers training that varies by office, so the quality of training depends largely on the location. While there is no 24/7 support, Corcoran’s agents benefit from being part of a luxury brand with a strong reputation in high-end markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides modern technology and marketing tools, offering agents access to systems that help streamline transactions and boost productivity. However, the technology is relatively basic compared to other brokerages, which may be a drawback for tech-savvy agents.</p>\n<p>Corcoran is known for its luxury market focus and offers advanced marketing tools geared toward high-end properties. While it lacks cloud-based flexibility, Corcoran’s tech and marketing are highly effective in helping agents succeed in the luxury market.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a 4.3-star rating on Glassdoor from 37 reviews, with agents praising the commission splits and additional income opportunities. However, some agents mention the need for more training and support.</p>\n<p>Corcoran holds a 4.4-star rating from 321 reviews on Glassdoor, with agents appreciating the brand reputation and marketing resources, though the lower commission splits and high fees are frequently mentioned as downsides.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-corcoran\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Corcoran</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers more flexible commission splits, lower fees, and better income opportunities through its revenue share program.

    "content": "<p>If you’re choosing between Fathom Realty and Keller Williams, the decision often hinges on what you value more: keeping every commission dollar or gaining access to passive income and world-class training. These two brokerages take very different approaches to supporting agents, and understanding those differences can help you make the right move for your career and financial goals.</p>\n<p>In this comparison, we’ll break down the real numbers and benefits behind Fathom and KW—from fees and income potential to support and satisfaction—so you can clearly see which model aligns best with how you want to build your business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Keller Williams</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is known for its clean, no-split commission model. Agents keep 100% of their commissions without paying any franchise or royalty fees. Costs are minimal, with transaction fees ranging from $165 to $465 depending on your plan and an annual fee of $700. There’s no production cap, which simplifies the process for high-volume agents, and there are no performance-based bonuses either—just predictable, transparent income with no surprises.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams takes a more traditional approach. Most agents start on a 70/30 split, although high producers may reach 100% after hitting a production cap, which typically ranges from $21,000 to $30,000 depending on the office. A 6% franchise fee applies until the cap is reached, and monthly desk fees vary by location. On top of that, E&#038;O insurance can cost between $122 and $350 per month, depending on the region. These ongoing fees can take a significant bite out of commissions, especially for newer agents still working to gain traction.</p>\n<p>While Fathom focuses on simplicity and agent take-home pay, Keller Williams offers more resources—but at a higher cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty keeps it simple—what you earn is what you sell. There’s no revenue share, no retirement income program, and no willable income. For agents who are focused solely on commission income and aren’t concerned with building long-term residual streams, this model may be sufficient. But for those looking to scale their business or build wealth beyond closings, the lack of secondary income paths can be limiting.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams offers agents a revenue share program that pays agents for attracting others to the company. While this program requires time and relationship-building to yield results, it can be a powerful source of passive income over time. In addition, KW offers a retirement income path that provides more financial stability as agents move into later stages of their career. For agents who value multiple income streams and are open to mentorship and leadership, Keller Williams provides more long-term financial upside than Fathom.</p>\n<p>That said, KW’s income opportunities come with a cost. Participation in the revenue share program doesn&#8217;t reduce your office expenses or splits, so the benefits depend on how much you recruit and how well your team performs.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers no formal training programs or live coaching. There’s no onboarding process for new agents and no 24/7 support. While experienced agents who already have systems in place might not miss the structure, newer agents or those switching markets often find the lack of training to be a challenge. This hands-off approach works for self-starters but can leave others feeling stranded.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams, in contrast, has built its reputation around agent training. Many agents consider KW’s education programs to be among the best in the industry. Through in-office mentorship, structured training events, and the Keller Williams University platform, agents have access to development at every level of their career. However, many of these courses come with a price tag, ranging from $299 to as high as $2,500 depending on the program. KW doesn’t offer 24/7 support either, but the structured environment and access to local leaders often help bridge that gap.</p>\n<p>For agents who learn best through direct instruction, consistent coaching, and a team environment, Keller Williams has the upper hand. But for those who want low fees and already know what they’re doing, Fathom keeps things lean and cost-effective.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty’s tech stack includes basic tools for transaction management and some marketing functionality. It’s designed to help agents complete the essentials, but it lacks advanced features like predictive analytics, AI lead follow-up, or customizable CRMs. Agents looking for more robust systems will need to invest in their own tools or work with third-party services.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams has invested heavily in its proprietary technology platform. Agents have access to command centers for lead tracking, client management, and marketing automation, as well as an integrated CRM. These tools are designed to streamline an agent’s workflow and create a scalable business, especially in busy markets. The level of tech at KW can be a significant advantage for agents juggling high volumes or running teams. However, some agents find the tools overwhelming or underutilized, and as with everything at KW, the cost must be weighed against the benefit.</p>\n<p>Agents who value built-in tech will find more at Keller Williams, but those who prefer to control their own systems—or save money—may feel more at home with Fathom.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty maintains a strong Glassdoor rating of 4.6 out of 5. Agents often cite the commission structure and low fees as the biggest advantages, especially for independent-minded professionals. However, the most common critique is the lack of mentorship and growth support, which can become a sticking point for agents looking to scale or refine their skills.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams has a 4.3 rating, with thousands of reviews highlighting the quality of training and culture of collaboration. Many agents appreciate the opportunities to grow, learn, and earn through revenue share. At the same time, some reviews mention frustration with high fees and inconsistent experiences depending on office leadership. Franchise offices vary widely, so an agent’s satisfaction often depends on the specific KW office they join.</p>\n<p>The most satisfied agents today are those who feel both empowered and supported. For some, that means lower fees and autonomy. For others, it means paying more but gaining access to live mentorship, business tools, and income diversification.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Keller Williams</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a smart choice for agents who want maximum take-home pay and a no-frills model. If you’re confident in your skills, have your own tools in place, and don’t need mentorship or extra training, Fathom offers financial freedom with minimal overhead. But if you’re looking to build a long-term business, the lack of revenue share, training, or support may start to feel restrictive.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams, meanwhile, offers a broader ecosystem of income opportunities, education, and proprietary tools. It’s an excellent fit for agents who value training, want to participate in revenue share, and are focused on building wealth over time. The trade-off is higher fees and a more corporate structure—but for many agents, that structure provides exactly the support they need to grow.</p>\n<p>Of course, if neither of these models feels like the right fit, there’s a third path that combines the best of both.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 1000w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 300w, https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7e31c55907b774e2-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/mobile 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

There is no franchise or royalty fee, which helps agents retain a larger portion of their earnings. LPT Realty has a production cap of $15K, and once agents hit the cap, they keep 100% of their commissions. Monthly fees range from $0 to $149 per month, depending on the agent&#8217;s chosen plan. Transaction fees are $195 before the cap is reached, providing predictability in costs.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers commission splits between 60/40 and 80/20. While this is competitive, it may not be as appealing to agents seeking higher earnings. The franchise fee is set at 6%, and there is no production cap, meaning agents will continue paying franchise fees regardless of their production level. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the royalty structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers additional income opportunities beyond commissions, including a revenue share program. This allows agents to build a team and earn passive income, enhancing their long-term financial stability. LPT Realty also provides retirement income and willable income paths, giving agents more control over their future.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens does not offer revenue share, retirement income, or willable income paths. Agents working at Better Homes &#038; Gardens are limited to commission-based income, which may not provide the same level of long-term financial security as LPT Realty’s additional income streams.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides no formal training but offers 24/7 agent support, which is beneficial for agents who value immediate assistance. This support is particularly helpful for agents who need help with transactions or business development outside regular business hours.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers training that varies by office, so the level of education and support may depend on location. However, it does not provide 24/7 support, which could be a limitation for agents needing real-time help.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides agents with modern technology tools, including CRM systems and marketing platforms, to help streamline their work and boost productivity. The brokerage focuses on using tech to support agents in growing their business and staying competitive in the market.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens also offers technological resources, particularly marketing tools, but the level of available technology support varies by office. Agents working in locations with fewer resources may find that they lack access to the most up-to-date technology, which could impact their ability to compete effectively in their markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 37 reviews. Agents appreciate the transparent fee structure and the additional income opportunities provided by the brokerage.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 256 reviews. While agents highlight the strong brand reputation and marketing support, they often express concerns over the higher franchise fees and the absence of revenue-sharing or retirement benefits.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-better-homes-gardens\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Better Homes &#038; Gardens</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out for its favorable commission splits, lower fees, and multiple income streams, making it an excellent choice for agents looking to maximize their earnings and build long-term wealth. The 24/7 agent support and modern technology offerings also provide a more flexible and agent-friendly experience.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens is a well-known and reputable brand, which can be beneficial for agents looking to leverage brand recognition in their marketing. However, the lack of additional income opportunities and ongoing franchise fees may limit the financial potential for agents focused on long-term growth.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.
