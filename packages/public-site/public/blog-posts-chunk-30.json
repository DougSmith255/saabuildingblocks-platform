Here are the essential steps to make your profiles pop and leave a memorable mark:</p>\n<h4 id=\"your-biography\">Your Biography</h4>\n<p>Picture your bio as the trailer to the <strong>blockbuster movie</strong> of your career. Start with the marquee: &#8220;Introducing [Your Name], the Realtor of [Your Locations]!&#8221; Now, sprinkle in the magic dust by telling readers what is your unique value proposition.</p>\n<p>What makes you different? Is it your lightning-fast responses, your encyclopedia-like knowledge of the local market, or your wizardry in closing deals that seem almost mythical?</p>\n<p>And because every hero is accessible, make sure your contact info is as clear and inviting as a welcome mat at a new listing. This isn&#8217;t just a bio; it&#8217;s the beginning of countless success stories, including yours.</p>\n<h4 id=\"professional-headshot\">Professional Headshot</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4610 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-6.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-6.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-6-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Elevate your profile with a professional headshot that says, <strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m the real deal.&#8221;</strong> This isn&#8217;t just a photo; it&#8217;s your declaration of quality, your visual handshake, and your first opportunity to say, &#8220;Yes, I understand the power of a great first impression.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ensure your visual introduction is as striking, confident, and polished as you are, proving without a doubt that when it comes to real estate, you mean serious business.</p>\n<h4 id=\"profile-banner\">Profile Banner</h4>\n<p>Amp up your profile&#8217;s <strong>wow factor</strong> with banners that scream professionalism and polish.

When someone drops a comment, asks a question, or slides into your DMs, it&#8217;s your cue to be the gracious host.</p>\n<p>Imagine each interaction as a chance to spin the conversation into a confetti of connections. Be the agent who shows up and shows off your knack for timely, meaningful chats. Swift responses say &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m the go-to agent who&#8217;s always on the ball!&#8221; So turn those notifications into not-to-miss opportunities, making every reply a step towards building relationships that last.</p>\n<h3 id=\"use-attention-grabbing-titles\">Use Attention-Grabbing Titles</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4609 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-7.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-7.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-7-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Step into the spotlight with titles that dance off the page and straight into the hearts of your audience.

You’ll also potentially charm a broader audience.

Plus, since many other agents aren’t in the know, this is your chance to gain some competitive ground.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ignoring-local-seo-practices\">1. Ignoring Local SEO Practices</h3>\n<p>Harnessing the power of local SEO with your real estate social media marketing unlocks a secret level where potential nearby clients are effortlessly guided to your content.</p>\n<p>Real estate agents who skip this game-changing strategy overlook the magic of adding location tags or sprinkling their posts with local keywords, rendering them invisible to the very people who are searching for their services.</p>\n<p>Local SEO illuminates the path for local homebuyers and sellers straight to your doorstep. Infuse your content with mentions of your city, the charming neighborhoods you serve, and iconic landmarks that resonate with the local community. This isn&#8217;t just about being found; it&#8217;s about being found by those who matter most to your business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"not-prioritizing-video-content-on-all-social-media-platforms\">2. Not Prioritizing Video Content on All Social Media Platforms</h3>\n<p>Using video content across all social media platforms is not just a recommendation; it&#8217;s a game changer for real estate social media marketing. Despite this, a surprising number of realtors still don’t prioritize video content.</p>\n<p>From virtual tours that let viewers walk through properties to describing your local living benefits, to live Q&#038;A sessions that foster real-time interaction, videos offer a dynamic way to showcase your expertise far beyond what static images can achieve.</p>\n<p>Videos also provide a unique opportunity for you to connect directly with your audience, making your social media presence more engaging, personal, and relatable. By prioritizing video content, you&#8217;re building relationships and trust, showing that you&#8217;re not just a realtor but a guide through the complex journey of buying or selling a home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inconsistent-branding-across-platforms\">3. Inconsistent Branding Across Platforms</h3>\n<p>Elevating your real estate social media marketing demands unwavering consistency in your branding across every platform. A common pitfall for real estate agents is using mismatched profiles that fragment their brand identity. This inconsistency can lead to confusion among potential clients, diluting the impact of your marketing efforts.</p>\n<p>To build a consistent brand your logo, color scheme, and core messaging must be aligned across all your social media accounts. Consistency in real estate social media marketing is not just about aesthetics; it&#8217;s about crafting a seamless, trustworthy brand experience that draws clients to you, time and time again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"neglecting-engagement-with-followers\">4. Neglecting Engagement With Followers</h3>\n<p>Mastering real estate social media marketing hinges significantly on engagement. Failure to actively engage can significantly diminish your online presence. Ignoring comments, messages, or not participating in conversations on your social media pages projects an image of disinterest or gives the impression that you&#8217;re too preoccupied to help new clients.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4608 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-6.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-6.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-6-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>The secret to thriving on social media lies in your responsiveness. Make it a priority to interact with your audience by replying to comments, addressing inquiries promptly, and sparking meaningful discussions on your page. This proactive engagement is more than just courtesy; it&#8217;s a powerful strategy to nurture relationships, build trust, and create a vibrant community around your brand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sharing-information-without-permission\">5. Sharing Information Without Permission</h3>\n<p>This should be obvious, but it’s worth stating. In real estate social media marketing, the cardinal rule is respecting client confidentiality. Sharing any personal information without explicit permission is not just a faux pas; it&#8217;s a breach of trust and professionalism.</p>\n<p>Always ensure that you have obtained clear consent before featuring client stories, photos, or any specifics about their property transactions on your social media channels. This safeguards your clients&#8217; privacy and underscores your integrity as a realtor. In real estate social media marketing, trust is your most valuable asset—handle it with care.</p>\n<h3 id=\"not-avoiding-overpromotion\">6. Overpromoting</h3>\n<p>In real estate social media marketing, striking the right balance between promotion and providing value is crucial. The temptation to continuously spotlight your listings or services can be strong, but it&#8217;s essential to remember that overpromotion can repel potential clients rather than attract them. To navigate this delicate balance, adopt a strategy where for every self-promotional post, you provide four content posts that deliver pure value with no sales pitch attached.</p>\n<p>This 4:1 ratio of value to promotion ensures that your social media presence enriches your audience&#8217;s knowledge rather than bombarding them with advertisements. Value-driven content can range from educational articles that demystify the buying or selling process, insightful analyses of current market trends, practical home improvement tips that homeowners can apply, to showcasing the unique aspects of the communities you serve.</p>\n<p>By following this thoughtful approach, you position yourself as a knowledgeable and reliable resource in the real estate domain and ensure that when you do share promotional content, your audience is more receptive, viewing you not just as a salesperson but as a valued advisor in their real estate journey.</p>\n<h3>7. Providing Quantity Over Quality</h3>\n<p>Adopting a quality-over-quantity approach in real estate social media marketing is essential. Flooding your followers&#8217; feeds with incessant posts can lead to annoyance and disengagement. Instead, focus on curating a selection of high-quality, impactful content.</p>\n<p>This strategy enhances the visibility and effectiveness of all your real estate content efforts. This approach respects the time and attention of your followers and elevates your brand&#8217;s perception, making every post count.</p>\n<h3>8. Not Listening and Adapting</h3>\n<p>The mantra &#8220;listen and adapt&#8221; is not just advice—it&#8217;s a strategy for success in real estate social media. Feedback from your audience is a goldmine of insights, yet it&#8217;s astonishing how often this treasure trove is overlooked. Pay close attention to how your followers engage with various types of content. Their reactions and interactions are a direct line to understanding what resonates most effectively with them.</p>\n<p>By tailoring your content to align with the preferences and interests of your audience, you&#8217;re demonstrating a commitment to meeting their needs and interests. Additionally, embracing this adaptive strategy of making your content more impactful ensures that your social media presence is not static but evolves with your audience, keeping your brand relevant and engaging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"paid-advertising-for-real-estate-social-media-marketing\">Paid Advertising for Real Estate Social Media Marketing</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4606\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"297\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5-300x89.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5-768x228.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>There’s a right way and a wrong way to use paid advertising for social media. The wrong way is just a waste of your money and your time. Here are the benefits of paid advertising. Make sure you use it in a manner to get every single advantage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"targeted-exposure\">Real Estate Precision Targeting</h3>\n<p>Navigating the vast ocean of social media platforms is akin to attending a vast, global gala. With paid advertising, realtors gain the ability to pinpoint their ideal audience amidst the crowd, a critical strategy in real estate social media marketing. Precision targeting in real estate social media marketing is like having a fishing net that only captures the specific fish you want.</p>\n<p>You can advertise to people based on their interests or geographic location. Whether it&#8217;s someone with a penchant for browsing homes online or a resident of New York, your ads reach those who genuinely matter to your business.</p>\n<h3>Cost Efficiency in Real Estate Marketing</h3>\n<p>In real estate social media marketing, the beauty of social media advertising lies in its affordability. You can control how much you spend, setting the bounds of your advertising budget within your means and nothing more.</p>\n<p>When your ad campaign exceeds expectations, you&#8217;re at liberty to up your investment and extend your real estate advertisement’s reach. This approach ensures that your marketing dollars are spent wisely, maximizing exposure while adhering to your financial comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Measurable Outcomes in Real Estate Social Media Marketing</h3>\n<p>When real estate agents invest in advertising, they need a clear understanding of return on investment. Luckily, social media platforms provide robust analytics tools, serving as a comprehensive dashboard for your marketing efforts.</p>\n<p>These analytics show invaluable insights into the performance of your ads making it clear which advertisements worked well and which were a bust. This data empowers real estate agents to refine their strategies, ensuring each dollar spent on social media advertising is most effective.</p>\n<h3>Boosted Engagement Through Real Estate Social Media Marketing</h3>\n<p>Social media ads in the real estate sector are far from static; they are interactive gateways that draw potential clients into a more immersive experience. Through real estate social media marketing, an advertisement can seamlessly transition viewers from casual observers to engaged prospects.</p>\n<p>Imagine you see an advertisement for a property that looks cool. With just a click, you can get a virtual tour, providing an immediate, in-depth look at the home. This immediate feedback enhances the user experience and significantly increases the likelihood of engagement, moving potential prospects one step closer to being your client.</p>\n<h3>A Dirty Little Secret</h3>\n<p>Though we can’t confirm this, it&#8217;s a logical assumption that social media platforms tend to favor content creators who invest in advertising. Given the underlying profit-driven motives of these platforms, they might prioritize or enhance the visibility of content from paying advertisers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap!</h2>\n<p>In wrapping up, real estate social media marketing is like unlocking a treasure trove of opportunities.

Maybe No More “Free” Real Estate Agents</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5611\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-6.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"321\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-6.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-6-300x96.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-6-768x247.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Real estate industry changes could flip the script on how real estate agents are paid, potentially ending the era of &#8220;free&#8221; agents who only get paid upon closing a deal.</p>\n<p>After all, real estate agents invest heavily in their profession.  They pay huge splits of their earned commissions to their brokerages and their referral partners.  They pay extensive expenses to professional associations, for ongoing education, and for regular business expenses (like car expenses, transaction coordinators, editors, and the like).  Agents pay to advertise for new customers, and it costs agents plenty of money and time to get repeat customer business too.</p>\n<p>Agents pay all these expenses while putting in weeks, months, and sometimes years for their clients, all without any guaranteed pay. If a house doesn’t sell or a homebuyer changes their mind, agents get no money for their sacrifices.  What other profession does this?</p>\n<p>Considering agent risk and real estate industry changes, this unique real estate business model could be reevaluated.  Maybe agents in the future will be paid more like other professions that don’t provide more than one free consultation before remuneration for services rendered is due.</p>\n<p>Real estate clients might start to need to pay agents for their time and advice regardless of a home purchase or home sale.  That result would recognize the extensive professional services real estate agents offer to homebuyers and home sellers throughout the transaction process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-maybe-higher-listing-commissions\">3. Maybe Higher Listing Commissions</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5612\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-4.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"416\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-4-300x125.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-4-768x319.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Picture this: with all these legal tweaks happening in the real estate world to cut down on commission costs, guess what might happen? Listing agents could end up raking in higher commissions. Yep, you heard that right! Without the usual army of buyer agents showing off properties left and right, listing agents might have to step up to the plate and do more property tours themselves.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker: only licensed agents can legally show homes. So, listing agents might find themselves juggling a whole lot more, which could totally justify bumping up their commission payment rates. It&#8217;s like trying to cut down on one expense, only to find yourself shelling out more in the long run. Who would&#8217;ve thought, right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-maybe-traditional-brokerages-fail\">4.

With estimated damages expected to be over $5 billion and no end in sight, brace yourselves for a brokerage crisis hitting just when brokerages are already struggling with a lot fewer real estate transactions.</p>\n<p>In this new world, agents better strap in for less success too thanks to DIY homebuyers and potentially shrinking commissions. And as for traditional brokerages? Already losing 100s of millions of dollars, they might raise agent fees or they just may go bankrupt.</p>\n<p>The future of real estate agents lies in moving to financially resilient brokerage models, like the cloud-based platform offered by <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-explained-in-9-minutes/\">eXp Realty</a>. Renowned as the only profitable independent brokerage in 2022 and hailed as the fastest-growing brokerage globally, eXp Realty will survive the crisis and its agents will continue to thrive.</p>\n<p>Echoing this sentiment, <a href=\"https://www.mikedp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike DelPrete</a>, a prominent global real estate tech strategist, asserts that &#8220;clarity is emerging on the shifting brokerage landscape,&#8221; and traditional brokerages are already witnessing an exodus of agents seeking refuge in more lucrative and streamlined models like eXp Realty.</p>\n<p>So, buckle up! The future of real estate is changing, and those who hitch their wagon to innovative models like eXp Realty are set to ride the wave of success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-maybe-not-enough-buyer-agents\">5.

That new agent need may scare off part-timers or hobbyists from sticking around. And, if compensation takes a nosedive, thanks to those ongoing battles, more agents might pack up and leave for greener pastures.</p>\n<p>But hold onto your hats, because things could get even crazier! Analysts predict that lower fees could send up to 80 percent of buyer agents running for the hills. Imagine a world with a shortage of this many agents, leaving home buyers to fend for themselves in the wilderness of the internet.</p>\n<p>Without buyer agents to steer them right, even homebuyers who want a buyer agent might find themselves either unable to secure one or, ironically, the cost of buyer agents could rise and more homebuyers may be priced out. In those cases, homebuyers will need to rely more on the internet and a potential sea of misinformation all while risking their investments on shaky ground.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-no-effect-to-industry-costs\">6.

It&#8217;s a game of give and take.

With their slick websites and legal jargon, these online listers are not exactly playing by the same rules as your local buyer agent.</p>\n<p>See, buyer agents have a sworn duty to always put their clients first, but these online listing companies, not so much. Sure, those online platforms might seem like a dream with their easy browsing and quick info, but homebuyers beware! You’ll need to really dig into the fine print.</p>\n<p>Failure to do so could leave homebuyers vulnerable to unforeseen challenges or disadvantages that may arise from an online property listing company&#8217;s focus on protecting its own interests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-off-market-property-broker-dominance\">8.

These secret listings are like hidden treasures, only accessible if you&#8217;ve got a buyer agent in your corner.</p>\n<p>But hold on a second! While Off-Market properties might sound cool, they come with a catch. With fewer options on the table, buyers might feel like they&#8217;re shopping in a tiny pond instead of a big ocean. Plus, the whole secret deal thing? It&#8217;s not exactly reassuring for homebuyers who want transparency.</p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s the kicker: relying too much on Off-Market listings could throw us all right back in the old days when you had to cozy up to a real estate agent just to find out what was for sale. Talk about taking a step backward in the quest for a fair and open market!</p>\n<h2 id=\"9-some-buyer-agents-may-be-unpaid-for-services-rendered\">9.

In the meantime, some MLS listings are already showing zero as the amount offered to the buyer agent.</p>\n<p>This potential shift poses a significant challenge, particularly for agents who are not adequately prepared for such a change. Those without a buyer representation contract could be left empty-handed even after already dedicating loads of time and money working for a client.</p>\n<p>Read our other topical blogs, particularly “Buyer Agents Must Act Now &#8211; Sellers No Longer to Pay Buyer Agents” to navigate this new changing real estate landscape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10-more-far-reaching-consequences-than-anticipated\">10.

But if the commission game changes or transactions take a hit, these teams might find themselves on shaky ground. Cue the dramatic music—job losses and less support for homebuyers could be on the horizon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"online-data-providers\">Online Data Providers</h3>\n<p>Think of Zillow and Realtor.com as the Google Maps of house hunting. They thrive on a bustling army of buyer agents laying out cash to buy leads.  But if brokerages start shrinking or shutting their doors, and agents thin out, these platforms might find themselves in a bit of a pickle. Fewer agents mean fewer customers, and that spells trouble for their bottom line.</p>\n<h3 id=\"small-lenders\">Small Lenders</h3>\n<p>Lenders, who traditionally partner with real estate agents to offer financing options to homebuyers, could also be impacted. If the real estate buyer agent scene starts to sputter, they could feel the pinch too. Less agent action means fewer referrals, leaving these small lenders high and dry. Imagine the domino effect: less competition for mortgage originators means a less competitive mortgage market, which could mean steeper costs for homebuyers to nab a loan.</p>\n<p>So, as you can see, the real estate drama isn&#8217;t just confined to the agents and brokers—it&#8217;s a whole tangled web of connections that could lead to some serious plot twists in the market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, real estate agents are about to embark on an epic adventure filled with twists, turns, and plot twists galore! With legal battles raging and industry norms shifting, it&#8217;s time to brace yourselves for some serious action.</p>\n<p>But fear not, fellow agents, for amid chaos lies opportunity!

In other words, learn to clarify your value!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How do real estate agents typically receive their payments?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Traditionally, a home transaction closing triggers the payment to agents.  The closing statement accounts for the commission payment as part of its details.  After the close, the escrow officer sends the commission to each agent&#8217;s broker &#8211; who then disburses it to the agents after deducting for their fees (splits).</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average income for a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. However, location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full-time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average real estate agent commission charge?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Typically, the buying and selling agents equally share the average US commission, which is generally 5% to 6% of a property’s total sale price.  These numbers vary between locations, different agents, and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Does an agent&#8217;s brokerage pay the entire commission to the agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Most likely, no. That’s because most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Can I negotiate my realtor’s commission rate?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. Therefore, you should discuss the commission before signing any agreement</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">However, note that some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">When do real estate agents receive their commission?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Agents receive their commissions upon the closing of deals. Therefore, they do not receive any payment for their time or expenses until after the deals close. You might say that real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency. Lawyers who work on contingency are also paid upon the completion of successful court cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How much do real estate agents make if the house doesn’t sell?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Generally, nothing. The agent is not compensated for their time or their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Do brokerages pay real estate agents a monthly salary?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals. Instead, agents earn their pay when they successfully close a deal.  However, some brokers pay agents a salary, but not generally.</p>\n",

Yes, the real estate business is hitting a major shift, but it’s our golden ticket to clear up some big public misconceptions.</p>\n<p>For example, the general public does not understand that most real estate agents are not paid anything for the time and expenses that they devote to clients &#8211; time that can run days, weeks, months, and years and expenses that are in the 4-figure range.</p>\n<p>Agents are not paid by their brokerages, as the public seems to presume, for their time or expenses.  Instead, agents earn nothing if a deal doesn’t close.</p>\n<p>In our buyer presentations, let’s take the opportunity to explain the realities of our risky profession. After all, what other job has someone hustling non-stop, shelling out their own cash, with absolutely no promise of a paycheck?</p>\n<p>Here’s the only one I can think of &#8211; lawyers working on contingency.  Lawyers working on contingency cases don&#8217;t see a cent unless they win damages in a case. But when those contingency lawyers win a case, they pull in way more than their usual fees. That&#8217;s their gamble paying off – a fat paycheck for the win, balancing out the gigs that don’t pay off anything at all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-a-contingency-higher-risk-job\">It’s a Contingency Higher-Risk Job</h3>\n<p>And hey, us real estate agents? We’re in the same boat. We’re out there, investing time and money, not knowing if it&#8217;ll ever pay off. But when it does, we&#8217;re talking about a payday that currently makes it worth our risk.</p>\n<p>But let’s face it. The general public loves that agents work for free UNLESS their home transaction closes. And yet now the public also wants to lower buyer agent commission which does not account for the risks we all take.  Basically, the general public wants to have their cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p>Armed with the comforting knowledge that professions that take on more risk are better paid when their risk pays off, it’s time for buyer agents to set the record straight.  In buyer presentations and the next time someone tells you real estate agents are overpaid, break it down for them.</p>\n<p>Agents aren’t just throwing out their cash and clocking in hours, weeks, and months for kicks and fun. Real estate agents take on significant risks and the only way to make it worth our while is by ensuring the pot at the end of the rainbow reflects that added risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exploring-future-innovative-compensation-structures\">Exploring Future Innovative Compensation Structures</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5628\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/76357.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"365\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/76357.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/76357-300x110.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/76357-768x280.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Okay, so we&#8217;ve laid it all out about the gamble agents take. But what if people out there still think agents are paid too much?  In that case, it&#8217;s prime time for us agents to shake things up. Our buyer presentations are our golden ticket to rethink and maybe even reinvent how we get paid.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re talking about fine-tuning our fees so they&#8217;re spot-on with the real deal we bring to the table, making sure it&#8217;s a win-win for us and the homebuyers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all about getting that balance just right, where what we charge is a clear reflection of our worth and the peace of mind we provide to our clients. Here are some ideas of how agents might reinvent their career compensation:</p>\n<h3 id=\"pick-your-package-with-tiered-service-models\">Pick-Your-Package with Tiered Service Models</h3>\n<p>Think about giving power to clients while protecting your right to earn compensation by providing a snazzy tiered service lineup. Clients would get to pick from a variety of service bundles you create with each bundle being packed with its own unique features and priced just right.</p>\n<p>Clients could match what they need (and what they want to spend) with the services you rock at. And you? You get to tailor your compensation to the real sweat, skill, and savvy you pour into service. It&#8217;s all about flexibility, choice, and making sure everyone&#8217;s getting the value they deserve.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flat-fee-services-with-one-price-wonders\">Flat Fee Services with One-Price Wonders</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5629 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2323.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2323.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2323-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Here clients can dive into the world of clear-cut, no-surprises pricing with a fabulous menu of flat-fee services! This is where simplicity meets satisfaction, perfect for clients who love sticking to their budget and adore the peace of mind that comes with upfront pricing.</p>\n<p>Lay out your services buffet-style, letting clients pick what they crave, all at a fixed, transparent price. It&#8217;s your ticket to setting crystal-clear expectations and spicing up your offerings, all while drawing in a diverse crowd who’s all about value, clarity, and straightforward real estate magic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"time-is-money-literally-with-hourly-compensation\">Time is Money, Literally, With Hourly Compensation</h3>\n<p>Shifting gears to an hourly compensation model could totally revolutionize the real estate game. Think about it – getting paid for every hour you pour your heart and expertise into, especially when navigating those high-maintenance or intricate deals.</p>\n<p>It’s the ultimate transparency move, putting a clear price tag on your invaluable time and smarts. However, brace yourself – we’re in for a marathon, not a sprint. Convincing homebuyers, who are traditionally used to the freebie service until closing day, to start paying by the hour?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s going to be an uphill battle. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen, so consider the ways you might move the idea along.</p>\n<h3 id=\"incentives-unleashed-performance-pays-off-with-performance-based-packages\">Incentives Unleashed: Performance Pays Off with Performance–Based Packages</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5630 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/333333.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/333333.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/333333-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Imagine compensation packages tailored to reward your hard work and exceptional outcomes. We’re talking about a setup where your commitment and success in navigating intricate, demanding transactions directly boost your earnings.</p>\n<p>You start with a baseline fee, but here’s the kicker – your client rewards you extra for hitting those key performance milestones that matter most to them.</p>\n<p>This setup not only aligns your buyer agent commission with your achievements but also ensures clients receive top-notch service, knowing their investment translates directly into value. It’s a win-win where your skill and success directly influence your compensation, guaranteeing that both you and your clients come out ahead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exploring-new-horizons-in-compensation-strategies\">Exploring New Horizons in Compensation Strategies</h3>\n<p>This list of possible compensation structures is only the beginning.  The landscape of buyer agent compensation is ripe for innovation, presenting a kaleidoscope of cool, innovative buyer agent commission models that could totally reshape agent fees in the future.</p>\n<p>Embrace the opportunity to be the architect of your agent income by designing a reward system that’s as satisfying and innovative as snagging the perfect property for your client!</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-back-to-real-estate-agent-basics\">Getting Back to Real Estate Agent Basics</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5631\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/444444.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"367\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/444444.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/444444-300x110.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/444444-768x282.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Defending why agents are paid well and considering new compensation structures is paramount but there’s more.</p>\n<p>In the new real estate industry world where buyer agents will likely do buyer presentations to explain agent value, they will also need to get back to the basics to compete with other agents.  Agents need to reinforce their foundational skills and strategies. Here’s how agents can strengthen their core practices to remain successful and resilient:</p>\n<h3 id=\"enhance-online-presence\">Enhance Online Presence</h3>\n<p>In today’s digital era, having a strong online presence is indispensable. This means not only maintaining an updated, user-friendly website but also being active and engaging on social media platforms, real estate forums, and online communities.</p>\n<p>Your online profiles should showcase your expertise, highlight positive client testimonials, and provide valuable content that resonates with potential buyers.  Not sure how to up your social media game?

Therefore, the seller often covers this fee, but industry changes could shake this up</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-was-the-impact-of-a-landmark-court-loss-on-buyer-agent-commissions\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What was the impact of a landmark court loss on buyer agent commissions?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\"><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/law-and-ethics/breaking-down-sitzer-burnett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This court case</a> was a game-changer, putting pressure on traditional commission structures and potentially reducing how much buyer agents pocket from home sales.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-department-of-justice-doj-statement-affect-buyer-agents\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How does the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-02/420087.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Justice (DOJ) statement</a> affect buyer agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The DOJ&#8217;s aims to make real estate transactions more transparent. Buyer agents will need to adapt to clearer commission disclosures and possibly tighter competition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-do-to-prepare-for-industry-changes-as-a-buyer-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What should buyer agents do to prepare for industry changes?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Stay informed and flexible. Brush up your Buyer Presentation skills. Embrace technology, enhance your negotiation skills, and consider diversifying your services. The goal? To stay valuable no matter how the market shifts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-unintended-consequences-of-payment-shifts-in-real-estate\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What are some unintended consequences of payment shifts in real estate?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Shifts towards buyer-paid commissions could lead buyers to bargain harder or skip out on using an agent altogether. That is, it’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. In other words, learn to clarify your value!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How do real estate agents typically receive their payments?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Traditionally, a home transaction closing triggers the payment to agents.  The closing statement accounts for the commission payment as part of its details.  After the close, the escrow officer sends the commission to each agent&#8217;s broker &#8211; who then disburses it to the agents after deducting for their fees (splits).</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average income for a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. However, location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full-time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average real estate agent commission charge?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Typically, the buying and selling agents equally share the average US commission, which is generally 5% to 6% of a property’s total sale price.  These numbers vary between locations, different agents, and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Does an agent&#8217;s brokerage pay the entire commission to the agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Most likely, no. That’s because most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Can I negotiate my realtor’s commission rate?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. Therefore, you should discuss the commission before signing any agreement</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">However, note that some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">When do real estate agents receive their commission?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Agents receive their commissions upon the closing of deals. Therefore, they do not receive any payment for their time or expenses until after the deals close. You might say that real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency. Lawyers who work on contingency are also paid upon the completion of successful court cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How much do real estate agents make if the house doesn’t sell?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Generally, nothing. The agent is not compensated for their time or their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Do brokerages pay real estate agents a salary monthly?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals. Instead, agents earn their pay when they successfully close a deal.  However, some brokers pay agents a salary, but not generally.</p>\n",

That trial resulted in a multi-billion dollar verdict against the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and other brokerage players.  As a result, copycat cases began popping up across the country.</p>\n<p>Significantly, and recently, the Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a “Statement of Interest” in another case which, if adopted by the court, would prevent home sellers from making any offer of compensation to the brokers of buyer agents.</p>\n<p>Moreover, on March 15, 2024, the National Association of Realtors submitted it&#8217;s proposed settlement in the Sitzer/Burnett trial which agrees with the position of the DOJ. Thus, now it is all but certain, that soon home sellers will no longer be allowed to offer buyer agent broker compensation in the MLS co-broker offer field. However, home sellers will be allowed to make concessions for closing costs in the MLS. The final settlement is subject to court approval.</p>\n<p>As court cases unfold and the final settlement is determined, real estate professionals, particularly buyer agents will likely need to adapt to a new standard.  That is, buyer agents&#8217; compensation will no longer be offered by sellers via the field on the MLS listing.  Instead, buyer agents&#8217; compensation will result from direct agreements with homebuying clients.  As a result, this change will mark a pivotal evolution in how buyer agents are paid.</p>\n<h2 id=\"outcomes-for-real-estate-buyer-agents\">Outcomes for Real Estate Buyer Agents</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5606\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-5.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"390\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-5.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-5-300x117.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-5-768x300.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Additionally, if you read our blog “<strong>5 Outcomes for the Future of Real Estate Buyer Agents”, </strong>you also know that the role of buyer agents is far from becoming obsolete. That&#8217;s because buyer agent expertise, personalized service, and negotiation skills remain crucial, especially because buying a home is often the most significant financial decision in a person&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>Further, over the last decade, there have been plenty of companies trying to “disrupt” the business of real estate agents and most have failed entirely. Instead, buyer agents continue to offer invaluable support, local knowledge, and the avoidance of homebuyer risk, proving that buyer agents are an enduring necessity in buying properties.</p>\n<p>However, due to the recent legal developments, it&#8217;s becoming clear that homebuyers will be more knowledgeable about the reality that, despite what many buyer agents have said, buyer agent fees have never been “free” &#8211; they have always been part of the home&#8217;s price, albeit indirectly.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it could become common homebuyer knowledge that buyer agents can generally offer rebates from their commission to the homebuyers as a credit at closing.  This process is complicated because the credit is subject to the approval of lenders and the buyer agent&#8217;s brokerage.</p>\n<p>But, if the complications are overcome, homebuyers can receive a portion of the buyer agent’s commission as a credit on the closing statement. More importantly, homebuyers are going to come to know, that they can make a home purchase without hiring any buyer agents to represent them.</p>\n<p>This newly informed homebuyer will drive the need for buyer agents to clearly and effectively articulate their value. Why should a homebuyer use their services?</p>\n<p>Additionally, buyer agents will need to distinguish themselves from other buyer agents vying for the same client and also from the potential growing sentiment that homebuyers can manage their homebuying process without a buyer agent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-real-estate-buyer-agent-value\">Defining Real Estate Buyer Agent Value</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5607\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-5.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"387\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-5.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-5-300x116.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-5-768x297.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>What is the value of a buyer agent?

Therefore, the seller often covers this fee, but industry changes could shake this up</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-was-the-impact-of-a-landmark-court-loss-on-buyer-agent-commissions\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What was the impact of a landmark court loss on buyer agent commissions?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\"><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/law-and-ethics/breaking-down-sitzer-burnett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This court case</a> was a game-changer, putting pressure on traditional commission structures and potentially reducing how much buyer agents pocket from home sales.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-department-of-justice-doj-statement-affect-buyer-agents\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How does the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-02/420087.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Justice (DOJ) statement</a> affect buyer agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The DOJ&#8217;s aims to make real estate transactions more transparent. Buyer agents will need to adapt to clearer commission disclosures and possibly tighter competition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-do-to-prepare-for-industry-changes-as-a-buyer-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What should buyer agents do to prepare for industry changes?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Stay informed and flexible. Brush up your Buyer Presentation skills. Embrace technology, enhance your negotiation skills, and consider diversifying your services. The goal? To stay valuable no matter how the market shifts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-unintended-consequences-of-payment-shifts-in-real-estate\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What are some unintended consequences of payment shifts in real estate?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Shifts towards buyer-paid commissions could lead buyers to bargain harder or skip out on using an agent altogether. That is, it’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. In other words, learn to clarify your value!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How do real estate agents typically receive their payments?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Traditionally, a home transaction closing triggers the payment to agents.  The closing statement accounts for the commission payment as part of its details.  After the close, the escrow officer sends the commission to each agent&#8217;s broker &#8211; who then disburses it to the agents after deducting for their fees (splits).</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average income for a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. However, location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full-time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average real estate agent commission charge?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Typically, the buying and selling agents equally share the average US commission, which is generally 5% to 6% of a property’s total sale price.  These numbers vary between locations, different agents, and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Does an agent&#8217;s brokerage pay the entire commission to the agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Most likely, no. That’s because most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Can I negotiate my realtor’s commission rate?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. Therefore, you should discuss the commission before signing any agreement</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">However, note that some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">When do real estate agents receive their commission?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Agents receive their commissions upon the closing of deals. Therefore, they do not receive any payment for their time or expenses until after the deals close. You might say that real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency. In like fashion, lawyers who work on contingency are also paid upon the completion of successful court cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How much do real estate agents make if the house doesn’t sell?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Generally, nothing. The agent is not compensated for their time or their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Do brokerages pay real estate agents a salary monthly?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals. Instead, agents earn their pay when they successfully close a deal.  However, some brokers pay agents a salary, but not generally.</p>\n",

It includes things like your business name, logo, how your business looks, what you stand for, and the way you talk to people. In other words, the overall look of your business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"consistent-color-and-logo-for-memorable-real-estate-branding\">Consistent Color and Logo for Memorable Real Estate Branding</h3>\n<p>To properly brand your YouTube channel, everything about your channel, your pictures, banner, and thumbnails should look like they all come from the same place.</p>\n<h4 id=\"choosing-a-color-scheme-that-defines-who-you-are\">Choosing a Color Scheme that Defines Who You Are</h4>\n<p>A good way to do this is by using the <strong>same color scheme</strong> in your banner and thumbnails. By choosing specific colors for your channel banner and thumbnails, viewers will associate those colors with your brand. For example, if you always use blue and green, people will start to connect those colors with your channel.</p>\n<p>Choose your colors wisely. Different colors invoke different meanings and emotions. Search Google for the meaning of different colors to make that more in line with what your vibe is.</p>\n<h4 id=\"choosing-a-logo-for-real-estate\">Choosing a Logo for Your Channel</h4>\n<p>Using a <strong>consistent logo</strong> helps viewers recognize your content quickly. Think of it as putting your stamp on every video you make. It&#8217;s like when you see a red can with white letters, you know it&#8217;s Coca-Cola without even reading it.</p>\n<p>You can use your brokerage’s logo or your own.  If you use your own, make your logo in the same colors as your brand colors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"customizing-your-youtube-channel\">Customizing Your YouTube Channel</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4559\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-4.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"329\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-4-300x99.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-4-768x253.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you know what your branding will be, you can get started with personalizing your channel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uploading-a-professional-profile-picture\">Uploading a Professional Profile Picture</h3>\n<p>Adding professional headshots to your banner and your thumbnails makes things <strong>more personal</strong>. People get to see your face and get to know you.</p>\n<p>Your headshot should look professional but friendly. You want potential clients to feel like they can approach you with their questions or for help buying or selling their home.</p>\n<p>Be sure to place your photo with a background of one or more of your branding colors. That’s to keep everything consistent. If you want to add the color yourself, head on over to canva.com where you can remove the background of any headshot and replace it with your branded colors.</p>\n<p>When complete, add your photo by selecting “Customization”, and then “Branding”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-professions-channel-banner-for-your-real-estate-channel\">Creating a Professions Channel Banner for Your Real Estate Channel</h3>\n<p>Also in the “Branding” tab is where you add your channel banner. Channel banners are important because they’re one of the first things someone sees when they go to your page. Create a banner that is customized to your brand. Again, use Canva to make your banner.</p>\n<p>Canva has pre-made templates that make it easy to create your own with your branded colors.  If you’re not sure what these banners generally look like, do a search of all the banners done by realtors in your local market or beyond.</p>\n<p>Keep your banner clean and uncluttered looking.  Clutter overwhelms viewers and they are unlikely to read everything on a banner with too much information.</p>\n<p>Once you have an idea of the general look you prefer, add the needed information &#8211; name, contact, what you do, and your real estate salesperson license number.  If you don’t feel up to the task of creating your own banner, hire someone on <strong>Fiverr.com to do it for you.</strong></p>\n<p>Once done, add your banner to YouTube by again selecting “Customization” and then the “Branding” tab.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crafting-an-effective-channel-description-for-your-real-estate-channel\">Crafting an Effective Channel Description for Your Real Estate Channel</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4566 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dezgergerg.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dezgergerg.webp 426w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dezgergerg-300x201.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" /></p>\n<p>Still in “Customization”, move over to the “Basic Info” tab to write your channel description. Your description should be at least 250 words long and have the most important information in the first 100-150 words.</p>\n<p>Here, you’ll tell viewers who you are and what you do. Fill in this part with your contact information, services offered, and <strong>what makes you different from other realtor.</strong> Keep it simple but informative.</p>\n<p>Also, consistency matters! Your description can be the same one on your website, Facebook page, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"looking-your-best-with-more-elements\">Looking Your Best With More YouTube Elements</h3>\n<p>Again, still in “Customization”, go to the “Layout” tab. Here, you’ll want to add a channel trailer and choose featured sections.</p>\n<h4 id=\"upload-a-channel-trailer\"><strong>Upload a Channel Trailer</strong></h4>\n<p>When people come to your page, this is usually the first video they will see and it is super important. Think of it like a <strong>mini-ad</strong> for what you do.</p>\n<p>Your channel trailer should inform viewers about who you are, what your business is about, and what they&#8217;ll get from watching your videos. Since it&#8217;s the first thing they see, make it good! Good lighting, good sound!</p>\n<h4 id=\"create-video-playlists\">Create Video Playlists</h4>\n<p>You’ll want to create video playlists for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, playlists allow you to organize your channel’s content by topic.  You may have one playlist for property tours, another for tips about living in your town, and still another for home buyer or home seller tips.  Playlists help keep your channel tidy and user-friendly. Viewers appreciate being able to find exactly what they need without hassle.</p>\n<p>Second, playlists allow you to create more featured sections which helps the overall appearance of your channel, especially when just starting.  We’ll discuss more about featured sections next.  But first, here’s how to create a playlist.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to have already made a video.  When you upload that video, you’ll add the video details (here’s where your video description goes).  Below that you’ll see “Playlists”.  Hit the drop-down and choose “New Playlist” and add a name for that playlist.  That name will become part of the drop-down menu from there on out when you upload new videos.</p>\n<h4 id=\"add-featured-sections\">Add Featured Sections</h4>\n<p>Now that you’ve created playlists, you’ll want to create featured sections. Caution &#8211; if you don’t choose featured sections, when viewers first come to your page, YouTube only displays one row of your videos.  That will make it look like your channel has barely any content which may discourage some viewers from subscribing to your channel.</p>\n<p>Thus, you’ll want to add featured sections to your channel as soon as you start your channel – even if you have less than 6 videos.  To do that go back to the “Customization”, “Layout” tab and choose featured sections.</p>\n<p>Having the featured sections will fill up your channel page, even repeating some videos when you choose a section of “Popular Videos” as well as the same videos being in single playlists.</p>\n<p>The bottom line &#8211; this will help your new channel appear to have more content than it really has.  That’s all good when first starting your channel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maximizing-visibility-for-your-real-estate-youtube-channel\">Maximizing Visibility for Your Real Estate YouTube Channel</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4560\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-3.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"391\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-3.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-3-300x117.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-3-768x300.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"harnessing-the-power-of-keyword-research\">Harnessing the Power of Keyword Research</h3>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve customized your channel, it&#8217;s time to dig into the nitty-gritty of keyword research. Diving into keyword research is a <strong>pivotal step</strong> in ensuring your channel doesn&#8217;t just exist but thrives and reaches the right viewers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"discover-whats-trending\"><strong>Discover What&#8217;s Trending</strong></h4>\n<p>Keyword research is all about understanding what potential buyers or sellers in your area are actively searching for online. You want to discover what they are searching for and then make video content about that.</p>\n<p>There are several free tools you can use to uncover the search volume of specific terms. Try “Keywords Everywhere” or Google Trends.  Plug in a phrase you think might work and you’ll see the association search volume for that keyword.</p>\n<p>A high search volume indicates a term&#8217;s popularity. For example, identifying that &#8220;homes for sale in [Your Area]&#8221; is a frequently searched term can steer you toward creating highly relevant content.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-magic-of-long-tail-keywords\"><strong>The Magic of Long-Tail Keywords</strong></h4>\n<p>Incorporating long-tail keywords into your strategy is a game-changer. These phrases are longer and more detailed than others.  But long-tail keywords can work great.  For one, they often signal that someone is nearing a decision point. And, for two, long tail keywords face less competition but carry a high conversion potential.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of targeting “Homes for Sale in Marin”, use a long-tail keyword that targets &#8220;affordable family homes near Redwood High School&#8221; – much more specific. Doing a long tail keyword like that can directly connect you with audiences with specific living preferences that will lead that person right to your content.</p>\n<h4 id=\"embrace-local-insights\"><strong>Embrace Local Insights</strong></h4>\n<p>Incorporating local landmarks or neighborhoods into your keywords and video titles can <strong>significantly impact your content&#8217;s discoverability.</strong> Searchers often use these local pointers to find properties within specific areas of interest.</p>\n<p>Crafting videos titled “Best Family Neighborhoods Near [Landmark]” or “Why Live In [Neighborhood]” helps SEO (Search Engine Optimization) find your content. It also cements your reputation as the go-to local real estate authority in those locations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leveraging-seo-for-real-estate-on-youtube\"><strong>Leveraging SEO for on YouTube</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4562 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-5.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-5.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-5-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Understanding the art of keyword selection is just the beginning of enabling your audience to find your videos. Now, let&#8217;s delve into strategic placement to further enhance the visibility of your videos.</p>\n<h4 id=\"crafting-search-friendly-video-titles\"><strong>Crafting Search-Friendly Video Titles</strong></h4>\n<p>The title of your videos is searchable on Google and YouTube so the chosen title is the first chance to put your video in front of potential viewers. Incorporating precise, targeted keywords within your titles is key to ensuring your videos appear in search results.</p>\n<p>For instance, if your focus is on the Los Angeles market, a title like “Discover the Top 5 Los Angeles Homes for Sale | 2024 Insider’s Guide” not only captures attention with specific keywords such as “homes for sale” and “Los Angeles” but also appeals to those actively searching for real estate opportunities in that area.</p>\n<h3><strong>Designing Captivating Thumbnails with Engaging Hooks</strong></h3>\n<p>Thumbnails, those little rectangular images that are used as a video preview, help attract people to choose your video over others with the same topic. It&#8217;s essential to craft thumbnails that complement but don’t duplicate your title. Creating both a keyword title and a thumbnail that is different than your title gives you two shots to attract a viewer.</p>\n<p>Note, that because video titles are searchable, be sure to use your keywords there. Thumbnail words are not yet searchable as they are images only. So, use your thumbnail to intrigue and promise value.</p>\n<p>But don’t go so far in your thumbnail design as resorting to clickbait which uses exaggerations that ultimately disappoint viewers.  Clickbait will eventually harm a channel’s success. Instead, on your thumbnail, highlight an intriguing fact or feature from your video that is both truthful and enticing.</p>\n<h3><strong>Enhancing Video Descriptions and Utilizing Tags</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4561 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-4.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-4.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-4-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>The description of your video is another valuable space to provide further insight into your content and embed relevant keywords to increase your video’s searchable reach.</p>\n<p>But do more here. Include links to your professional website, contact details, and any free value you offer &#8211; like buyer and seller guides. This helps convert viewers into potential leads.</p>\n<p>Additionally, add tags wisely to align your videos’ topics with what your target audience would search to find your video. When you read your tags, it should be crystal clear what your video is about.</p>\n<p>Additionally, add timestamps to your video so viewers can get to the information they most seek elevating the quality of your content for them and encouraging them to come back for more.</p>\n<p>For example, if your video is about homes for sale in Marin, use tags like: “homes for sale in Marin”, “Marin homes for sale”, “homes for sale in Marin County”, “Marin County homes for sale”, “available homes in Marin”, available homes in Marin County,… Don’t also add “how to prep a home for sale” or “when to sell your home” as these are not what your video is about.</p>\n<p>Include long tail tags to catch those who are looking exactly for information like your video. Use all 500 characters available toward this tag task.</p>\n<p>Last, if you struggle with determining what your tags should be consider paying for YouTube Buddy or Vid IQ to get guidance.</p>\n<h3><strong>Engagement Metrics</strong></h3>\n<p>The last thing to mention in your quest to ensure that maximum viewers see your videos is encouraging engagement with your content. The YouTube algorithm cares about viewer interaction. To that end, comments play a pivotal role. To amplify your video&#8217;s recommendation potential, actively encourage viewers to engage by initiating conversations.</p>\n<p>Prompt your audience with thought-provoking questions related to the video topic, encouraging them to share their insights in the comments section. You could say something like, “What’s been YOUR experience with buying property? Let me know in the comments below!” or “What do you think of these homes for sale?”</p>\n<p>Encouraging comments and getting comments, fosters a community around your content and signals to YouTube that your video is generating interest.  This increases the likelihood of  YouTube promoting your content to new viewers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Starting a YouTube channel for real estate agents involves several key steps to establish a strong digital presence. From crafting a unique digital identity and setting up your channel with consistent branding elements like colors and logos, to customizing your profile with professional images and an effective channel description, these foundational actions set the stage for success.</p>\n<p>Enhancing your channel&#8217;s visibility through strategic SEO practices, including keyword research, engaging thumbnails, and optimized video descriptions, is crucial. Together, these steps ensure your real estate YouTube channel not only attracts but also retains a targeted audience interested in your content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-our-free-group-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Getting these contracts signed seems like a hassle to many buyer agents, especially when many homebuyers think buyer agent services are freebies courtesy of the seller.</p>\n<p>Instead, buyer agents often rely on an unspoken trust that the listing agreement in the MLS will secure their compensation for their efforts, which usually means a slice of the sale, typically between 2.5% to 3%</p>\n<p>But hello, wake-up call! The game is changing. A major shakeup is transforming the once-reliable commission structure as some MLS entries already, right now, are flaunting a big, fat zero in the commission field for buyer agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"\" class=\"pm-align--left\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">What’s the Problem for Buyer Agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Imagine this scenario: you&#8217;ve been hustling for a client, dedicating days, weeks, or heavens forbid, years, and suddenly that client is eyeing a property that is sporting that big fat zero in the commission field for the buyer agent. Ouch. How are you going to get paid for your work?</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Yes, even with court case resolutions still pending, the emergence of 0% commissions is already squeezing buyer agents. So before you start brushing all these court cases as some distant nightmare, reality check: this zero-commission trend is happening right now, as we speak.</p>\n<h3 id=\"\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What’s the Solution for Buyer Agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">What&#8217;s the solution? It&#8217;s simple, really. Get those buyer representation contracts signed, sealed, and delivered. It&#8217;s not just a smart move—it&#8217;s downright essential for safeguarding your hard-earned compensation.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">And here&#8217;s the kicker: we&#8217;re not just talking about securing those buyer representation agreements only for new clients. Nope, it&#8217;s time to hit the rewind button and go back to square one. Lock in those agreements for every client you&#8217;re currently working with, pronto.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Make a buyer representation agreement a non-negotiable part of your toolkit moving forward. You&#8217;ll be patting yourself on the back down the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crafting-compelling-homebuyer-presentations\">Crafting Compelling Homebuyer Presentations</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5593\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"380\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2-300x114.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2-768x292.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>With these looming transformations in the real estate business, the homebuying process will gain more clarity. With the dust settling, homebuyers will finally grasp the reality that they&#8217;re footing the bill for their buyer agent&#8217;s services, one way or another.</p>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s subtly embedded in the home&#8217;s price, as the current practice embeds it, or if it emerges as part of the closing costs—something increasingly likely to become the norm. This newfound transparency regarding the true cost of a buyer agent will prompt a seismic shift in the real estate industry.</p>\n<p>Homebuyers, now armed with this knowledge, are poised to meticulously assess and compare the caliber of service and personal attention offered by different buyer agents like never before. Welcome to the age of clear value demonstration, where buyer agents must rise to the occasion or risk being left in the dust.</p>\n<p>So, real estate buyer agents, it’s crucial now to master the art of Buyer Presentations. Here’s what you need to nail:</p>\n<h3>Demystify the Homebuying Process</h3>\n<p>First up, you’ll need to do what you have hopefully been doing all along and that is laying the home buying process out clearly from A to Z. That is, make sure your clients understand each step they’ll navigate with you on their journey to homeownership.</p>\n<h3>Showcase Real Estate Buyer Agent Services</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5594 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-2.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-2-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>What exactly do you bring to the table? Detail the scope of your services and the direct benefits clients can expect from your dedicated representation. Have you ever made a list of all the services you provide?</p>\n<p>If not, no worries, we&#8217;ve got your back. Keep an eye out for our upcoming blog, “A Bright Future for Real Estate Buyer Agents – 117 Services of Agent Value” for a comprehensive rundown.</p>\n<h3>Clarify Buyer Agent Compensation</h3>\n<p>And, now the hard part and the biggest change in how we buyer agents have been doing business. So, here&#8217;s the deal: now buyer agents must openly discuss how we&#8217;re compensated for the time and expertise we bring to the table.</p>\n<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more. Buyer agents need to pull back the curtain on the expenses we shoulder for our homebuyers. Many consumers are in the dark about the fact that we&#8217;re essentially working on contingency, pouring time and money into each deal with no guarantee of payment until the ink dries on closing day.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s draw a parallel here. Ever heard of lawyers working on contingency? They rake in higher fees for their successes, balancing out the risk of potentially not getting paid at all. Well, guess what? The same principle applies to us real estate agents.</p>\n<p>So, the next time someone tells you real estate agents are overpaid, it&#8217;s time to set the record straight. Break it down for them: we&#8217;re not just clocking in hours, weeks, and months for kicks and giggles. There&#8217;s a significant risk involved, and the only way to make it worth our while is by ensuring the pot at the end of the rainbow reflects that added risk.</p>\n<h3>Highlight Real Estate Brokerage Benefits</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5595 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-3.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-3.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-3-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>With this homebuyer presentation, you&#8217;ll be showcasing your value as a trusted agent, but don’t forget about the powerhouse behind the scenes: your brokerage.</p>\n<p>From safeguards to mitigate agent errors to streamlined systems enhancing the buyer experience, make it crystal clear why your brokerage is the top choice for savvy home buyers seeking expertise and excellence.</p>\n<h3>Define Your Real Estate Agent Distinctiveness</h3>\n<p>And last, it&#8217;s time to crank up the volume and showcase what makes you stand out from the crowd.

The seller often covers this fee, but industry changes could shake this up</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-was-the-impact-of-a-landmark-court-loss-on-buyer-agent-commissions\">What was the impact of a landmark court loss on buyer agent commissions?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/law-and-ethics/breaking-down-sitzer-burnett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This court case</a> was a game-changer, putting pressure on traditional commission structures and potentially reducing how much buyer agents pocket from home sales.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-department-of-justice-doj-statement-affect-buyer-agents\">How does the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-02/420087.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Justice (DOJ) statement</a> affect buyer agents?</h3>\n<p>The DOJ&#8217;s aims to make real estate transactions more transparent. Buyer agents will need to adapt to clearer commission disclosures and possibly tighter competition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-do-to-prepare-for-industry-changes-as-a-buyer-agent\">What should buyer agents do to prepare for industry changes?</h3>\n<p>Stay informed and flexible. Brush up your Buyer Presentation skills. Embrace technology, enhance your negotiation skills, and consider diversifying your services. The goal? To stay valuable no matter how the market shifts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-unintended-consequences-of-payment-shifts-in-real-estate\">What are some unintended consequences of payment shifts in real estate?</h3>\n<p>Shifts towards buyer-paid commissions could lead buyers to bargain harder or skip out on using an agent altogether. It’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p>Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p>Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. Learn to clarify your value!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\">How do real estate agents typically receive their payments?</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, a home transaction closing triggers the payment to agents.  The closing statement accounts for the commission payment as part of its details.  The escrow officer sends the commission to each agent&#8217;s broker &#8211; who then disburses it to the agents after deducting for their fees (splits).</p>\n<p>Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\">What is the average income for a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p>As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. Location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full-time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\">What is the average real estate agent commission charge?</h3>\n<p>Typically, the buying and selling agents equally share the average US commission, which is generally 5% to 6% of a property’s total sale price.  These numbers vary between locations, different agents, and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\">Does an agent&#8217;s brokerage pay the entire commission to the agent?</h3>\n<p>Most likely no. Most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\">Can I negotiate my realtor’s commission rate?</h3>\n<p>Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. You should discuss the commission before signing any agreement</p>\n<p>Some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\">When do real estate agents receive their commission?</h3>\n<p>Agents receive their commissions upon the closing of deals. They do not receive any payment for their time or expenses until after the deals close. Thus, real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\">How much do real estate agents make if the house doesn’t sell?</h3>\n<p>Generally, nothing. The agent is out their time and their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\">Do brokerages pay real estate agents a salary monthly?</h3>\n<p>No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals, and they earn their pay when they successfully close a deal.  Some brokers pay agents a salary, but not generally.</p>\n",

While some of these changes have already begun to manifest, others may remain speculative. However, real estate agents who arm themselves with readiness for these possibilities are far more likely to thrive than those who do not.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced Transparency Regarding Real Estate Agent Fees</h3>\n<p>In the evolving real estate business landscape, buyers will gain clearer insights into the costs associated with purchasing a home, including understanding that the agent&#8217;s fee is currently part of the home&#8217;s price.  Buyer agent fees are not “free” and never have been.</p>\n<h3>Direct Negotiation Between Buyer Agents and Home Buyers</h3>\n<p>Because homebuyers will be aware that their agent’s fees are part of the home’s prices and that these fees are open to negotiation, homebuyers and their buyer agents will engage in more straightforward discussions, with homebuyers actively participating in negotiating the buyer agent’s fee.</p>\n<h3>More Competitive Agent Commissions Coming?</h3>\n<p>Because homebuyers may start to openly negotiate with buyer agents, the industry may see more competitive pricing.  Further, that may lead to more tailored and defined services provided by buyer agents.</p>\n<h3>Do-It-Yourself Choice for Future Homebuyers</h3>\n<p>Homebuyers will learn that their agent’s fees are not only negotiable, but their home buying options include the choice to purchase a home without an agent if they feel confident to do so.  That’s a big change!</p>\n<h3>Home Price Drops Coming?</h3>\n<p>Will home prices drop if buyer agent commissions decrease? Not likely. House prices are determined by the market, not by commission rates. Even if the traditional commission structure is altered, it’s the market dynamics that ultimately dictate pricing so home values aren’t likely to change even if commission percentages decline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-uncertain-future-of-real-estate-buyer-agents\">The Uncertain Future of Real Estate Buyer Agents?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5581\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"332\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-1-300x100.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-1-768x255.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Ok, let&#8217;s delve into a pressing question that&#8217;s been on many of our minds: Will buyer agents become obsolete?</p>\n<h3>Real Estate Skills for Staying Power</h3>\n<p>Rest assured, the role of buyer&#8217;s agents is not going anywhere. Many buyers will continue to value the expertise and personalized service provided by buyer&#8217;s agents, especially because a home purchase is usually the biggest purchase a consumer will make in their lifetime, it’s risky to go it alone.</p>\n<h3>The Failure of Real Estate Disrupters</h3>\n<p>For years, there’s been a bunch of companies trying to shake things up and change who earns the real estate commission. But guess what? Most have fallen short of changing the industry and some even pivoted to join it.</p>\n<p>For example, apparently, Zillow first came on the scene with the goal of replacing real estate agents.  But Zillow quickly discovered they had a last-mile problem.  The last mile refers to – a common supply chain problem where the last mile of transporting a product is rife with logistical challenges.  Zillow discovered that an agent’s local knowledge is critical, so Zillow pivoted to selling leads to real estate buyer agents, not replacing them.</p>\n<p>On a side note, Zillow also found out the hard way that their specialized value estimates, “zestimates” don’t stack up to the actual knowledge of agents who visit local neighborhoods and homes regularly.  Relying on their zestimates and buying up homes to flip them, Zillow lost $230 million and exited the ibuying business blaming its failure on their own zestimates home value algorithms for inaccurately predicting home values.</p>\n<h3>Other Historical Disrupter Precedents</h3>\n<p>When discount stock brokerages arrived on the scene, many pundits said that would be the end of stockbrokers. It wasn’t. Similarly, when more people understood that they could represent themselves in court, that didn’t stop people from hiring lawyers to do it instead.</p>\n<p>Yes, things are changing, but that doesn’t mean that the role of buyer agents is ending, quite the opposite.</p>\n<h3>Unmatched Investment Significance of Buying Homes</h3>\n<p>Purchasing a home is often the largest investment individuals make, similar in importance to investing in the stock market or navigating the legal system. The stakes are high, and the value of a knowledgeable advocate by your side is immeasurable. The expertise of real estate buyer agents will remain in demand due to the importance of professional guidance in a major transaction.</p>\n<h3>Professional Advantages of Buyer Agent Expertise</h3>\n<p>Agents offer more than access to listings. Agent representation brings the power of negotiation, insider knowledge, and a vast network that can lead to better pricing and opportunities. Agent expertise can be the key to unlocking the best deals and avoiding overpaying.</p>\n<h3>Risk Mitigation for Homebuyers</h3>\n<p>With an agent’s guidance, buyers are less likely to encounter costly, potentially devastating, mistakes. Agents provide a wealth of local knowledge, insights into home-specific concerns, and a seasoned eye for spotting potential issues, ensuring a smoother and more secure purchasing process.</p>\n<h3>Data Overload Regarding properties</h3>\n<p>While potential buyers have more information at their fingertips than ever before, the abundance of data can be overwhelming. The high availability of property details has paradoxically increased the reliance on buyer agents. The more information there is, the more buyers seek a professional to navigate the complexities, validate the data, and clarify the path forward.</p>\n<p>In essence, the role of buyer agents is not diminishing but evolving.

The future of buyer agent compensation is shifting away from being an indirect cost included in the home&#8217;s sale price.</p>\n<h3>The Department of Justice’s Vision</h3>\n<p>Let’s first start with the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) stated vision.  If you read Part 1 of our 5-Part blog series or watched our other videos then you know this whole idea of the home seller not being able to offer a buyer agent broker fee on the MLS came from the DOJ’s “Statement of Interest” in one of the many lawsuits with the same issues.</p>\n<p>And their vision regarding how buyer agents would be paid?  Well, the DOJ said it does NOT see a future where homebuyers have to dig deeper into their pockets at closing to pay their agents.  Instead, the DOJ foresees a world where homebuyers request that the home seller pay their buyer agent fees as a condition of their offer for the home.</p>\n<p>The DOJ contends that “Thus, the current practice could continue, where the seller factors the commissions into the offer the seller is willing to accept.” So, even with all the legal ramifications, in the end, the home seller may still pay for the buyer’s agent.</p>\n<p>Sounds great for home buyers, right? Well, maybe, it’s all just math.  For example, if a seller gets an offer for $1,000,000 and the buyer asks for $25,000 to be paid to their agent and the seller gets another offer that doesn’t ask for anything to be paid to their agent yet their offer is $974,000, then the first offer is still better.</p>\n<p>However, homebuyers often feel anchored to the listing price request.  Therefore, if two homebuyers offer list price from the home and only one adds the condition of the buyer’s agent fee, the homebuyer without that request will win the home every time.</p>\n<p>Here are two other options for how future real estate buyer agents may be paid:</p>\n<h3>Direct Payment from Homebuyers</h3>\n<p>The straightforward route is that homebuyers would pay their agents directly when they purchase a home. In that event, buyer agent fees would become just another closing cost. Closing costs are customarily paid on top of the purchase price – costs like escrow fees, title insurance, lender fees, and property taxes could then also include buyer agent fees.</p>\n<p>But note, if buyer agent fees are paid as a part of closing costs, there will need to be a change in how home purchases are financed. Lender rules will need to allow buyer agent fees to be part of mortgage financing. But how hard could that change be? Lenders already pay for buyer agent fees because they are currently part of the home price.</p>\n<h3>Seller Concessions Directly For Homebuyers</h3>\n<p>Another possibility is that home sellers may end up offering to pay buyer agent fees much like how sellers can offer to credit homebuyers some stipend to pay for new carpet or they may offer to pay down a buyer’s loan.</p>\n<p>Note, it doesn’t seem that any new law could prevent home sellers from making this type of concession. It is different than the traditional method of a seller paying the listing agent 5 or 6% and then the listing agent pays the buyer agent broker.  In this case, the buyer agent fee offer would be between the home seller and the homebuyer, not the seller and their listing agent.</p>\n<p>However, suppose all home sellers make this concession because their listing agent tells them to. In that case, the results might undo any benefit to homebuyers that the DOJ believes would otherwise occur from preventing sellers from making buyer agent offers through their listing agent agreement.</p>\n<p>Still, seller concessions to buyers would be under their own terms. Home sellers might offer a percentage of the sale or a flat fee to a buyer’s agent. And, if the fee doesn’t match what the buyer agent and homebuyer have agreed on, the homebuyer would still need to make up any difference with a direct payment to the buyer’s agent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-the-business-of-buyer-agents-may-evolve\">How the Future of Real Estate Buyer Agents’ Business Model May Evolve</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5583\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"319\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-1-300x96.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-1-768x245.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>If the DOJ’s statement is adopted by the courts, then the landscape for buyer agents could evolve to something new and different. Here&#8217;s what we could see:</p>\n<h3>Buyer Agent and Homebuyer Fee Negotiations</h3>\n<p>Under the new DOJ proposal, buyer agents will need to negotiate their fees. The DOJ anticipates that if agents need to justify their worth directly to the buyers who are footing the bill, they will compete for the business which may put downward pressure on customary buyer agent commission rates.</p>\n<h3>Buyer Agent Experience Will Matter More</h3>\n<p>If buyer agents are not all offered the same compensation from an MLS listing as they are now, this payment structure of all agents being offered the same commission rate irrespective of their experience or knowledge could shift.</p>\n<p>Buyer agent compensation could shift to more closely reflecting an agent&#8217;s experience and expertise. Seasoned agents might command higher fees, while newcomers may need to lower their rates or collaborate with experienced colleagues to bolster their value proposition.</p>\n<h3>More Niche Specialization</h3>\n<p>Although always a good idea for agents, even more agents may be attracted to offering niche specialization. Those agents could then justify their fees by specializing in particular market segments, offering unparalleled expertise in specific areas.</p>\n<h3>Industry Shakeup May Cause Real Estate Buyer Agents to Quit</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5584 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Small-Blog-Images.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Small-Blog-Images.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Small-Blog-Images-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>The move to more variable commissions and the need to justify agent value may squeeze some agents out of the business, especially those wedded to the traditional models. However, this might mean a less crowded field for those buyer agents who adapt, potentially leading to more business for the adaptable agents.</p>\n<h3>Rethinking Agent Roles &#038; the Skills Needed for Success</h3>\n<p>Buyer agents will likely need to become adept at conducting buyer consultations, thoroughly explaining the buying process and their unique value. Buyer agents also may end up offering tiered pricing for different levels of service or commitment.</p>\n<h3>Innovative Pricing Models</h3>\n<p>We might see agents experimenting with new pricing strategies, such as flat fees, hourly rates, or a la carte service menus, allowing homebuyers to tailor the services to their needs and budgets.</p>\n<p>In any event on exactly how the court cases are resolved, these shifts in the real estate industry suggest a future where buyer agents must clearly communicate their value and adapt to a marketplace where homebuyers have greater influence over the terms of agent compensation.</p>\n<p>This could lead to a more transparent, customer-focused industry that rewards agents who can effectively demonstrate their worth and adapt to the evolving real estate landscape.</p>\n<p>If you’re unsure how to explain your value and the best ways to do it, we have that information coming up in Part 3 &#038; 4 of this blog series.

The shift in how agents are compensated and perceived is likely to enlighten more people about the true value of an agent&#8217;s role, which extends far beyond merely opening doors and showing properties. This heightened appreciation would stem from a better public understanding of the nuanced, multifaceted nature of hard-working buyer agents.</p>\n<h3>Appreciation of Real Estate Agent Investments</h3>\n<p>Along with agents describing their value to homebuyers, buyers could come to know that agents make significant investments in their profession.</p>\n<p>Agents cover all their own operational expenses, pay their broker and referral partners significant portions of their commission, all with the high-stakes risk of earning no income without successful deals.</p>\n<p>When the public comes to understand that agents make significant personal investments to provide value with no guaranteed pay, this could foster greater respect for agents as the public gains insight into the financial and emotional stakes involved in the real estate profession.</p>\n<h3>Potential for Direct Compensation for Time Invested</h3>\n<p>The changing landscape might open doors for real estate buyer agents to be compensated for their time, irrespective of the transaction outcome. This potential paradigm shift means agents could explore billing models that ensure they are paid for the professional services they provide, much like consultants in other fields.</p>\n<h3>Enhancement of Professional Standards in Real Estate Agents</h3>\n<p>As the industry demands more transparency and value demonstration, it&#8217;s likely that the market will naturally filter out agents who cannot articulate or deliver on their value proposition. This could result in a professional environment populated by highly skilled, value-driven agents, elevating the overall quality and reputation of the profession.</p>\n<p>In essence, these transformations could lead to a more respected, value-oriented profession where buyer agents are acknowledged not just for the deals they close but for the comprehensive, expert service they provide to their clients. This shift promises to not only enhance the perception of buyer agents but also to cultivate a marketplace where true professional merit is the cornerstone of success. And that’s all good!</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Our journey through the changing landscape of real estate has shed light on the potential transformations ahead, particularly in how buyer agents are compensated. From enhanced transparency to direct negotiation between agents and homebuyers, the future holds both challenges and opportunities for the industry.</p>\n<p>Yet, amidst these shifts, one thing remains clear: the enduring value of buyer agents in guiding clients through the intricate process of purchasing a home. As the profession adapts and evolves, it&#8217;s poised to emerge stronger, more respected, and more client-focused than ever before, ushering in a new era of professionalism and transparency in real estate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-our-free-group-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

This fee is often covered by the seller, but industry changes could shake this up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-was-the-impact-of-a-landmark-court-loss-on-buyer-agent-commissions\">What was the impact of a landmark court loss on buyer agent commissions?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/law-and-ethics/breaking-down-sitzer-burnett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This court case</a> was a game-changer, putting pressure on traditional commission structures and potentially reducing how much buyer agents pocket from home sales.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-department-of-justice-doj-statement-affect-buyer-agents\">How does the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-02/420087.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Justice (DOJ) statement</a> affect buyer agents?</h3>\n<p>The DOJ&#8217;s aims to make real estate transactions more transparent. For buyer agents, this means adapting to clearer commission disclosures and possibly tighter competition as a result of the method the DOJ hopes to make the new law of the land, namely that sellers not be allowed to make an offer of compensation to buyer agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-do-to-prepare-for-industry-changes-as-a-buyer-agent\">What should I do to prepare for industry changes as a buyer agent?</h3>\n<p>Stay informed and flexible. Brush up your Buyer Presentation skills. Embrace technology, enhance your negotiation skills, and consider diversifying your services. The goal? To stay valuable no matter how the market shifts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-unintended-consequences-of-payment-shifts-in-real-estate\">What are some unintended consequences of payment shifts in real estate?</h3>\n<p>Shifts towards buyer-paid commissions could lead buyers to bargain harder or skip out on using an agent altogether. It’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p>Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p>Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. Also, lean into marketing yourself digitally; it’s where the eyeballs are at!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\">How Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid?</h3>\n<p>Traditionally an agent doesn’t get paid until a home is sold. The commission payment is accounted for as a part of the closing statement. Each agent’s broker &#8211; for the buyer agent and the seller agent &#8211; is sent the commission for disbursement to the agents after the broker deduct their split. Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\">What is the Average Income for a Real Estate Agent?</h3>\n<p>As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. Location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\">What is the Average Real Estate Agent Commission Charge?</h3>\n<p>The average commission in the US is 5.5% of a property’s total sale price and is usually evenly split between the buying and selling agents. These numbers vary between location, different agents and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\">Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid the Entire Commission?</h3>\n<p>Most likely no. Most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\">Can I Negotiate My Realtor’s Commission Rate?</h3>\n<p>Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. The commission should be discussed before signing any agreement.</p>\n<p>Some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\">When do Real Estate Agents get Paid Their Commission?</h3>\n<p>Agents get paid when deals close. They are not paid anything for their time or expenses before that. Thus, real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\">How Much Do Real Estate Agents Make if the House Doesn’t Sell?</h3>\n<p>Generally, nothing. The agent is out their time and their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\">Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid Monthly?</h3>\n<p>No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals. There are a couple of brokers that pay agents a salary, but it’s not the general way it’s done.</p>\n",

How has the real estate business already changed in the last decade or two?</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-digital-shift-in-the-real-estate-industry\">The Digital Shift in the Real Estate Industry</h3>\n<p>Before the internet brought us online platforms like Zillow.com and Realtor.com, buyer agents were the sole gatekeepers of the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS), the magical vault where all potential homes for sale were listed.</p>\n<p>As such it was buyer agents who conjured up home suggestions, orchestrated viewings, and guided buyers through the mystical world of real estate. Fast forward to today, and a staggering 90% of homebuyers start their quest online and many continue to use those platforms to be notified of new homes for sale that may interest them.</p>\n<p>Thus, the digital revolution has democratized access to real estate listings and made it easy for everyone to know what homes are for sale with the exclusion of off-market listings which are still only known to agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-perception-of-real-estate-agents-suffers\">Public Perception of Real Estate Agents Suffers</h3>\n<p>This seismic shift in knowledge about homes for sale ushered in a wave of public skepticism. The pervasive belief now is that agents might not be the champions of value they once were, given that buyers can easily see what homes are for sale and when those homes will have an open house for the public.</p>\n<p>The skepticism has rebirthed older concerns as well like the thought that agents are not incentivized to bargain hard for their clients because agents earn a percentage of the sale price of a home.</p>\n<p>However, any seasoned agent knows this narrative misses the mark entirely. The truth is, the slight variance in commission from negotiating down is minuscule compared to the paramount importance of closing the deal—securing that essential paycheck and covering the myriad costs already invested in the client.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s a bigger picture — the long game. Exceptional service today means repeat business tomorrow and a stream of referrals, and agents need these to have a thriving real estate career.</p>\n<p>Why would any agent jeopardize future referrals for a tiny bit more dough? Agents are in it for the long haul, deeply invested in their client’s satisfaction and their professional reputation, both of which are critical for sustained success in the ever-evolving world of real estate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-perception-results-in-criticism\">Public Perception Results in Criticism</h3>\n<p>However, here we are, the real estate waters are getting choppy with numerous lawsuits challenging the traditional commission structure. These legal disputes are rooted in a widespread public perception that real estate agents are paid too much.</p>\n<p>In recent years, a significant number of lawsuits have emerged, all targeting the established norms of how real estate commissions are determined and disbursed.  Let’s talk about how commissions are generally determined and disbursed right now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-how-buyer-agents-are-paid-how-commissions-have-worked\">Understanding How Buyer Agents Are Paid &#8211; How Commissions have worked</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5377\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"448\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-300x134.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-768x344.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Traditionally, when it comes to real estate transactions, it&#8217;s the home sellers who&#8217;ve been picking up the tab for the commissions of both buyer and seller agents. This has been the case for the last 100 years.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it rolls out: The seller negotiates and signs an agreement to pay their listing agent some set percentage of the sale. The seller knows that the seller’s total percentage will include some agreed-upon percentage for the buyer’s agent as well.</p>\n<p>When a property sells, the listing agent’s brokerage then shares a portion of this commission with the buyer’s agent.</p>\n<p>Why does this system make sense?  Because with an offer of compensation for buyer agents, the selling agent ignites all the buyer agents, or let&#8217;s call them the worker bees, to sell the home. These bees buzz around opening doors and showing properties, all while being safeguarded by their brokerage’s liability insurance to ensure the homes are safe.</p>\n<p>Now, dive into the world of the Multiple Listing Service, or MLS, where the plot thickens. There, buyer agents are offered a percentage of the sale – a percentage that can and does vary from property to property.</p>\n<p>However, once listed in the MLS, an offer of buyer agent compensation is a binding promise, creating an obligation that the buyer’s agent will get paid despite that the buyer’s agent is not a party to the contract between the seller and the seller agent’s brokerage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lawsuits-aiming-to-change-the-status-quo\">Lawsuits Aiming to Change the Status Quo</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5378\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"420\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-300x126.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-768x323.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>There is currently a flurry of lawsuits challenging the traditional framework of agent commissions, particularly focusing on the practice where sellers bear the cost of buyer agent fees.</p>\n<p>These legal challenges allege that such arrangements unjustly inflate commission costs, and they accuse various industry players, including brokerages, realtor associations, and multiple listing services (MLSs), of colluding to enforce these fee structures, potentially breaching federal antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>The spotlight recently turned to the landmark Sitzer/Burnett trial in Kansas City, a case that sent ripples throughout the real estate industry. The trial concluded with a groundbreaking verdict against the National Association of Realtors (NAR), finding them culpable of conspiring to inflate agent commissions.</p>\n<p>This verdict wasn&#8217;t just another legal decision; it was monumental, marking the first instance where such a case concluded with a staggering $1.8 billion in damages awarded.</p>\n<p>While the direct impact of this case is localized to the participants in Missouri, its implications are far-reaching. That’s because this landmark judgment is causing a wave of similar copycat lawsuits to pop up nationwide igniting a national reevaluation of how real estate commissions are structured and challenging the status quo of how brokerages and their agents are paid for the services they provide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-brokerages-agreed-to-do-to-end-the-cases\">What Brokerages Agreed to Do to End The Cases</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5379\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"356\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-300x107.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-768x273.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>To solve the issues at hand, real estate players (associations, brokerage, and MLSs) have agreed to change their process, including removing any requirement that a seller must offer the buyer’s agent brokerage any compensation.</p>\n<p>In the Nosalek case against an MLS, the MLS agrees to lower the minimum offer from the seller’s agent from 1 cent to $0.</p>\n<p>So the players in these cases agree that sellers no longer need to offer buyer agents any offer of compensation and that the MLS involved will allow listing agents to fill out the field regarding a buyer agent’s brokerage compensation with a zero.</p>\n<p>As similar lawsuits proliferate across the United States, it seems likely that these cases may set a new real estate standard for how real estate agents are paid.</p>\n<p>But wait, what has happened in the courtrooms is not the biggest problem for buyer agents!</p>\n<h2 id=\"sellers-no-longer-to-pay-buyer-agent\">Sellers No Longer to Pay Buyer Agent?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5380\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"995\" height=\"427\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6.webp 995w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-300x129.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-768x330.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px\" /></p>\n<p>The biggest problem stems from an opinion written to the judge of a case. The Department of Justice (DOJ) stepped into the spotlight in the Nosalek case by entering a <strong>“Statement of Interest”</strong> regarding the case’s proposed settlement.  By the way, the DOJ is not a party in this lawsuit, but this statement is allowed under US law, <strong>28 U.S.C. § 517</strong>.</p>\n<p>In that statement of interest, the DOJ urged the court to <strong>reject the proposed settlements</strong> and to instead <strong>require that sellers not be allowed to make any offer of compensation</strong> to buyer agent brokerages.</p>\n<p>Why?  The DOJ argues that allowing sellers to offer any buyer agent broker commissions perpetuates a system where seller agents might pressure their clients into maintaining &#8220;customary&#8221; commission offers.</p>\n<p>This pressure is driven by a seller agent’s concern that offering anything lower than the customary amount might lead buyer agents into “steering” (an illegal practice) their clients towards listings with higher offers of commission.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the DOJ argues that as long as the door is open for sellers to offer buyer agent commission fees, there&#8217;s a risk that the status quo will remain unchallenged upholding business as usual, and nothing really changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-real-estate-buyer-agents\">The Future of Real Estate Buyer Agents</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5381\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"406\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7-300x122.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7-768x312.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>And there we are at the crux of the matter.  If the court adopts the DOJ’s proposal and then courts across the nation also adopt that court’s decision – which is very likely as that is how case law is made and can grow everywhere &#8211; then we see that this one court’s decision will have far-reaching consequences.</p>\n<p>Sellers will no longer be allowed to make an offer of compensation to buyer agent brokerages and MLSs will no longer have a field that creates an obligation for the buyer agent to be paid for their services.</p>\n<p>Does that mean buyer agents will cease to exist or that they won’t get paid moving forward?  Of course not!</p>\n<p>We have more blogs coming out about this significant shift in the buyer agent business, what may occur, and how to handle it, so drop us an email with the subject line “newsletter” and we’ll add you to the list to be notified when our next blog drops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>The real estate landscape is undergoing a seismic shift as court cases challenge the traditional norms of commission payments.

This fee is often covered by the seller, but industry changes could shake this up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-was-the-impact-of-a-landmark-court-loss-on-buyer-agent-commissions\">What was the impact of a landmark court loss on buyer agent commissions?</h3>\n<p>This court case was a game-changer, putting pressure on traditional commission structures and potentially reducing how much buyer agents pocket from home sales.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-department-of-justice-doj-statement-affect-buyer-agents\">How does the Department of Justice (DOJ) statement affect buyer agents?</h3>\n<p>The DOJ&#8217;s aims to make real estate transactions more transparent. For buyer agents, this means adapting to clearer commission disclosures and possibly tighter competition as a result of the method the DOJ hopes to make the new law of the land, namely that sellers not be allowed to make an offer of compensation to buyer agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-do-to-prepare-for-industry-changes-as-a-buyer-agent\">What should I do to prepare for industry changes as a buyer agent?</h3>\n<p>Stay informed and flexible. Brush up your Buyer Presentation skills. Embrace technology, enhance your negotiation skills, and consider diversifying your services. The goal? To stay valuable no matter how the market shifts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-unintended-consequences-of-payment-shifts-in-real-estate\">What are some unintended consequences of payment shifts in real estate?</h3>\n<p>Shifts towards buyer-paid commissions could lead buyers to bargain harder or skip out on using an agent altogether. It’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p>Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p>Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. Also, lean into marketing yourself digitally; it’s where the eyeballs are at!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\">How Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid?</h3>\n<p>Traditionally an agent doesn’t get paid until a home is sold. The commission payment is accounted for as a part of the closing statement. Each agent’s broker &#8211; for the buyer agent and the seller agent &#8211; is sent the commission for disbursement to the agents after the broker deduct their split. Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\">What is the Average Income for a Real Estate Agent?</h3>\n<p>As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. Location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\">What is the Average Real Estate Agent Commission Charge?</h3>\n<p>The average commission in the US is 5.5% of a property’s total sale price and is usually evenly split between the buying and selling agents. These numbers vary between location, different agents and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\">Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid the Entire Commission?</h3>\n<p>Most likely no. Most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\">Can I Negotiate My Realtor’s Commission Rate?</h3>\n<p>Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. The commission should be discussed before signing any agreement.</p>\n<p>Some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\">When do Real Estate Agents get Paid Their Commission?</h3>\n<p>Agents get paid when deals close. They are not paid anything for their time or expenses before that. Thus, real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\">How Much Do Real Estate Agents Make if the House Doesn’t Sell?</h3>\n<p>Generally, nothing. The agent is out their time and their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\">Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid Monthly?</h3>\n<p>No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals. There are a couple of brokers that pay agents a salary, but it’s not the general way it’s done.</p>\n",
