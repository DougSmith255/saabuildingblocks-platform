That’s why we went straight to the agents who’ve <em>actually</em> worked there and don’t have a script to follow.</p>\n<p>We pulled anonymous agent reviews from Glassdoor and Reddit, where people tell it like it is. These platforms offer a look behind the curtain—no filters, no fear of getting cut from the company holiday party.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>We used Glassdoor’s official rating system to rank the firms, so we’re not just winging it here. Whether you’re comparing the top 10 brokerage firms or checking out the eXp Realty reviews for new agents, this is the context you’ve been missing.</p>\n<p>Now let’s talk about the pros… briefly. “Great flexibility,” “cool tech,” “supportive culture”—yeah, those show up everywhere. What matters more? The cons. The deal-breakers. The things people <em>don’t</em> say out loud during onboarding.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ea643aaed0006a87-Real-Estate-Brokerage-Reviews-You-Can-Actually-Trust-Ranking-Criteria-Real-Talk-from-Agents-Who-Dont-Sugarcoat.webp/public\" alt=\"Real Estate Brokerage Reviews You Can Actually Trust, Ranking Criteria Real Talk from Agents Who Don’t Sugarcoat\" class=\"wp-image-266952 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Real-Estate-Brokerage-Reviews-You-Can-Actually-Trust-Ranking-Criteria-Real-Talk-from-Agents-Who-Dont-Sugarcoat.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Real-Estate-Brokerage-Reviews-You-Can-Actually-Trust-Ranking-Criteria-Real-Talk-from-Agents-Who-Dont-Sugarcoat-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Because when it comes to real estate agent reviews, the one-star bombs often tell you way more than five-star fluff ever could. And if you&#8217;re sizing up the top real estate brokerages in the US, you need to know what could go wrong before you sign anything. While reviews reach into the past, know that brokerage profitability matters too because that is likely to define your future. So don’t miss our blog all about what are the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/profits\">top real estate companies by profitability</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"insider-feedback-on-12-top-brokerages-from-worst-to-first\">Insider Feedback on 12 Top Brokerages: From Worst to First</h2>\n<p>Time to separate the hype from the helpful. We&#8217;re ranking 12 major real estate brokerage companies based on what actually matters—real estate brokerage reviews from agents who’ve worked there lived it, and left anonymous feedback without sugarcoating a thing.</p>\n<p>These are unfiltered real estate agent reviews, covering the real pros, the ugly cons, and whether they’d actually recommend their brokerage to a friend. If two companies tied in rating, we broke the tie based on that “would-you-recommend” factor.</p>\n<p>Trying to figure out which of the <strong>top real estate brokers in the USA</strong> are legit and which are just running on reputation? You’re about to find out.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compass-fancy-tech-friendly-vibes\">Compass – Fancy Tech &#038; Friendly Vibes</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ecc4214693d7a6ac-Compass-Realty-Logo.webp/public\" alt=\"Compass Realty Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239642 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Compass pulls a 3.7 rating from over 2,000 real estate brokerage reviews, with 60% of agents saying they’d recommend it and 67% approving of the CEO. Solid, but not groundbreaking. That’s a dead-last agent ranking!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents consistently praise the tech, culture, and brand recognition—especially in luxury markets. The tools are sleek, the vibe is collaborative, and the Compass name does some heavy lifting with clients. Leadership and support also get a thumbs up, and agents like the freedom to manage their own schedules (although that exists at pretty much every brokerage).</p>\n<p>But before you get too cozy, here’s the part that doesn’t show up on Glassdoor: Compass is the least profitable brokerage among all publicly traded firms. Yep—again, <em>dead last</em>. We break down the earnings disaster in our <u>blog on brokerage profitability</u>, but spoiler: even the branding can’t cover that kind of red ink.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-compass-cons-when-the-aesthetic-doesnt-pay-the-bills\">The Compass Cons: When the Aesthetic Doesn’t Pay the Bills</h3>\n<p>Now for the part that <em>really</em> matters: the stuff agents complain about when no one from management is listening. Compass may get points for polish, but the real estate agent reviews make it clear—there are cracks behind the clean branding.</p>\n<p>Here’s what’s consistently rubbing agents the wrong way:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Fees and Rough Commission Splits</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Compass isn’t cheap to hang your license. Agents frequently mention hefty monthly fees, confusing commission structures, and extra per-transaction costs that add up fast—especially for those not consistently closing deals. One agent put it bluntly: <em>“Low split, then another 3% per deal? That’s annoying.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>No Leads, No Problem? Actually… It’s a Problem.</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The brokerage may provide sleek tools, but the leads? Not so much. Reviews repeatedly call out the complete lack of company-generated business. Several agents said flat-out: <em>“They don’t provide leads.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>High Pressure, Low Warm Fuzzies</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Many reviews describe Compass as competitive and cutthroat—fine if you thrive on 24/7 hustle, less ideal if you were hoping for work-life balance. One agent described it as, <em>“Just like every other brokerage that swears they’re the best.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Team or Bust</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Compass leans heavily on a team-based structure, which can leave solo agents feeling lost in the shuffle. Multiple reviews say that without a team, it’s hard to gain traction—and support from management feels nonexistent unless you&#8217;re already producing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Corporate Vibes, Minus the Warmth</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Despite the “cool” aesthetic, several agents described the office culture as cold and corporate. There’s a sense that higher-ups stay distant and agents can easily feel like just another headcount. One review summed it up: <em>“Big company, low commission—get lost in the crowd.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So while Compass earns its spot among the top real estate brokerage companies by name recognition and flash, the agent reviews suggest a different story: great surface-level shine, but some serious internal growing pains. If you’re not already a top producer with a team, the costs might just outweigh the perks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"redfin-structure-salary-and-a-side-of-burnout\">Redfin – Structure, Salary, and a Side of Burnout</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7d72451463bdcc61-Redfin-Logo.webp/public\" alt=\"Redfin Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239649 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Redfin earns a 3.6 rating with 65% of agents recommending it to a friend and 79% approving of the CEO.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Redfin’s model is different from most of the top real estate brokerage companies. It’s not your typical 1099 commission-only gig. Agents often receive a base salary, benefits, and enjoy a collaborative team culture, making it feel more like a W-2 job with corporate perks.  Agents who like structure and teamwork tend to feel at home at Redfin. Reviews frequently highlight a collaborative culture, supportive coworkers, and management that doesn’t ghost you when things get tough. The ability to work from home, enjoy a flexible(ish) schedule, and earn a base salary with benefits gives it a corporate vibe—but in a way that some agents actually appreciate. And while the tech can be a lot, agents do give Redfin props for keeping things organized and efficient—at least when it’s working.</p>\n<p>It sounds like a dream setup—until you scroll past the star ratings and into the actual complaints.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-redfin-cons-salary-stability-comes-at-a-cost\">The Redfin Cons: Salary Stability Comes at a Cost</h3>\n<p>If Redfin feels more like a corporate job, that’s because… it kind of is. And the <strong>real estate agent reviews</strong> make it clear that stability often comes with strings.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commission Caps &#038; Pay Frustration</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Many agents say the income potential just doesn’t cut it. While the base salary is nice for consistency, the commission structure is limited, and some agents feel they’re leaving money on the table compared to more traditional brokerages.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Weekend Burnout Is Real</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents love the “flexibility”—until they realize it includes working most weekends and juggling a non-stop client load. Reviews call out a lack of real work-life balance due to the heavy volume and rigid expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Clogged Career Paths</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Looking to move up? Not so fast. Many agents feel like they hit a ceiling quickly, with few opportunities to advance or grow inside the company.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Too Many Clients, Too Little Time</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>That structured lead system? It can flood agents with more customers than they can handle, leading to burnout and customer service fatigue. As one review put it: <em>“Great place to start, exhausting to maintain.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Technology Overwhelm</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Yes, Redfin has tech—but some agents say it&#8217;s overkill. The systems are clunky, CRMs could be better, and the constant updates can be more frustrating than helpful.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if you’re someone who likes structure, salary, and teamwork, Redfin could feel like the best real estate brokerage for your needs. But if you&#8217;re after uncapped income, flexible growth, and control over your schedule, you may want to read between the lines—because these real estate reviews show that consistency comes at a cost.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"douglas-elliman-prestige-perks-and-a-few-cracks-in-the-foundation\">Douglas Elliman – Prestige, Perks, and a Few Cracks in the Foundation</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a6afd9f9962d9e1e-Douglas-Elliman-Logo.webp/public\" alt=\"Douglas Elliman Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239643 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Douglas Elliman pulls a 3.8 with 67% of agents saying they’d recommend it to a friend, and a solid 88% CEO approval rating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents rave about the brand prestige, strong training and support, and an office culture that leans collaborative. The company’s long-standing presence in luxury markets brings a level of clout that newer brokerages can’t fake. Add in a flexible schedule, a stash of resources, and seasoned leadership (depending on the office), and Douglas Elliman has its perks—especially if you’re newer and want exposure in high-end real estate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-douglas-elliman-cons-fancy-brand-familiar-problems\">The Douglas Elliman Cons: Fancy Brand, Familiar Problems</h3>\n<p>As far as top real estate brokerage companies go, Douglas Elliman gets respect—but not without its share of classic big-brokerage baggage.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commission-Only Pay (and It’s Not Cheap to Stay)</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Like many traditional brokerages, Elliman is 100% commission-based—so you eat what you kill. Agents also say the splits and monthly fees are steep, making it tough to get ahead unless you’re already producing at a high level. <em>“There’s a price to pay for the resources,”</em> one review noted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Competitive &#038; Hierarchical Vibes</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Some offices feel like a team, others feel like high school—complete with cliques and top-producer favoritism. It’s a sink-or-swim environment where newer agents can easily feel sidelined.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Support Isn’t Always Consistent</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Support varies widely by office and manager. While some managers are all-in, others are checked out—and if you don’t speak up or push for help, you may be left to figure it all out on your own.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Outdated Tech and Clunky Tools</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Despite the brokerage’s luxury positioning, the technology doesn’t always match. Several agents called it outdated or non-intuitive, with too many disconnected systems and not enough streamlining.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Communication Gaps from the Top Down</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While some managers are praised, others leave agents feeling ignored. Reviews mention inconsistent support, unclear expectations, and office politics that get in the way of productivity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line? Douglas Elliman may be one of the top real estate brokers in the USA, but agents want the backend to match the brand. If you’re an experienced agent with a strong book of business and a taste for prestige, it could be a solid fit. But if you’re looking for hand-holding or innovation, don’t let the name fool you—it’s not always as polished behind the scenes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-agency-luxury-cool-but-bring-your-own-leads-and-maybe-a-therapist\">The Agency – Luxury Cool, But Bring Your Own Leads (and Maybe a Therapist)</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6daca5232666f109-The-Agency-Logo.webp/public\" alt=\"The Agency Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239652 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The Agency scores a strong 4.0 and the agent sentiment is sort of glowing—71% would recommend it to a friend, and 82% approve of the CEO.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The vibe here is sleek and supportive. Agents call out the collegial environment, solid CRM tools, marketing support, and a culture that feels more &#8220;work fam&#8221; than &#8220;corporate cult.&#8221; You get freedom and flexibility to build your business how you want—and if you’re already good at sales, this place can make you look (and feel) like a rockstar.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-agency-cons-great-vibe-but-youd-better-be-scrappy\">The Agency Cons: Great Vibe, but You’d Better Be Scrappy</h3>\n<p>Even with the fancy logo and good vibes, The Agency isn’t immune to the same issues that show up in <em>real estate agent reviews</em> across the board.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Stress and Cutthroat Competition</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Several reviews paint the job as a 24/7 hustle, with one calling it <em>“very stressful”</em>—not because of clients, but because of the pressure to constantly perform in a saturated market.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Management Drama and Favoritism</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Not every manager is a team player. Some agents complain about poor communication, rude leadership, and even shady lead distribution, which feels more like Hunger Games than high-end real estate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Quality Leads? Not Really a Thing Here</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Multiple reviews say leads are sparse—and when they do come, they’re low-budget rentals or dead-end deals. Agents feel like they’re stuck sourcing their own business, which kind of defeats the purpose of having &#8220;support.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Turnover and Team Instability</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Behind the polished brand, there’s high turnover, inconsistent systems, and what sounds like some internal shakeups. Great culture only goes so far if you&#8217;re constantly rebuilding teams or training new managers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, is The Agency one of the best real estate brokerages for high-performing agents who want a luxury brand behind them? Possibly—if you’re self-motivated, already have a pipeline, and don’t mind dodging the occasional internal chaos. But if you’re looking for hand-delivered leads and a team that’s got your back 24/7… the reviews say you might be chasing a dream, not a done deal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"century-21-family-vibes-franchise-fees-and-a-familiar-story\">Century 21 – Family Vibes, Franchise Fees, and a Familiar Story</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/03a1f58e09987743-Century-21-Realty-Logo.webp/public\" alt=\"Century 21 Realty Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239640 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Century 21 pulls in a solid 4.1 rating with 74% of agents saying they’d recommend it to a friend and a whopping 89% CEO approval rating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>New agents especially shout out the training, support, and family-style culture. The vibe? Welcoming. The systems? Robust. The brand recognition? Still strong in a lot of markets. If you’re looking for a brokerage that feels like a good first step into real estate—with some hand-holding and a flexible schedule—Century 21 delivers a solid starting point.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-century-21-cons-big-name-big-splits-and-some-outdated-baggage\">The Century 21 Cons: Big Name, Big Splits, and Some Outdated Baggage</h3>\n<p>Century 21 might bring the warm fuzzies, but it also brings the usual old-school brokerage problems. And the real estate agent reviews don’t hold back.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Fees and Splits</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents say the commission splits are steep, especially early on—and some question why they’re still paying franchise fees like it’s 2004. One agent even called it “expensive, but worth it”—which doesn’t exactly scream scalable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Tech That’s Trying Its Best</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The tools and backend systems are there, but agents say they feel clunky or outdated. Too many logins, slow support, and not enough tech-savviness compared to more modern brokerages.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Leads? You’re on Your Own.</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unless you’re on a team or in a high-volume office, don’t expect leads to rain from the sky. Several agents noted the lack of company-generated business—and a need for more long-term support in building client pipelines.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Work-Life Balance? Depends on Your Definition</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Real estate is demanding, sure—but agents here say the workload and weekend grind can make balance feel impossible. If you want your nights and weekends off, you might want to rethink.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So is Century 21 good for you? It depends. If you want structure, mentorship, and a company that still values relationship-building over buzzwords, it might be a good launchpad. But if you’re looking for modern tools, better splits, and lead generation support &#8211; legacy doesn’t always mean leverage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coldwell-banker-big-brand-big-tools-bring-your-own-patience\">Coldwell Banker – Big Brand, Big Tools… Bring Your Own Patience</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/7115600837c9a9d5-Caldwell-Banker-Logo.webp/public\" alt=\"Coldwell Banker Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239656 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Coldwell Banker scores a shiny 4.1 stars with 78% saying they’d recommend it to a friend and 86% giving the CEO a thumbs-up.

Training gets an A+, especially if you’re new and need someone to tell you what a CRM even is. The company also dishes out solid brand recognition, tons of marketing tools, and a flexible schedule that lets you decide when to hustle (or hide). The culture is consistently called out as supportive and collaborative, with enough experienced agents around to make it feel like you’re not totally winging it.</p>\n<p>The earning potential is there too—assuming you&#8217;re ready to work your tail off. It’s one of the <em>top real estate brokerage companies</em> for those who want big-league branding and have the drive to match.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coldwell-banker-cons-fees-leads-and-the-figure-it-out-method\">Coldwell Banker Cons: Fees, Leads, and the “Figure-It-Out” Method</h3>\n<p>Here’s where Coldwell Banker gets dinged:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fees That Feel a Bit&#8230; Much</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents repeatedly mention high desk fees and commission splits that don’t always feel justified—especially for new agents still figuring out how to unlock the office printer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>New Agents? Good Luck Out There.</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unless you’ve got a mentor lined up or a lead-generating sidekick, support for new agents is hit-or-miss, and leads aren’t exactly being handed out like open house flyers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Real Estate = Real Burnout</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While flexibility is praised, the reality is many agents feel overworked and on call 24/7, with weekends and evenings regularly sacrificed on the altar of client convenience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Starter Required</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You’ll hear it in nearly every <em>real estate brokerage review</em>: success here means being relentlessly self-motivated. If you’re waiting for a manager to swoop in and save you—you’ll be waiting a while.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if you’re looking for prestige, training, and access to a mega-brand name—check.

If you’re self-driven and love the idea of high commission potential (<em>95/5 splits, anyone?</em>), RE/MAX gives you the sandbox to build your empire. Just don’t expect anyone to bring the shovels—or the leads.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"re-max-cons-youre-the-boss-and-the-entire-payroll-department\">RE/MAX Cons: You’re the Boss… and the Entire Payroll Department</h3>\n<p>For all the love in the <em>real estate agent reviews</em>, there’s a healthy dose of “you’re on your own” energy too.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Fees, Big Bills</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents say the desk fees can be brutal, especially if you&#8217;re not on a top-tier plan. Between that and the splits, it’s not exactly a budget-friendly option for new agents finding their footing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Success Depends on You—and the Zip Code</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How well you do depends on your hustle and your geography.

And since it’s all about franchises, experiences vary wildly from office to office.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>New Agents, You’re on Thin Ice</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Reviews repeatedly mention that new agents don’t get much support—no leads, no real onboarding, no hand-holding.

Absolutely. But if you&#8217;re brand new and hoping someone will show you where the coffee is&#8230; well, good luck finding the break room.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"corcoran-polished-prestigious-and-priced-like-it\">Corcoran – Polished, Prestigious, and Priced Like It</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:16% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"138\" height=\"39\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/15ddff8b8957ea4b-Cororan-Logo-1.webp/public\" alt=\"Corcoran Logo\" class=\"wp-image-240841 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Clocking in at a shiny 4.3 stars, Corcoran is one of the <em>top-rated real estate brokerages in the US</em>—at least according to its own agents.

The franchise love doesn’t come cheap, and it’s easy to feel like you’re splitting your check five ways before you even cash it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Support? Only if You’re Already Crushing It</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The support starts off strong, but many agents report it fades fast. Once your onboarding hugs are over, you may be left searching for leads (or answers) on your own.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Too Many Tools, Not Enough Streamlining</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>BHHS gets an A+ for having <em>everything</em>. But it’s also a bit of a scavenger hunt. Tools, resources, websites, platforms—they’re scattered like a deck of cards at a toddler’s tea party.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A Little Too Competitive (and Clicky)</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It’s a competitive environment, and a few reviews hint at old-school hierarchies and the dreaded “good ol’ boys club” vibes. The vibe isn’t always inclusive, and agents feel it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, is Berkshire Hathaway one of the top 10 brokerage firms worth joining? If you’re organized, tech-savvy, and ready to make your own leads work harder than your commission split—yes. But if you’re expecting endless hand-holding and free leads, it may feel less like a financial powerhouse and more like a luxury label with an expensive price tag.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sothebys-luxury-brand-high-standards-and-youd-better-show-up-ready\">Sotheby’s – Luxury Brand, High Standards, and You’d Better Show Up Ready</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:16% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/122c6ecc7d7f2e8e-Sothebys-International-Realty-Logo.webp/public\" alt=\"Sotheby&#039;s International Realty Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239651 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Sotheby’s clocks in at a strong 4.3 rating where 74% would recommend it, and 89% give the CEO the thumbs up.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents love the global brand recognition, which comes with serious clout for landing luxury clients.

It’s not free. Agents mention steep commission splits and royalty fees, with one calling out the 6% branding tax as a bitter pill to swallow. Oh, and tack on hefty E&#038;O fees while you’re at it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Saturated Markets = Fierce Competition</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Want to break into luxury?

Your brokerage will also impact your day-to-day life, the support you receive, and the tools you can access to help grow your business. You want a place that fits your goals while making sure you keep as much of your earnings as possible.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing eXp Realty and Douglas Elliman. We’ll go over everything from commission splits and fees to the training and support each offers. And, take note, All of eXp Realty’s details are easy to find and transparent, not so with Douglas Elliman, we had to dig deeper. But don’t worry—we’ve done the research for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e998dad4c07b028a-Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Douglas Elliman: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s start by looking at how satisfied agents are with each brokerage. Based on Glassdoor reviews, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> leads the pack with a <strong>4.6-star</strong> <strong>rating</strong>, while <strong>Douglas Elliman</strong> comes in with a <strong>3.9-star rating</strong>. Agent satisfaction often reflects how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience.

Because if a brokerage is financially stable, it’s more likely to keep investing in its agents by offering better tools, more training, and stronger support. A struggling brokerage might start making decisions that hurt its agents, like cutting commissions or adding new fees.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about <strong>Douglas Elliman’s</strong> profitability. They’ve posted <strong>13 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>7 quarters of losses</strong>, meaning they have a <strong>46% profitability </strong>rate. Not the strongest track record.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with only 5 quarters of losses,—giving them a <strong>75% profitability</strong> rate. Even better<strong>, eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years.</strong></p>\n<p>That financial stability means <strong>continuous improvements</strong> for agents and clients without sudden changes that hurt your bottom line.

However, the caps seem to be anywhere from <strong>$21,000 &#8211; $30,000</strong> depending on the office. This wide variation makes it hard to predict exactly how much you’ll keep and how long it’ll take to cap, so make sure to ask for specifics during your interview.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, it’s straightforward and agent-friendly. Every agent starts with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission.</strong> Plus, eXp rewards agents with <strong>company stock</strong> for hitting certain milestones.</p>\n<p>If you meet additional goals after capping, you can even get your <strong>$16,000 cap back in stock</strong>. At the end of the year, these agents will have earned more than 100% of their commission.</p>\n<p>And with <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, every agent gets the same deal, whether you’re new to the game or a seasoned top producer. No negotiations are needed, and you know exactly what you’re getting from day one.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Douglas Elliman: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>When it comes to Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance, this is where the details matter. Unfortunately, <strong>Douglas Elliman</strong> doesn’t provide much information on this, and agents are told to <strong>check </strong>with their<strong> local offices</strong>. Depending on your location, these fees could be significant, so make sure to clarify before signing up.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the E&#038;O insurance is easy to understand. Agents only pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but once you hit <strong>$750 </strong>for the year, <strong>you’re done</strong>. No more E&#038;O payments, no matter how many deals you close. This is a great setup for agents who want to avoid heavy upfront costs and only pay when they’re actually making money.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Douglas Elliman: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really eat into your earnings, so let’s break down what each brokerage charges. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay a predictable <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and <strong>$25 per transaction</strong> until they hit their cap. It’s simple, straightforward, and budget-friendly.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Douglas Elliman</strong>, <strong>fees vary by office</strong>, and agents are also subject to a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> per transaction. This means you’re paying a percentage of every deal, which can quickly add up, especially when combined with office fees.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Douglas Elliman: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>When it comes to training and support, you need a brokerage that’s got your back, whether you’re just starting out or looking to take your business to the next level.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training and support are top-notch. They offer over <strong>50 live training sessions every week</strong>, plus an extensive <strong>on-demand course library</strong>. New agents can jump into the <strong>Fast Start</strong> <strong>program</strong>, designed to help them start earning quickly, while more experienced agents can benefit from <strong>Kick Start program</strong> to level up their business.</p>\n<p>On top of that, eXp provides <strong>24/7 support</strong> and has over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> ready to help out when you need it.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Douglas Elliman</strong>, <strong>training and support can vary widely</strong> depending on the office. Some locations might offer great resources, while others may not provide much at all. The inconsistency means that your experience could be very different depending on where you work.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Douglas Elliman: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In today’s real estate world, technology is critical, and having the right tools can make all the difference.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, technology is a strong point. eXp is a fully virtual brokerage, and everything is done online through <strong>eXp World</strong>—from broker meetings to training sessions to client collaboration. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>eXp Realty also provides agents with an <strong>IDX website</strong>, a <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> loaded with customizable templates, social media content, and much more. And the best part? eXp constantly updates and adds new tools to help agents stay ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>Douglas Elliman</strong>, we couldn’t find much concrete information about the tech they offer agents. While there may be resources available, it’s <strong>unclear</strong> if there’s a standard set of tools across all offices. If you rely heavily on cutting-edge technology to run your business, eXp Realty’s setup gives you a clear advantage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-douglas-elliman-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Douglas Elliman May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>If you’re someone who prefers a traditional brokerage model with physical offices and enjoys face-to-face interactions, then Douglas Elliman could be a better fit. They have a well-established reputation and strong branding. Plus, if having a local office broker there to make sure you’re staying on task, Douglas Elliman may be the right choice.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out-of-home office space, <strong>eXp Realty provides FREE access to the 4,000 Regus office business lounges</strong> around the world. But if you’re someone who thrives in a structured environment with a local broker checking in regularly, Douglas Elliman might offer the kind of setup that works best for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t provide. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, comparing <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> and Douglas Elliman comes down to your preferences.

Your brokerage affects everything from your day-to-day work experience to the level of support you’ll get, and how easily you can grow your business. Ultimately, you want a brokerage that fits your career goals and makes financial sense.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing eXp Realty and The Agency. We’ll look at their commission splits, fees, training, support, and what agents say about working there. And, note, that while eXp Realty is super transparent with its structure, The Agency operates in a more traditional way, where information isn’t always as clear. Don’t worry, we’ve done the digging for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e998dad4c07b028a-Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s start by looking at agent satisfaction—because happy agents tend to stick around longer and perform better. According to Glassdoor reviews, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands strong with a <strong>4.6 star rating</strong>, while <strong>The Agency</strong> isn’t far behind with <strong>4.1 star rating</strong>.</p>\n<p>These reviews give insight into how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience at each company.

Why should you care? Because a financially stable brokerage is more likely to invest in its agents, offering better tools, support, and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at <strong>The Agency</strong>. Unfortunately, <strong>they don’t have publicly listed stock</strong>, so their profitability isn’t transparent. This leaves you in the dark about how well the company is doing financially, which is something to keep in mind when considering the long-term stability of the brokerage.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>—meaning they’ve been <strong>profitable 75% of the time</strong>. Even better, <strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years</strong>.</p>\n<p>This financial stability translates into continuous improvements for both agents and clients, ensuring you have access to cutting-edge tools, tech, and support without worrying about surprise changes that could affect your income.

At <strong>The Agency</strong>, splits typically range from <strong>70/30</strong> to <strong>90/10.</strong> Like many traditional brokerages, it depends on the office and what deal you negotiate. So, you’ll want to ask about this when you’re interviewing.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, things are much simpler and transparent. Agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp offers additional stock options for agents who hit specific milestones—meaning you can actually earn <strong>more than 100% commission </strong>each year. For new agents or seasoned pros, everyone at eXp Realty gets the same deal, no haggling required.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is a must-have for protecting both agents and the brokerage from legal claims. Let’s see how the costs compare between eXp Realty and The Agency.</p>\n<p>At <strong>The Agency</strong>, agents are charged <strong>$1,900</strong> <strong>annually</strong> for E&#038;O insurance, and from what we’ve gathered, this fee is often due upfront, even before you’ve closed any deals.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the E&#038;O insurance structure is more agent-friendly. Agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and once you hit <strong>$750</strong> in total for the year, you don’t pay anything more—no matter how many deals you close.</p>\n<p>This setup is much easier on your budget, especially if you’re just starting out and don’t want to pay hefty fees before making any money.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really take a bite out of your earnings, so let’s break down the costs at eXp Realty and The Agency. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, you’ll pay a manageable <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong>, plus a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until you hit your cap. That’s it—clear and simple.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>The Agency</strong> has fees that <strong>vary by office</strong>. Monthly fees can fluctuate significantly, and on top of that, there’s a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> charged on each transaction. These fees can add up quickly, especially when combined with commission splits, so make sure to ask about the specifics at your local office.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>training</strong> and <strong>support</strong>, the quality and availability can make a huge difference in your career, whether you’re a brand-new agent or a seasoned pro.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> excels in this area, offering more than <strong>50 live training sessions each week</strong>, along with a robust <strong>on-demand course library</strong>.</p>\n<p>For new agents, the <strong>Fast Start</strong> <strong>program</strong> helps you get up to speed quickly, while the <strong>Kick Start</strong> <strong>program</strong> is designed to take experienced agents to the next level. Plus, eXp Realty offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> available to help when you need it.</p>\n<p>At <strong>The Agency</strong>, training and support <strong>vary by office</strong>. Some locations offer more resources than others, but there’s no consistent standard.</p>\n<p>The same goes for support—your experience will largely <strong>depend on your local broker’s availability</strong>, which can be a drawback if you need help outside of regular business hours. If reliable, around-the-clock support is important to you, eXp Realty has a significant edge.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Technology can make a big difference in how efficiently you can run your real estate business, so let’s see what each brokerage offers.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out with its fully virtual brokerage model, which includes <strong>eXp World</strong>—a metaverse-like platform where agents can meet with brokers, get tech support, attend training, and collaborate with other agents, all from the comfort of their home. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Beyond that, eXp Realty provides agents with a <strong>personal IDX website</strong>, <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> packed with customizable templates and social media content. And eXp Realty is always updating its tech to stay ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p>As for <strong>The Agency</strong>, there isn’t a lot of information about their tech offerings. So ask at your local office.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-the-agency-may-be-best-for-you\">Why The Agency May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>While<a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> eXp Realty</a> has plenty to offer, The Agency could still be the right fit for agents who prefer a traditional brokerage with physical offices. If you’re someone who thrives on in-person interactions and prefers having an office broker keep tabs on your productivity, The Agency might feel more like home.</p>\n<p>If you’re simply looking for out-of-home office space, <strong>eXp Realty offers FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide</strong>. However, if you prefer a structured environment with a local broker checking in daily, The Agency might suit your style better.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t provide. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry. And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp.</p>\n<p>The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>In the end, the decision between <strong>eXp Realty</strong> and <strong>The Agency</strong> comes down to what you’re looking for in a brokerage. <strong>The Agency</strong> offers a more traditional experience with physical offices and in-person support, but higher fees and inconsistent training could be downsides.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out with <strong>transparent splits</strong>, lower fees, advanced tech, and <strong>24/7 support</strong>—making it a strong option for agents who want flexibility, growth potential, and the ability to keep more of their commissions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Your brokerage choice shapes your everyday experience, the support you receive, and the resources available to grow your business.</p>\n<p>You want a brokerage that aligns with your goals, supports your success, helps you keep more of your hard-earned money and, of course, leaves you feeling super stoked about your choice.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing eXp Realty and <a href=\"https://www.bhhs.com/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices</a>—two well-known names in real estate. We’ll take a close look at commission splits, fees, training opportunities, and agent satisfaction.</p>\n<p>eXp <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/about-exp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> is super transparent about this information, but it takes digging to fully understand what Berkshire Hathaway offers. Luckily for you, we’ve done the research, so you don’t have to.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e998dad4c07b028a-Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s start with agent satisfaction—because if agents are happy, they’re more likely to succeed. Based on Glassdoor reviews, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> scores a solid <strong>4.6 stars</strong>, while <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> comes in slightly lower at <strong>4.4 stars</strong>.</p>\n<p>This gives you a peek into how agents feel about their overall experience at each company, including support and resources.

A financially stable brokerage is less likely to make sudden changes that could hurt your business.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is one of the many companies under the <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Berkshire Hathaway umbrella</a>. However, we can’t find any broken out financial performance of the HomeServices division in Berkshire Hathaway’s public filings. So while Berkshire Hathaway as a whole is profitable, we don’t know whether HomeServices itself is generating a profit or running at a loss.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 15 profitable quarters, putting them at <strong>75% profitability</strong>. And even better—<strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years.</strong></p>\n<p>That kind of financial stability leads to continuous improvements for agents and clients alike.

At Berkshire Hathaway, commission splits range from 60/40 to 93/7. This is often negotiated between the agent and office, so it’s important to ask for specifics during your interview.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the commission splits are refreshingly simple and transparent. Agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>And with eXp, there’s no negotiation or confusion—every agent gets the same deal. Plus, eXp offers stock options for agents who hit certain milestones, so you can actually earn <strong>more than 100%</strong> of your commissions each year. Whether you’re a new agent or a top producer, the playing field is level at eXp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Now let’s talk about <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/errors-omissions-eo-insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance</a>. This is crucial for protecting both you and your brokerage from potential legal claims.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, the details about E&#038;O insurance are not widely shared, and it seems to <strong>vary by office</strong>. From what we’ve gathered, these costs can be substantial, so you’ll want to check with your local office to understand what you’ll be expected to pay.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and once you hit <strong>$750</strong> for the year, your E&#038;O fees stop. No more payments, no matter how many deals you close. This is a huge advantage, especially if you’re just starting out or want to keep more of your income in your pocket.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really add up, so let’s break down what to expect from eXp Realty and Berkshire Hathaway. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay a straightforward <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong>, and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until you hit your cap. Pretty simple, right?</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, things are more complicated. Monthly fees can range from <strong>$295 to</strong> <strong>$625</strong> per transaction, depending on your office. Plus, there’s a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> on each transaction, which can really start to add up. When you compare the two, eXp Realty offers a more predictable and cost-effective fee structure, which helps agents keep more of their earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Training and support are key for both new agents and seasoned pros. Let’s see how these brokerages stack up. At <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/training\">eXp Realty</a>, you’ll have access to over 50 live training sessions every week, along with a massive on-demand library of courses.</p>\n<p>For new agents, the <strong>Fast Start program</strong> is designed to help you hit the ground running, while experienced agents can level up with the <strong>Kick Start program</strong>. And with <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff</strong> members available to assist you, you’re never left hanging when you need help.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, the training and support<strong> vary by office</strong>. Some offices might offer great resources, while others could leave you wanting more. Your experience will largely depend on your local office broker’s availability, which means you might not always have the support you need at crucial moments.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Having the right technology can make or break your real estate business, so let’s see how eXp Realty and Berkshire Hathaway compare.</p>\n<p>eXp Realty is at the forefront of tech innovation with its fully virtual brokerage model. Agents work in eXp World, a metaverse-like platform where you can meet with brokers, get tech support, and attend training sessions. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/exp-world\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp Realty provides agents with a personal <strong>IDX website</strong>, not just a page on your brokerage’s website, a powerful <strong>CRM &#038; Lead Generator Tool</strong>, a <strong>Marketing Center</strong> filled with customizable templates and social media content, and more. And with eXp, the tech keeps evolving to help you stay ahead of the competition.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, we found <strong>no information</strong> about their technology and resources. Not sure why, but it seems like a bad thing that no one is talking about it. If having access to cutting-edge tools and resources is crucial to your success, eXp Realty is the clear leader here.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-berkshire-hathaway-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Berkshire Hathaway May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>While eXp Realty offers tons of benefits, Berkshire Hathaway may be the better fit if you prefer a traditional brokerage with physical offices. If you enjoy the structure of an office environment or need to have a local broker for face-to-face support and to crack the whip to get you moving, Berkshire Hathaway could be the right place for you.</p>\n<p>But if you’re just looking for out-of-home office space, eXp Realty provides FREE access to over <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/offices\">4,000 Regus office business lounges</a> around the world. But if you thrive in a more structured setting with daily in-person accountability, Berkshire Hathaway might feel more like home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>On top of everything else, eXp Realty offers a range of features that most other brokerages simply don’t. For luxury agents, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/luxury\">eXp’s Luxury Division </a>allows you to advertise your high-end listings globally, giving you top-tier exposure.</p>\n<p>They also have a dedicated staff called<a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenous-leads\"> Revenos</a>, whose sole job is to find and provide quality leads directly to eXp agents—how cool is that? Their Referral tool makes it easy for agents to pass referrals to others with just a few clicks, and if you’re only interested in running a referral business, eXp’s Referral Division lowers costs while keeping you in the game.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget about <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share\">Revenue Share</a>, which offers agents a way to earn income by recommending other agents to join eXp. That income doesn’t stop when you retire and it’s willable, meaning it keeps giving even after you’re out of the game. Talk about a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>When it comes to choosing between <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>eXp Realty</strong></a> and <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, it really depends on what you’re looking for in a brokerage. <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> offers the traditional, in-office experience with a solid reputation, but with higher fees and inconsistent training.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> gives you <strong>transparent splits</strong>, lower fees, cutting-edge tech, and <strong>24/7 support</strong>—making it a fantastic option for agents looking for flexibility, growth, and the chance to keep more of their hard-earned commissions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Smart Agent Alliance: The Sponsor Team That Works for Your Revenue Share</h2>\n<p>Most agents don’t join eXp for the <a href=\"https://cthulhu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/karrie_karriehill_com/Documents/Desktop/SAA%20Share/SAA%20Blogs/Revenue%20share%202.0:%20https:/smartagentalliance.com/about-exp-realty/revenue-share/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revenue share</a> passive income, but once they see the potential, they wish they had our resources and support.

But your brokerage also shapes your day-to-day experience, determines how much support you get, and dictates the resources you can access to grow your business. You need to choose a brokerage that helps you succeed while ensuring your bottom line stays healthy.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing eXp Realty and Coldwell Banker—two prominent names in real estate. We’ll explore everything from commission splits and fees to the level of training and agent satisfaction at each brokerage.</p>\n<p>With eXp Realty, all the information is easily accessible, but with Coldwell Banker, we had to do some digging to find out what agents experience. No worries, we’ve got you covered.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e998dad4c07b028a-Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s start by looking at how happy agents are at both brokerages. According to Glassdoor, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands strong with a <strong>4.6-star rating</strong>, while <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> also holds up well with a <strong>4.3-star rating</strong>. These ratings give a snapshot of how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience at each company.</p>\n<p>And as we all know, agents who are satisfied with their brokerage tend to be more successful.  If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a37cf1e2cc5b6038-Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why should you care if your brokerage is making money? Because a profitable brokerage has the financial stability to offer better tools, resources, and fewer surprise changes that could hurt you or your clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> is part of Anywhere Real Estate, which also owns big names like Sotheby’s, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Century 21, and Corcoran. Anywhere has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 8 unprofitable quarters. That gives it a <strong>60% profitability</strong> rate—not bad, but there’s definitely room for improvement.</p>\n<p>Now let’s look at <strong>eXp Realty</strong>. They’ve posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, and 15 of those have been profitable, giving them a <strong>75% profitability</strong> rate. What’s more, eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable over the past five years.</p>\n<p>That stability translates to continuous improvements for both agents and clients. When you work at a brokerage that’s making money, they can afford to reinvest in their agents with better tools, training, and tech.

Our research shows that the actual numbers vary a lot, so make sure to ask for specifics when you interview.</p>\n<p>Now, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is refreshingly simple. Every agent starts at an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000 to eXp</strong> in the year, you cap, meaning you keep <strong>100% </strong>of your commissions after that. There’s no negotiating for a better split—every agent gets the same deal, whether you’re new or a seasoned pro.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp offers opportunities to <strong>earn stock</strong>. You get company stock for hitting certain milestones, and if you hit additional goals after capping, you can earn your <strong>$16,000 cap back in stock</strong>. That’s how some agents actually earn more than 100% of their commission each year. Nice!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is a must-have for agents, but how brokerages handle this cost varies. At <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong>, agents pay around <strong>$300 per month</strong> for E&#038;O insurance. Whether that’s upfront or paid over time depends on the office, but that’s a significant cost no matter how you slice it.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, E&#038;O insurance is a lot more manageable. Agents only pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and eXp caps those fees at <strong>$750</strong> annually. So once you’ve paid $750 in E&#038;O for the year, you’re done. You won’t have to pay another penny, no matter how many deals you close. That’s a huge benefit for agents who are just getting started and don’t want to be burdened with hefty upfront costs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees are another critical consideration, and Coldwell Banker and eXp Realty handle them quite differently.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the fee structure is straightforward. Agents pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and <strong>$25 per transaction</strong> until they hit their cap. It’s predictable, easy to understand, and there are no surprises.</p>\n<p><strong>Coldwell Banker’s</strong> fees, however, vary greatly depending on the office. Agents can expect to pay between <strong>$122 &#8211; $350 per month</strong> just to stay on board, and there’s also a <strong>5% to 6.5% royalty fee</strong> charged per transaction. These fees can really add up and take a bigger chunk out of your earnings compared to <strong>eXp’s</strong> much simpler structure.</p>\n<p>Between the clear fee structure at eXp and the variable, sometimes high, costs at Coldwell Banker, eXp Realty definitely offers a more agent-friendly deal when it comes to fees.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Next up is training and support, which are crucial to helping agents, whether new or experienced, succeed.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training opportunities are top-notch. With over <strong>50 live training sessions every week</strong>, plus a full library of <strong>on-demand courses</strong>, there’s always something to help you improve. eXp also has programs like <strong>Fast Start</strong> for new agents who want to get going fast, and <strong>Kick Start</strong> for experienced agents looking to take their business to the next level.</p>\n<p>On top of all that, eXp provides <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> to assist you with your needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Coldwell Banker</strong>, on the other hand, <strong>doesn’t offer a standardized training program</strong> across all offices. Training varies depending on where you’re located and what your office offers. That’s also true for agent support—it’s heavily reliant on the office broker, meaning your experience can vary depending on how available or helpful your broker is.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to tech, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out from the crowd. They’ve built a fully virtual brokerage, and agents can do everything from meeting with brokers to attending training sessions in <strong>eXp World</strong>, their online metaverse-style platform. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Beyond that, eXp agents get access to an <strong>IDX website</strong>, a <strong>CRM</strong> called <strong>kvCORE</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> with customizable templates, social media content, and more. eXp is constantly adding new tech tools to help agents stay ahead of the game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we couldn’t dig up too much information about what <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> offers in terms of tech. It’s <strong>unclear if they have any standard tools </strong>across offices, so ask about that during your Coldwell Banker interview.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-coldwell-banker-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Coldwell Banker May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>If you’re someone who likes a more traditional office environment with face-to-face interactions and you prefer having a local office broker for day-to-day support, Coldwell Banker could be a better fit. They’ve got a long-standing reputation and strong branding, and for some agents, having that in-person accountability is key to their success.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out-of-home office space, <strong>eXp Realty provides FREE access to the 4,000 Regus office business lounges</strong> around the world. But that won’t be enough if you’re someone who needs the structure of a physical office, with a broker cracking the whip. If that’s the case, Coldwell Banker might feel more like home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t provide. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, when comparing eXp Realty and Coldwell Banker, it comes down to what kind of environment you thrive in. Coldwell Banker has the prestige of a traditional office setting, but with higher fees and less predictable splits, it might not be the most cost-effective option.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, eXp Realty offers transparent splits, lower fees, better tech, and 24/7 support—all of which can help you keep more of your earnings and grow your business faster.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

You want a brokerage that matches your style, helps you grow, and—let’s be real—puts more money in your pocket.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re going to explore eXp Realty and Redfin. These are two very different models. We’ll break down everything from commission splits and fees to agent satisfaction and profitability.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e998dad4c07b028a-Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is key to knowing how supported you’ll feel at a brokerage. According to Glassdoor, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> scores an impressive <strong>4.6 stars</strong>, while <strong>Redfin</strong> comes in at <strong>4.2 stars</strong>. Agent satisfaction often reflects the level of support, resources, and overall agent experience. And we know that when agents are happy, they’re more likely to succeed.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a37cf1e2cc5b6038-Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why should you care about brokerage profitability? Because when a brokerage is profitable, it’s more likely to invest in its agents—offering better tools, support, and training.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at <strong>Redfin</strong>. With <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, Redfin has posted <strong>17 quarters of losses</strong>, meaning they’ve only had <strong>15% profitability </strong>rate. Ouch. Financial instability like that often leads to cost-cutting measures that can hurt agents and their clients.</p>\n<p>In comparison, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with only <strong>5 quarters of losses</strong>, which gives them a <strong>75% profitability </strong>rate. And get this—<strong>eXp Realty</strong> is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the past five years.</p>\n<p>That kind of financial strength is a big deal because it means continuous improvements for both agents and clients, without cutting corners.

You can choose an <strong>up to 40/60 </strong>split and Redfin will provide your leads or an <strong>up to 75/25 </strong>split and you find your own leads.</p>\n<p>It’s unclear what situation results in a lower pay than 40/60 and 75/25, but clearly the words “up to” imply their splits can be lower. Anyway, these splits are fairly new as Redfin recently ended their model that paid agent salaries. We’re guessing Redfin’s low profitability motivated the change.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, it’s straightforward. Every agent starts with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Plus, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> rewards agents with stock for hitting certain milestones, and if you meet additional goals, you can even get your <strong>$16,000 cap back in company stock</strong>. That means agents can earn <strong>more than 100% commission</strong> each year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Fees</h2>\n<p><strong>Fees</strong> can eat into your earnings if you’re not careful, so let’s compare how they stack up between these two brokerages.</p>\n<p><strong>Redfin</strong> takes a different approach. Redfin takes a <strong>bigger bite out of your commission</strong> and covers your fees and some other business expenses that agents typically incur like MLS dues, association fees, mileage, cell phone plan, training, development, sales coaching, and more.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, you pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until you hit your cap. For E&#038;O insurance, you pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but only when you close a deal. And here’s the best part—once you hit <strong>$750</strong> for the year, you’re done paying E&#038;O insurance.</p>\n<p>While eXp Realty does not cover all the fees that Redfin does, having a 80/20 split that goes up to 100% when you cap instead of Redfin’s much lower splits leaves agents taking home more money. Plus, eXp agents do get all the training, development, sales coaching they could possibly need at no additional fee.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re just starting out or a seasoned pro, training and support are crucial to your success. Let’s see what each brokerage offers in this department.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents have access to <strong>50+ live training sessions every week</strong>, an <strong>on-demand library</strong>, and programs like <strong>Fast Start</strong> for new agents and <strong>Kick Start</strong> for experienced agents. Plus, you get <strong>24/7 support</strong> and help from over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong>. That’s a huge bonus because it means you’re never left hanging when you need help.</p>\n<p><strong>Redfin</strong> offers <strong>4 weeks of local training</strong>, which is a decent start for new agents. However, beyond that initial training, the level of <strong>support varies</strong> depending on the office broker. So, if you need help outside of standard hours or want more ongoing training, you might find yourself waiting for someone to be available.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In today’s real estate world, having the right tech can make or break your business. Let’s see how these two brokerages stack up in terms of technology and resources.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> is known for being a fully virtual brokerage. With <strong>eXp World</strong>, agents can meet with their brokers, get tech support, attend training, and collaborate with other agents—all in a metaverse-style environment. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p> On top of that, eXp Realty provides agents with their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a powerful <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> with customizable templates for social media, flyers, and so much more.</p>\n<p>The details on <strong>Redfin</strong>’s technology and resources are a bit harder to come by. They’re known for their <strong>consumer-facing website</strong>, which is popular with buyers and sellers, but when it comes to tools for agents, it’s not as clear. There’s no virtual platform like eXp World, so if cutting-edge tech is something you value, eXp Realty is the better choice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-redfin-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Redfin May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>While eXp Realty offers a ton of value, Redfin still has its appeal, especially if you’re someone who values stability and enjoys a more traditional real estate model.</p>\n<p>Redfin’s salary option offers consistency that might be appealing to agents who want a guaranteed paycheck, even if it comes with a lower commission split. Plus, if you prefer working in a more structured environment, where someone is in charge of keeping you on track, Redfin’s office-based approach could be a better fit for you.</p>\n<p>That said, <strong>eXp Realty does provide FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide.</strong> But if you thrive on having a salaried position with a traditional brokerage structure, Redfin might be the better option for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248129\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b429496776d48dc3-eXps-Exclusive-Resources.png/public\" alt=\"a yellow diamond on a white background\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources.png 256w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t have. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry. And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working.

On Glassdoor, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds a solid <strong>4.6-star rating</strong>, while <strong>Century 21</strong> comes in at <strong>4.2 stars</strong>.</p>\n<p>Agent reviews often reflect how much support they’re getting, the resources available, and whether the brokerage sets them up for success.

Because a brokerage that’s financially stable is less likely to make cuts that could hurt you or your clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Century 21</strong> is part of Anywhere Real Estate, which also includes Sotheby’s, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Berkshire Hathaway, and Corcoran. Anywhere has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 12 quarters of profits, so they’ve been <strong>profitable 60% </strong>of the time.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong>, on the other hand, has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 15 quarters of profits, meaning they’ve been <strong>profitable 75% </strong>of the time. And <strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years.</strong> This financial stability leads to consistent improvements for agents and clients alike.</p>\n<p>So if you’re looking for a brokerage that’s not only growing but also reinvesting in its agents, eXp Realty is the clear winner.

At <strong>Century 21</strong>, commission splits range from <strong>70/30</strong> to <strong>92/8</strong>, and some offices may offer a cap, typically around <strong>$22,500</strong>, but you’ll need to check with your local office because, like many traditional brokerages, the split can vary depending on the office and the deal you negotiate.</p>\n<p>Over at <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the splits are straightforward. Every agent starts with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp Realty rewards agents with stock for hitting certain milestones, so you can earn even <strong>more than 100%.</strong> And what’s great is that eXp Realty offers the same split to every agent, no matter where you’re located—no haggling or mystery. It’s just transparent and fair across the board.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Century 21: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Next up, Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance—a must-have for every agent, as it protects both you and your brokerage from potential legal claims.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Century 21</strong>, the details about E&#038;O insurance are <strong>not readily available</strong>, and costs can vary significantly by office. It’s best to check with your local office since these fees can sometimes be pretty hefty.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the E&#038;O insurance is predictable. Agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$750</strong> for the year, you’re done. After that, no more E&#038;O fees for the rest of the year, no matter how many deals you close. This is a huge advantage, especially if you’re just starting out and don’t want to deal with high upfront costs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Century 21: Fees</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about <strong>fees</strong>—because we all know they can eat into your bottom line if you’re not careful.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the fees are simple and predictable. Agents pay a <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> until they cap. Super straightforward.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Century 21</strong>, the fees are more varied. Depending on the office, agents could pay anywhere from <strong>$0 to $350</strong> per month, plus there’s a <strong>6% to 7% royalty fee</strong> due per transaction. In some cases, agents are still required to pay that royalty fee even after capping.</p>\n<p>Plus, there are <strong>$499</strong> transaction fees in some locations. You’ll need to check with your local office for the exact numbers, but overall, <strong>Century 21’s</strong> fees can add up faster than you might expect.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Century 21: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re new or experienced, training and support are essential to your success.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, you’ve got access to <strong>50+ live training sessions</strong> every week, as well as an entire <strong>on-demand library of courses</strong>. New agents can benefit from the <strong>Fast Start</strong> <strong>program</strong>, while experienced agents can level up with the <strong>Kick Start program</strong>. And if you ever need help, eXp Realty offers <strong>24/7 support </strong>and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff </strong>members ready to assist.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Century 21</strong>, the training and support <strong>vary greatly by office</strong>. Some locations offer solid resources, while others might leave you wanting more. Your level of support really depends on how involved your local broker is, and the training is often up to the individual office.</p>\n<p>If consistent, high-quality training and 24/7 support are important to you, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> comes out on top.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Century 21: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Having the right tools can make all the difference in your real estate career, so let’s look at what these brokerages offer in terms of <strong>technology</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> leads the charge in tech innovation. With a fully virtual brokerage model, agents work in <strong>eXp World</strong>, a metaverse-like platform where you can meet with your broker, attend trainings, and get tech support.

If you’re someone who prefers a more traditional brokerage experience, with physical offices and a broker that helps keep you on track, then Century 21 could be what you’re looking for.</p>\n<p>But, if your attraction to an office is just because you want out of your house, eXp Realty does provide <strong>FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges</strong> <strong>around the globe</strong>. Still, if you need that in-person accountability and thrive in a structured office setting, <strong>Century 21</strong> might suit your style better.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond all the usual perks, eXp Realty brings some truly standout features that most other brokerages just can’t match. If you work in the luxury market, eXp’s<strong> Luxury Division</strong> gives your high-end listings global exposure, putting them in front of the right audience worldwide.</p>\n<p>They’ve also got a team called <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose whole job is to find and deliver quality leads straight to eXp agents—pretty awesome, right?</p>\n<p>Their <strong>Referral tool</strong> makes sending referrals to other agents a breeze, and for those who want to focus solely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> helps cut costs while keeping you in the business.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, where you can earn extra income by simply recommending agents to join eXp.

If you&#8217;re not telling your brand story clearly, you&#8217;re just another face in the crowd. Make sure you&#8217;re shouting from the rooftops—well, websites and social media—what makes you the go-to agent.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just about logos and colors; it’s about weaving your unique promise into every post and page.

If your online voice keeps changing, it&#8217;s like wearing a disguise every time you meet someone.

And don’t forget, a lot of your potential clients are scrolling on their smartphones, so make sure your site looks great and functions smoothly on mobile devices too. Keep your blog fresh and filled with keyword-rich <a href=\"/the-ultimate-guide-to-crafting-a-real-estate-agent-newsletter\">real estate articles</a> to pull in more traffic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"web-design-woes\">Web Design Woes</h3>\n<p>Your website is like your <strong>online open house</strong>. Make sure it’s inviting and easy to navigate so visitors can find exactly what they need without hassle. Every page should guide them on what to do next, whether it’s calling for more info or signing up for your newsletter. Website speed is also key— a slow-loading site could make visitors bounce faster than you can say “new listing!”</p>\n<h3 id=\"underused-video-content\">Underused Video Content</h3>\n<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video must be <strong>priceless</strong>! Boost your listings with video tours to draw in buyers. Consider tapping into the power of live video on social media to engage with potential clients in real-time.</p>\n<p>Also, create helpful explainer videos for buyers and sellers to demystify the real estate process. For that, make a list of what you find yourself explaining over and over again. Customers will value your efforts, and, hey, you’ll save loads of time by not needing to constantly repeat that information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-social-media-marketing-flaws\">8. Social Media Marketing Flaws</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_241975\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-241975\" style=\"width: 990px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241975\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/943f801f7891ec49-Social-Media-Marketing-Flaws.webp/public\" alt=\"Person interacting with social media icons on a smartphone, illustrating real estate agent marketing mistakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"242\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social-Media-Marketing-Flaws.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social-Media-Marketing-Flaws-300x73.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social-Media-Marketing-Flaws-768x186.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-241975\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Understanding common social media marketing mistakes can help real estate agents improve their online presence and engagement.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get into two super common social media real estate agent marketing mistakes that you must avoid.</p>\n<h3 id=\"quantity-vs-quality\">Quantity vs Quality</h3>\n<p>One mistake is <strong>preferring volume over value</strong> in your marketing efforts. Here’s a tip: flooding your audience with constant posts isn&#8217;t as effective as sharing genuinely impactful content intermittently.</p>\n<p>I know! We’re all trained to believe that more content is better. We fear that algorithms won’t reward our content if we aren’t putting out tons of content.</p>\n<p>But, that’s not the case. Focus on crafting content that truly resonates—like detailed guides that answer the big questions for buyers and sellers. This type of content sticks in their minds and is more likely to be shared, amplifying your reach organically.</p>\n<p>Of course, the proof is in the pudding. Always measure your efforts by tracking the return on investment (ROI). This ensures your marketing isn&#8217;t just busy work, but is genuinely building your business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"forgetting-audience-engagement\">Forgetting Audience Engagement</h3>\n<p>Now let’s jump to a classic real estate agent marketing mistake: neglecting audience engagement. I know, it can be tough. Sometimes finding your audience’s comments takes some effort because not every platform is easy to navigate. Also, sometimes the comments are negative or full of vendors wanting to sell you their wares.</p>\n<p>But, it’s important to take the time to find and read your audience’s comments and respond promptly. Turn all interactions into an opportunity to get to know the commenter and move your business forward. Here are some tips on how to make all engagement useful:</p>\n<h4 id=\"genuine-customer-comments\">Genuine Customer Comments</h4>\n<p>This is why you’re providing content. It’s what’s what you want to see. Take the time needed to respond to potential client comments thoughtfully. Craft a lengthier comment if that’s what the comment deserves. Ask questions to keep the engagement going.</p>\n<h4 id=\"haters\">Haters</h4>\n<p>Yep, eventually, we all get these. You know, those people who just can’t resist throwing out some unsolicited negativity. Don’t fear these comments or delete them. Instead, respond professionally to demonstrate who you are to your “real” prospects and to extend the engagement for algorithms to pick up and reward.</p>\n<h4 id=\"vendors\">Vendors</h4>\n<p>Yep, even those trying to sell you something can boost your algorithm gold stars. Engage with them. And here&#8217;s a little secret: your engagement can be more than just saying you’re not interested. Ask them how they specifically plan to help you. You might pick up a useful tip or two.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, no matter what type of comment, engagement shows you’re attentive and caring boosts your brand’s human touch. By avoiding this common real estate agent marketing mistake, you&#8217;ll forge deeper connections that are more likely to convert into lasting client relationships.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-overlooking-customer-insights\">7. Overlooking Customer Insights</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_241980\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-241980\" style=\"width: 990px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241980\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/1306820ffec80335-Overlooking-Customer-Insights.webp/public\" alt=\"A bright light bulb standing out among dim bulbs, representing the importance of not overlooking customer insights in real estate agent marketing mistakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"304\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Overlooking-Customer-Insights.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Overlooking-Customer-Insights-300x91.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Overlooking-Customer-Insights-768x233.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-241980\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Recognizing and acting on customer insights can drastically improve real estate marketing effectiveness.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One of the big real estate agent marketing mistakes is ignoring the <strong>gold mine found in customer feedback</strong>. When clients offer advice, smart agents don’t just listen. They act. Implementing client feedback, even minor suggestions, can drastically refine your approach.</p>\n<p>How do you get the feedback? Consider a survey after a deal. Encourage your clients to share their opinions on anything that could improve future client experiences. Let them know you&#8217;re genuinely interested in their feedback.</p>\n<p>If you have a social media presence, use the feedback you already have at your fingertips &#8211; your analytics. You know, all that free information sitting in our accounts that we rarely look at? Review it now because those analytics offer insights into what works. Focus on which posts resonate the most and use this data to shape your content strategy.</p>\n<p>Now for the frosting on the cake! Make changes based on what you learn and tell your clients and potential clients about it! Sharing how you’ve evolved your services based on client input demonstrates responsiveness and underscores your dedication to client satisfaction. That’s some good optics!</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-missed-opportunities-to-retarget\">6. Missed Opportunities to Retarget</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_241979\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-241979\" style=\"width: 990px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241979\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/c9e2bcb558a2ce27-Missed-Opportunities-to-Retarget.webp/public\" alt=\"Red dart hitting the bullseye on a dartboard, representing the importance of retargeting in real estate agent marketing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"261\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Missed-Opportunities-to-Retarget.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Missed-Opportunities-to-Retarget-300x78.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Missed-Opportunities-to-Retarget-768x200.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-241979\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Don’t miss out on retargeting opportunities.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another major real estate agent marketing mistake is missing opportunities to retarget. Don&#8217;t let potential clients <strong>slip through the cracks</strong>! You’ve already done the work coming up with great ads. Retargeting those ads is a fantastic way to reel back those who visited your site but left without engaging.</p>\n<p>One effective way to do this is through Facebook&#8217;s pixel-based ads, which track visitors and show them relevant ads later. For example, if a visitor browses a property listing, a retargeting ad can remind them of that listing, keeping your services top of mind.</p>\n<p>Creating list-based retargeting ads can also be effective. Uploading a list of potential leads to Facebook lets you target ads directly to those users, increasing the chance they’ll come back (Constant Contact). Regularly track and adjust your retargeting strategy to ensure it&#8217;s effective, and consider setting up A/B tests to see which ads perform best</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-ineffective-data-management\">5. Ineffective Data Management</h2>\n<p>A robust <strong>CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool</strong> isn&#8217;t just helpful; it&#8217;s critical. Using a CRM helps keep track of all your leads and your interactions with those leads, all in one place. This ensures you don’t miss any opportunities.</p>\n<p>As all working agents know, managing prospect and client information and interactions without a CRM becomes downright chaotic. That leads to missed follow-ups and lost sales.</p>\n<p>And, remember, regularly clean your data by removing outdated or incorrect information to keep your database accurate. Outdated data wastes your time and effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-sales-overdrive\">4. Sales Overdrive</h2>\n<p>Let’s get real. Sometimes, in the <strong>rush to get a client</strong>, you might come off a bit too strong. That eager beaver act? That’s a real estate agent marketing mistake that can scare off potential clients.</p>\n<p>Instead of going full throttle on the sales pitch, focus on building trust first. Do that by showcasing testimonials in all your marketing. Create a title for your happy client comments so that new potential clients can easily scan for what’s most important to them.</p>\n<p>For example, these are some titles to go with the testimonial that follows it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attentive and Supportive</strong>: My agent was attentive throughout the entire home-buying process. It seemed she wasn’t just about closing a deal, she was part of the journey with us.</li>\n<li><strong>Navigating Competitive Markets</strong>: Our agent found a hidden gem in a competitive market and negotiated the price down by 5%.</li>\n<li><strong>Stress-Free Selling</strong>: My agent’s compassion and expertise took the stress out of selling my family home.</li>\n<li><strong>First-Time Buyer Success</strong>: My agent patiently explained every step of the process and was always available to answer questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By showcasing client satisfaction and successful outcomes, you create a relatable and reassuring image that attracts more clients naturally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-slow-engagement-response\">3. Slow Engagement Response</h2>\n<p><strong>Yes, speed is everything</strong> in prospect and client communications! Monitor your messages and emails closely and respond as quickly as possible. Fast replies demonstrate your commitment to excellent customer service. Slow replies tell clients that you are too busy to meet their needs.</p>\n<p>What if you can’t always keep a close eye out? Consider setting up carefully crafted automated responses for common inquiries to ensure potential clients get answers promptly. This keeps them less likely to look for a prompt response elsewhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-setting-unrealistic-goals\">2. Setting Unrealistic Goals</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_241981\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-241981\" style=\"width: 990px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-241981\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/817f367f8280afa0-Setting-Unrealistic-Goals.webp/public\" alt=\"Person climbing a rocky hill, representing the challenge of setting realistic goals in real estate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"239\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Setting-Unrealistic-Goals.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Setting-Unrealistic-Goals-300x72.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Setting-Unrealistic-Goals-768x184.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-241981\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Avoid setting unrealistic goals in real estate marketing</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Many real estate agents aim high, but setting sky-high goals without grounding them in reality is like setting sail without a compass. It&#8217;s vital to set realistic targets that align with what&#8217;s typical in the real estate market. To help you set achievable goals, here are a few strategies and examples:</p>\n<h3 id=\"break-down-annual-goals-into-manageable-tasks\">Break Down annual Goals into Manageable Tasks</h3>\n<p>Set specific annual goals, like increasing your annual commission by selling one more home per month than last year. This can give you a clear target and a sense of direction.</p>\n<p>Break down these annual goals into monthly or weekly tasks. For instance, aim to hold two open houses per week or send out 20 handwritten cards to your sphere of influence and network each week</p>\n<h3 id=\"implement-smart-goals\">Implement SMART Goals</h3>\n<p>Use the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) framework to set clear and realistic goals. For example, host a homebuyers event each quarter or complete a certain number of CE credit hours by a specific date.</p>\n<p>This approach ensures your goals are ambitious, grounded in reality and trackable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"regularly-monitor-and-adjust-goals\">Regularly Monitor and Adjust Goals</h3>\n<p>Keep track of your progress with tools like Google Docs or a CRM system. Regularly reviewing your goals helps you stay on track and make necessary adjustments.</p>\n<p>Periodically analyze your performance to identify areas to improve or to adjust strategies if you’re not hitting your targets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"focus-on-building-habits\">Focus on Building Habits</h3>\n<p>Rather than solely focusing on outcomes, concentrate on and celebrate good habits. For example, make it a habit to call prospects daily or to post one YouTube video per week. Celebrate these small wins along the way to stay positive and motivated. This will help you keep pushing towards your larger goals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stay-accountable\">Stay Accountable</h3>\n<p>Stay accountable by sharing your goals with a mentor, broker, or friend. Better yet, partner up with a peer who also needs accountability and work to keep each other accountable.</p>\n<p>By setting realistic and manageable goals, you will build towards long-term success. You’ll stay on track and continue to grow your business effectively.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-not-learning-from-mistakes\">1. Not Learning from Mistakes</h2>\n<p>Yep, this is the number one real estate agent marketing mistake! Mistakes aren&#8217;t just mishaps. Mistakes are learning opportunities, like stepping stones to mastery. Every missed target or campaign hiccup is a lesson in disguise. Here&#8217;s how you can turn those slip-ups into success stories:</p>\n<h3 id=\"embrace-a-growth-mindset\">Embrace a Growth Mindset</h3>\n<p>Adopt a mindset where mistakes are viewed as opportunities for learning rather than failures. This mindset fosters resilience and continuous improvement. So, the next time you make a mistake say to yourself “in the lesson, find the gift.” That gift will make every day thereafter more effective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"document-lessons-learned\">Document Lessons Learned</h3>\n<p>Maintain a “lessons learned” log. Documenting what worked and what didn’t helps avoid repeating the same mistakes. For example, if a particular type of social media post gets little engagement, note that down and try a different approach next time</p>\n<p>Actively learning from mistakes makes all the difference. There is always something to be learned and improved if you take the time to figure it out and make the needed changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ve seen the pitfalls.

And let’s face it, happy agents tend to be more successful agents.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a37cf1e2cc5b6038-Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about something that most agents overlook—brokerage profitability. Trust me, you care more about this than you think. A profitable brokerage is more stable and less likely to make decisions that negatively impact agents and clients.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with <strong>Sotheby’s</strong> International Realty. As part of Anywhere Real Estate, which includes brands like Coldwell Banker, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, and Century 21, they’ve posted 20 quarters of earnings with 12 profitable and 8 unprofitable quarters. So, they’ve had <strong>60% profitable quarters</strong>—better than some, but still room for improvement.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, <strong>eXp Realty</strong>’s track record is hard to beat. With 20 quarters of posted earnings, they’ve had 15 profitable quarters, giving them <strong>75% profitable</strong> quarters.  And, by the way, when you look at all the publicly traded brokerages over the past 5 years<strong>, eXp Realty is the only profitable one</strong>.</p>\n<p>This kind of financial stability translates into continued improvements for both agents and clients. It’s simple—when a brokerage is making money, they reinvest in their agents, offering better tools, training, and opportunities for growth. So, if you want a brokerage that’s both growing and financially stable, eXp has the upper hand here.</p>\n<p>What does that mean for agents? It means you’re at a brokerage that’s constantly improving and innovating, making things better for you and your clients. If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cf7f04b909c13ff1-Commission-Splits-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s get into one of the hottest topics for agents—commission splits. How much of your hard-earned commission will you actually take home, and how much is going to the brokerage? This can be a bit trickier to pin down at Sotheby’s since splits vary depending on the agent and location, just like many traditional brokerages.</p>\n<p>When I interviewed <strong>at Sotheby’s,</strong> despite having a strong resume—including being a former California attorney and having a large sphere of influence—they offered me a 70/30 split. Yep, 70% to me, and 30% to Sotheby’s. Our research shows that their splits range from <strong>70/30 up to 90/10,</strong> depending on the office and what deal you manage to negotiate.</p>\n<p>Now, here’s where <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out: it’s transparent, and the split is the same for everyone—no negotiations, no guessing. eXp agents start at an <strong>80/20</strong> split and move to <strong>100%</strong> once the 20% you’ve paid to eXp reaches $16,000 for the year. That’s called a cap.</p>\n<p>And if you hit certain milestones after capping, eXp will actually give you back that <strong>$16,000 in company stock</strong>. So, not only do you get to keep 100% of your commissions after capping, but you can also earn <strong>more than 100%</strong> through stock opportunities. Pretty sweet, right?</p>\n<p>Plus, with eXp, it doesn’t matter if you’re a brand-new agent or a top producer—everyone gets the same deal. There’s no behind-the-scenes haggling. You know exactly what you’re getting from day one. At Sotheby’s, capping may be available in some markets, but it varies widely, so you’ll need to check locally.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is a must-have for agents, as it protects both you and your brokerage from potential legal claims. But how you pay for E&#038;O insurance can make a big difference, and here’s where Sotheby’s and eXp Realty really diverge.</p>\n<p>When I was looking at <strong>Sotheby’s</strong>, they quoted me a hefty <strong>$2,200</strong> due upfront every year before I even closed a deal. That’s a big chunk of cash to shell out, especially if you’re just starting out or haven’t closed any transactions yet.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty,</strong> it’s a whole different ball game. Agents don’t pay for E&#038;O insurance until they actually close deals, which means you’re only paying once you’ve earned money. And even then, it’s <strong>just $60 per deal</strong>. The best part? eXp <strong>caps the E&#038;O fees at $750</strong> per year. So, after you’ve paid that $750, you’re done for the year—no more E&#038;O fees, no matter how many deals you close. That’s a solid $1,450 savings over Sotheby’s, and you only pay it if you’re making money. Definitely a much better deal for your wallet!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Fees</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about fees—because no one wants to see their hard-earned commission eaten up by surprise charges.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, there’s an easy-to-manage <strong>$85 monthly </strong>fee, and there’s a <strong>$25 transaction</strong> fee per deal until you hit your cap. Super straightforward.</p>\n<p><strong>Sotheby’s</strong>? It’s a bit more complex. While they don’t have a direct transaction fee, they do charge a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> on every transaction. Honestly, this feels just like a transaction fee because it comes straight out of your commission every time you close a deal.</p>\n<p>Plus, at most offices, there’s also around <strong>$150 &#8211; $190 monthly </strong>fee, so that’s nearly double what eXp agents pay just to keep the lights on.</p>\n<p>When you stack up the numbers, eXp’s simpler fee structure ends up being a lot more cost-effective, especially when you start closing more deals. Sotheby’s royalty fee can really add up over time and take a bigger bite out of your earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned pro or just starting out, having the right training and support can make all the difference in your career. And this is where <strong>eXp Realty</strong> really stands out. They’ve got over <strong>50 live training sessions</strong> every week, plus a whole <strong>library of on-demand courses</strong>. New agents can jump into a <strong>“Fast Start” program</strong> to start earning fast, while more experienced agents can level up with advanced training like the <strong>“Kick Start” program</strong>.</p>\n<p>On top of that, sponsors (like us at Smart Agent Alliance) add even more training and mentorship to the mix. And, if you ever run into a snag, eXp offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> with <strong>2,000 full-time staff</strong> members ready to help out. It’s hard to beat that level of accessibility and resources.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about <strong>Sotheby’s</strong>. Unfortunately, the experience there varies—<em>a lot</em>. When I interviewed at Sotheby’s, I was basically told to go buy my own $2,200 course for training. There was <strong>no training</strong> in place, so what you get in terms of training depends heavily on your local office broker.</p>\n<p>And what about agent support? There’s <strong>hit or miss support</strong> based on your office broker’s availability. That can leave you hanging if you need quick help before a client meeting or during a deal.  Not ideal.</p>\n<p>At eXp, you’ll never be left waiting for your broker to be free. Their support system is built for agents, with experts on call whenever you need them. It’s the kind of setup that allows agents to thrive with confidence, knowing that help is always available.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to tech, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is a standout. They’ve taken the real estate world into the digital age with their fully virtual brokerage. Agents can access everything they need—training, support, collaboration, and even client meetings—in <strong>eXp World,</strong> their unique metaverse-style platform. No brick-and-mortar office is needed because eXp’s virtual setup is that effective. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Beyond that, eXp provides agents with a personal <strong>IDX website, a powerful CRM, a marketing center</strong> loaded with customizable templates, single property websites, social media content, <strong>and much more</strong>. And eXp is constantly improving, adding new tools and resources to keep agents ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p>Now, <strong>Sotheby’s</strong> isn’t exactly known for its cutting-edge tech. While it doesn’t have the fancy virtual platforms like eXp, it does offer <strong>global marketing</strong> for high-end home sellers through their established international presence.</p>\n<p>That’s great for agents working with luxury properties, but here’s the kicker—<strong>eXp Luxury</strong> offers the same level of <strong>global exposure</strong> for your listings at a fraction of the cost to the agent. That means eXp agents can market luxury properties worldwide while keeping more of their commissions in their pockets.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re tech-savvy or just appreciate having the best tools at your fingertips, eXp Realty is the clear winner. And even in the luxury space, eXp matches up with Sotheby’s global marketing power while being easier on your wallet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-sothebys-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Sotheby’s May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s be real—if you’re someone who thrives in a traditional office setting with that classic face-to-face interaction, then Sotheby’s might be the better fit.</p>\n<p>They’ve got physical offices where you can soak in that luxury vibe, and if you need the structure of an office broker pushing you to meet deadlines, Sotheby’s delivers. For agents who prefer having that in-person accountability, Sotheby’s could feel like home.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out of your home office space, eXp Realty does provide <strong>FREE access to the 4000 Regus office business lounges around the world</strong>.</p>\n<p>But that won’t be enough if you’re someone who likes being part of a more structured environment, where you need a local broker nearby for your daily motivation and productivity.  In that case, eXp Realty’s virtual freedom might not be for you.</p>\n<p>Not everyone thrives in a completely independent, online space. So, if you know you need someone to keep you on track, Sotheby’s is probably a better match for your style.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond all the usual perks, eXp Realty brings some truly standout features that most other brokerages just can’t match. If you work in the luxury market, eXp’s<strong> Luxury Division</strong> gives your high-end listings global exposure, putting them in front of the right audience worldwide.</p>\n<p>They’ve also got a team called <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose whole job is to find and deliver quality leads straight to eXp agents—pretty awesome, right?</p>\n<p>Their <strong>Referral tool</strong> makes sending referrals to other agents a breeze, and for those who want to focus solely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> helps cut costs while keeping you in the business.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, where you can earn extra income by simply recommending agents to join eXp. That income doesn’t just stop when you retire and it’s willable, meaning it keeps coming even after you’re gone. It’s a win all around!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Choosing between <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> and Sotheby’s comes down to what you value most as an agent. eXp offers transparency with an 80/20 commission split, low fees, 24/7 support, cutting-edge tech, and global marketing through eXp Luxury—all without the hefty royalty fees that Sotheby’s agents face.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sotheby’s provides physical office spaces and global marketing, but with fewer training and support resources, and more costly fees. If you thrive in a traditional office and value in-person accountability, Sotheby’s may suit you. But if you prefer flexibility, higher commission potential, and modern tools, eXp Realty has the edge.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.
