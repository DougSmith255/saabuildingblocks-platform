As an agent, this is your chance to show homeowners that you&#8217;re the best real estate agent to sell their house.</p>\n<p>Remember, other real estate agents might be competing for the same listing, so you must bring your A-game to the task. Bringing your A-game entails thorough preparation for the listing presentation appointment.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll showcase your expertise, market knowledge, and dedication to achieving the seller’s real estate goals. This is your opportunity to shine and demonstrate why you are the most qualified and trustworthy agent for the job.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-steps-to-prepare-thoroughly-before-your-listing-appointment\">6 Steps to Prepare Thoroughly Before Your Listing Presentation Appointment</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4299\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0f609c551d72d866-222.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"454\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/222.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/222-300x136.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/222-768x349.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Taking the time to prep for your listing appointment will determine the success or failure of your meeting. Remember, you’re likely competing for the role of listing agent. This is your chance &#8211; be prepared to outshine all other agents.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Review the current local market statistics</strong> so you can accurately describe whether it’s a buyer’s market or a seller’s market. Know what the local market trends are for average and median prices, price per square foot, days on the market, inventory, and whether homes are selling above or below list price.</li>\n<li><strong>Review the neighborhood statistics</strong> and also what properties are currently for sale in the neighborhood as well as other homes in the area that buyers will also likely be comparing to this property. These properties are your seller’s competition as buyers will likely see these too.</li>\n<li><strong>Research the seller</strong> through an online search. You may learn facts that will clue you into how you should do your presentation. You may also discover common interests or connections with the seller, which mentioned appropriately, can help foster a sense of unity and rapport.</li>\n<li><strong>Study the home’s history. </strong>Find out when the home was built, how big is it, and what were the previous sales prices. Demonstrating that you&#8217;ve done your homework will strengthen your credibility and professionalism.</li>\n<li><strong>Do a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA). </strong>A CMA involves comparing the property with nearby, similar houses to arrive at some range of likely value. Create a CMA with your local MLS tools or try our favorite tool, <a href=\"https://www.narrpr.com/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RPR</a>, which we highly recommend for this task. We love it!</li>\n<li><strong>Create a Comprehensive Pre-Listing Packet.</strong> This is a packet that you will leave with the seller. Include market statistics, neighborhood statistics including other homes for sale, the home’s CMA, information about the home selling process, your skills, what your brokerage offers, and a listing agreement. Print it all on at least 32lb paper for a professional look.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"4-rules-for-mastering-communication-and-relationship-building-during-your-listing-presentation\">4 Rules for Mastering Communication and Relationship Building During Your Listing Presentation</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4300\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e6ef092ba0c371d4-333.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"459\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/333.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/333-300x138.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/333-768x353.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Winning this listing is going to, first and foremost, start with your excellent social skills and communication skills. Practice up on skills like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Active Listening:</strong> Pay close attention to the seller&#8217;s needs, concerns, and preferences. Show that you are fully engaged in the conversation by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and asking follow-up questions to clarify their goals. Earn their trust.</li>\n<li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Understand the emotional aspect of selling a home. Acknowledge the seller&#8217;s feelings and validate their concerns. Empathizing with their situation helps build trust and rapport.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Use plain language and avoid jargon. Ensure that your explanations are easy to comprehend, especially when discussing contracts and legal terms. Look for understanding, not confusion, in the sellers’ expressions.</li>\n<li><strong>Answering Questions:</strong> Be prepared to answer all questions regarding the selling process, pricing, and potential challenges. If you don&#8217;t have an immediate answer, tell the sellers that you’ll find out and then promptly do so in your follow-up.</li>\n<li><strong>Body Language:</strong> Make the sellers comfortable by mimicking their actions. For example, if they talk quietly and slowly, do something similar. If they use their hands a lot, use your hands some too. Keep it real and not too matchy-matchy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"8-steps-for-listing-presentation-day\">8 Steps for Listing Presentation Day</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4301\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e0523231852f0b13-444.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"390\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/444.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/444-300x117.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/444-768x300.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve diligently prepared for the presentation and honed your social and communication skills. Now, it&#8217;s time to rendezvous with the client at their home.</p>\n<p>Arrive at the home at the appointed time. Don’t be late. Don’t park in their driveway (to make sure nothing from your car drips off onto their driveway and creates a problem for them). Knock on the door; introduce yourself; and exchange pleasantries. Next, go through the following steps.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while these steps are listed in a particular order, you must adapt and respond to the sellers&#8217; cues. Being flexible helps the presentation flow naturally.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-make-the-most-of-touring-the-sellers-home\">1. Make the Most of Touring the Seller’s Home</h3>\n<p>After initial pleasantries, say something like, “I’ve brought some things for us to look at but I’d love to see your home first. Would you show it to me?” This demonstrates your respect for their space and the house tour will provide valuable insights for you about the home’s unique features.</p>\n<p>The home sellers will likely say “yes” as they want to tell you about the home and they’d love to see that you like it too. As you tour each room, ask questions about what the seller loves. This provides great information and tunes you into their emotional connection to the house.</p>\n<p>Following the tour, ask where you can all sit down to discuss the selling process. Be sure to sit across from the sellers to provide easy eye contact and good presentation views for the sellers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-time-to-start-your-listing-presentation\">2. Time to Start Your Listing Presentation</h3>\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s time for the pivotal listing presentation. Take a seat with the homeowners and follow these tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Technology to Dazzle. Use laptops or tablets to present visuals that substantiate your points. This presentation along with your meticulously prepared pre-listing packet ups your professionalism and organization and further bolsters seller confidence in you.</li>\n<li>Provide a Comprehensive Outline. Let the homeowners know what your presentation is going to cover and ask them if there is anything on the list that they don’t want to discuss.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-leverage-your-brokerage-or-team-for-credibility\">3. Leverage your Brokerage or Team for Credibility</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4004 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/88a688d260c88a0e-The-FREE-Value-Packed-Proposition.webp/public\" alt=\"Intense wolf eyes flanking the bold Wolf Pack logo, representing the focused vision and free value-packed proposition of eXp Realty&#039;s sponsorship team.\" width=\"493\" height=\"202\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-FREE-Value-Packed-Proposition.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-FREE-Value-Packed-Proposition-300x123.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-FREE-Value-Packed-Proposition-768x314.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" /></p>\n<p>Begin by sharing your real estate sales experience so the homeowner will gain confidence in your abilities. If you’re new with no experience, no worries, just highlight the achievements of your team or brokerage. Use statements like “we accomplished this…” or “our firm had this many sales last year”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-review-your-prepped-materials\">4. Review your Prepped Materials</h3>\n<p>Remember that pre-listing packet you prepared? Time to dive into it. Discuss the current market statistics and the neighborhood statistics. Go over the home selling process, your skills, and what your brokerage offers. Save the CMA and competing homes for sale information for a later step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-explain-your-effective-marketing-plan-for-listings\">5. Explain Your Effective Marketing Plan for Listings</h3>\n<p>Be sure to share your awesome marketing plan for their home. Include as many of the following items as possible to shine above your competition!</p>\n<h4 id=\"utilizing-the-local-mls-to-enhance-listings\">Utilizing the Local MLS to Enhance Listings</h4>\n<p>Let the seller know that you’ll be listing their property on the <strong>Local Multiple Listing Service (MLS)</strong> and on real estate industry sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, and Redfin. Also, inform the sellers that the MLS is hands down the best way to sell a home and only licensed agents can access it. Tell them that the MLS listing will result in buyer agents scheduling house showings.</p>\n<h4 id=\"harnessing-the-potential-of-websites\">Harnessing the Potential of Websites</h4>\n<p>Offer a dedicated website, or a page on your website, for the property that showcases the home. Create a QR code and print that everywhere you advertise the property so that interested buyers can easily and quickly view all the home details.</p>\n<h4 id=\"being-a-social-media-guru\">Being a Social Media Guru</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-4095 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a5c6ea90ae44dcd9-9.webp/public\" alt=\"Maximizing Reach on Social Media - Logos of Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok for Real Estate Content Creation\" width=\"383\" height=\"128\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9.webp 434w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-300x100.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" /></p>\n<p>Share with the homeowners that you are well-versed in social media.

Explain the Essential Steps to Prepare a Home for the Market</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve completed your marketing plan, you’ll move on to information about prepping the home for sale, staging, photography, and videography. Some of these conversations will be awkward so prime your social skills to create a kind approach. Follow these tips:</p>\n<h4 id=\"making-physical-changes-to-improve-the-homes-look-and-feel\">Making Physical Changes to Improve the Home’s Look and Feel</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engage Positively:</strong> Start the talk by highlighting the importance of making the home as appealing as possible to potential buyers. Emphasize that this preparation is like getting ready for a grand performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Address Visible Repairs:</strong> Explain that it&#8217;s crucial to begin with visible repairs and updates that immediately catch the eye. Why? Because if a buyer sees something wrong, they often assume there’s a lot more wrong that they don’t see. Mention specific examples like fixing leaky faucets, quieting squeaky doors, and attending to chipped paint.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a Spacious Feel:</strong> Suggest the idea of rearranging furniture to make rooms appear more spacious. Encourage the seller to consider removing personal items such as family photos to help buyers envision themselves living in the space.</li>\n<li><strong>Freshen Up the Look:</strong> Describe the benefits of making improvements like installing new fixtures or applying fresh paint, both in contemporary style. Mention how these enhancements rejuvenate rooms to something that today’s buyers love!</li>\n<li><strong>Introduce Fix Now, Pay Later:</strong> Is the homeowner feeling overwhelmed? If you’re with eXp Realty, introduce the concept of letting someone else handle it all with no upfront cost!From cleaning to painting, kitchen remodels, moving walls, exterior refreshes, and more, our eXp Partner does the work at a competitive price.\n<p>The best part? Homeowners don’t have to pay for the work until their home sells! And, they won’t be charged interest or any fees either during the listing period.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"maximizing-the-impact-of-home-staging-in-listings\">Maximizing the Impact of Home Staging in Listings</h4>\n<p>Next, you’ll need to educate the homeowner regarding staging. Staging a home means decorating it so buyers can imagine living there themselves. Introduce these benefits of staging:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homes that are staged sell on average 50% faster and for more money.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Staging makes spaces feel larger.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Staging helps highlight the best parts of the house.</li>\n<li>Staging makes photos look better online where most buyers start their search.</li>\n<li>Not as nice, but cost-effective, staging can also be done virtually, where the components are added to pictures of empty rooms still helping buyers visualize how to use a room.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-power-of-hd-photography-and-videography-in-listings\">The Power of HD Photography and Videography in Listings</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4303 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/90653c3e8e71c805-Small-Blog-Images-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Small-Blog-Images-1.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Small-Blog-Images-1-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Last, you’ll want to introduce the professional images you’ll provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HD Photography &#8211; The home needs <strong>HD photography</strong> so every detail shines through online listings. These photos will capture each room from its best angle, showing off space and light beautifully. Professional photographers know how to do this just right &#8211; that is why you hire and pay for them!</li>\n<li>Videography Impact &#8211; Videography takes the home up another notch! Videos give potential buyers a real-life walk-through experience without stepping foot inside. They also share a story of what life could be like in this new place – something still images can’t always convey alone. That’s why you’ll hire and pay for videography too!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"7-discuss-winning-pricing-strategies\">7. Discuss Winning Pricing Strategies</h3>\n<p>Now the most important conversation you’ll have &#8211; at what price will the home be listed? Here’s how to move through this critical and sometimes emotional discussion:</p>\n<h4 id=\"setting-realistic-expectations\"><strong>Setting Realistic Expectations:</strong></h4>\n<p>Begin by stressing the importance of a realistic listing price. Explain that homeowners often value their properties higher than potential buyers. To establish realistic expectations, provide a brief overview of the current market conditions and the state of the neighborhood.</p>\n<h4 id=\"introducing-the-comparative-market-analysis-cma\"><strong>Introducing the Comparative Market Analysis (CMA):</strong></h4>\n<p>Introduce the meticulously prepared CMA that you&#8217;ve created and introduce the other homes on the market that their home will compete with for a buyer. Emphasize that the final price will be determined by prospective buyers comparing their property to others currently available.</p>\n<p>Want to be a super agent? Plan a tour for your sellers to see every house that competes with theirs. This goes a long way to getting the homeowner to be realistic in their price expectations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"discussion-on-price\"><strong>Discussion on Price:</strong></h4>\n<p>Ask the sellers for their opinion on the home&#8217;s value. This approach provides valuable insights into the sellers&#8217; expectations. You need to know their expectations before sharing your own beliefs so that you’ll know whether they are realistic (easy to work with) or not (harder).</p>\n<h4 id=\"explaining-pricing-strategies\"><strong>Explaining Pricing Strategy:</strong></h4>\n<p>Once you have the sellers&#8217; desired price, share your strategy. Layout 3 possibilities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discuss whether it&#8217;s advantageous to list at a lower price to potentially incite a bidding war for multiple offers leading to a swift sale at a potentially higher-than-expected price.</li>\n<li>Consider if it’s better to price the house just right for a fairly fast sale.</li>\n<li>Mention the option of pricing higher if the property is exceptionally appealing but be sure to stress the need for a periodic reevaluation, ideally within a month, to adjust the price if necessary.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"8-listing-agreement\">8. Listing Agreement</h3>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve decided on the right price, it&#8217;s time to make things official. The listing agreement is the contract between you and your sellers giving you the exclusive right to sell their home.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll ask the sellers if they would like to go over the listing agreement now to sign today. Or, you can offer as we do, that they read the listing agreement at their leisure and then you’ll contact them to answer any questions and then email them an electronic version to sign.</p>\n<h2 id=\"effective-strategies-for-following-up-after-a-listing-presentation\">Effective Strategies for Following Up After a Listing Presentation</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4027\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5a85a537754b392a-Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT.webp/public\" alt=\"Real Estate Professional Reflecting on Mastering ChatGPT Techniques with Laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"408\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT-300x122.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT-768x313.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Congratulations on completing your listing presentation.

It&#8217;s like your audition for the lead role in their home-selling journey.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-should-i-deliver-my-listing-presentation\">How should I deliver my listing presentation?</h3>\n<p>Deliver it with confidence and clarity. Think of it as storytelling—with you guiding them through a tale where they happily sell their home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-is-explaining-my-marketing-strategy-important\">Why is explaining my marketing strategy important?</h3>\n<p>It’s crucial because sellers want to know how you’ll make their property shine in the marketplace—like revealing the secret sauce that makes a dish irresistible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-goes-into-preparing-a-home-to-list\">What goes into preparing a home to list?</h3>\n<p>A lot if you want buyers to visualize themselves in the home. Examples of changes include decluttering, repairs, and staging—the makeover that turns an everyday house into every buyer&#8217;s dream home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-discuss-winning-pricing-strategies-during-a-listing-presentation\">Can you discuss winning pricing strategies during a listing presentation?</h3>\n<p>Absolutely! It’s about hitting the sweet spot—pricing that attracts buyers without leaving money on the table. Like finding Goldilocks&#8217; &#8220;just right&#8221; porridge temperature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-next-steps-after-a-listing-presentation\">What are the next steps after a listing presentation?</h3>\n<p>Post-presentation, it’s action time: signing agreements, setting timelines—it’s like mapping out our treasure hunt for the perfect buyer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-buyers-market\">What is a buyer’s market?</h3>\n<p>A buyer&#8217;s market in real estate refers to a market condition where there is an abundance of homes available for sale, and the number of potential buyers is relatively low. In this scenario, buyers have the upper hand as they have more choices, negotiate favorable terms, and often enjoy lower prices due to the surplus of homes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-sellers-market\">What is a seller’s market?</h3>\n<p>A seller&#8217;s market in real estate is a market condition where there is a high demand for homes, but the supply of available properties is relatively limited. In this scenario, sellers have the upper hand as they have fewer homes to choose from, which often leads to increased property prices and favorable terms for sellers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-cma\">What is a CMA?</h3>\n<p>A Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) is a method used in real estate to estimate the value of a specific property by comparing it to similar properties that have recently been sold in the same area. Real estate agents and professionals typically conduct CMAs to help sellers determine an appropriate listing price for their property or to assist buyers in making informed decisions about how much to offer for a home.</p>\n<h3>How long should a listing presentation be?</h3>\n<p>The length of a real estate listing presentation can vary, but it&#8217;s generally recommended to keep it concise and focused, typically lasting between 30 minutes to 1 hour. Don’t bore the sellers but be sure to answer all their questions.</p>\n<h3>What does listing presentation mean?</h3>\n<p>A real estate listing presentation is a formal meeting or presentation that a real estate agent conducts with a potential seller who is interested in selling their property. The agent should aim to present why they are the best agent for the job.</p>\n<h3>What to bring to a listing presentation?</h3>\n<p>Not much &#8211; car keys, cell phone, pre-listing packet, and a laptop or tablet to display information.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s all about how you talk, listen, understand, and get along with people. If chatting, making friends, and tuning into people’s emotions isn&#8217;t your thing, then being a realtor will be tricky.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to work every day with people who may want to buy a house or sell a house. Buyers and sellers will have questions and they’ll likely be emotional whether it’s nervous, scared, excited, confused or something else.</p>\n<p>Your job is to be their guide, someone they can trust and feel comfortable talking to.  You’ll need excellent social skills to pull that off. And it&#8217;s not just the people looking to buy or sell houses that you need to have excellent social skills for.</p>\n<p>You also must work with real estate agents on the other side of the deal. You’ll need make nice with that agent &#8211; be friendly while getting answers that will help your client.  If you’re inclined to be confrontational, you won’t get far in helping your client get the best deal for them.</p>\n<p>And there are even more people involved in deals, like loan officers, inspectors, and escrow officers. You will likely be interacting with all of these people and your fabulous social skills will again help your client get the best outcome.</p>\n<p>If you’re not sure where to start to brush up on having great social skills, practice listening first.  Listen twice as much as you talk. Also, ask questions so you really understand what people want. Last, keep your smile ready because a friendly face can make a huge difference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"agent-communication-skills\">Agent Communication Skills</h3>\n<p>Communication skills for real estate agents are different from social skills. Social skills are more about creating harmonious working relationships likely to create advantageous outcomes.</p>\n<p>But communication skills? They&#8217;re a whole different ball game. They&#8217;re about clarity, precision around complex issues, and sometimes, tackling awkward issues with finesse.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4278 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e2e0b6691746e423-communication.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/communication.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/communication-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Regarding complexity, breaking down real estate contracts into bite-sized, understandable pieces is important. That&#8217;s what you’ll need to do. At the same time, make sure your customers don&#8217;t feel overwhelmed. Instead, you want them to feel empowered and informed.</p>\n<p>Regarding awkward information, take, for example, advising a client on prepping or staging their home for sale. Let’s say that to get top dollar on the home’s sale, or sometimes just to sell the house at all, you know their house needs some changing.</p>\n<p>Whether those changes are merely removing items from a too-crowded room or making big physical changes, you’ll need awesome communication skills and some social skills too.</p>\n<p>Almost every seller loves their home as is and no one wants to hear that they must make changes to “improve” it.  So, in presenting this “your home needs changes” talk, it will matter what you say and how you say it.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve got to blend honesty with tact. It&#8217;s a skill to convey a clear message on how the changes will benefit them while leaving the sellers still believing that you love their home enough to be a great salesperson on their behalf.</p>\n<h3 id=\"negotiation-techniques-for-new-real-estate-agents\">Negotiation Techniques for New Real Estate Agents</h3>\n<p>As new agents in the real estate industry, <strong>honing your negotiation techniques</strong> is crucial. It&#8217;s about finding win-win situations. To do this, you’ll need to understand the needs and desires of the buyers and sellers and then find common ground to work with.</p>\n<p>For example, if your buyer loves a house but it&#8217;s slightly out of their budget, find out if the seller has other needs and desires that your buyer might meet to thereby create an offer where a lower price may still satisfy the seller while meeting the buyer’s budget.</p>\n<p>Never get confrontational. That will not serve the best interests of your client. Your social skills in playing nice, as well as being respectful and professional, with the opposing agent will help your client get information that can lead to a successful negotiation and a great outcome.</p>\n<p>Remember, good negotiators are patient and think before they speak. They are prepared. They know when to push forward and when to step back, all while maintaining emotional control.</p>\n<p>Don’t know where to start? We recommend the book “Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss. It’s not about real estate, but the principles are gold.</p>\n<h3 id=\"time-management-skills-for-agents\">Time Management Skills for Agents</h3>\n<p>In real estate, juggling various tasks efficiently is a necessity, especially for new busy agents. The ability to manage time effectively is vital as you&#8217;ll find yourself swamped with diverse responsibilities and the constant need to learn new and evolving information.</p>\n<p>Start by prioritizing tasks each day—listing appointments, generating new leads, meetings you must take, and deadlines you must meet.</p>\n<p>Use tools like calendars, task organizers, or apps to keep track of everything you need to do. Try asana.com &#8211; that’s my favorite free task organizer.</p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget: delegating or automating are fantastic goals for real estate agents!  You can delegate with the help of a virtual assistant. <strong>Virtual assistants</strong> provide a variety of skills to help you perform a variety of tasks from editing your social media content to making cold calls for leads. Some overseas assistants can also be cost-effective even for new real estate agents.</p>\n<p>Regarding automation, a customer relationship management (CRM) tool can help. We’ll dive into CRMs in more detail below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-ways-to-get-your-first-real-estate-deal\">5 Ways to Get Your First Real Estate Deal</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4275\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5b49d6284f51b452-Success.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, there are only five strategies to land your first deal. All five are about prospecting techniques for new real estate agents. Leads are people who may hire you to help them buy or sell property. Without leads, you won&#8217;t have deals to close. You can find dozens of strategies to get new leads. Let’s make it simple and break it down to just five.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-tapping-your-sphere-of-influence\">1. Tapping Your Sphere of Influence</h3>\n<p>People do business with those that they know, like, and trust. You already know lots of people who know, like, and trust you. These people are your personal network, your “Sphere of Influence”. You may already know someone who is looking to buy or sell real estate.</p>\n<p>You need to let your sphere know you’re a real estate agent. Craft a compelling announcement to let everyone know that you’re in the real estate business. Don’t just say “I’m in real estate, come work with me”.</p>\n<p>Instead, make your message more compelling, provide context as to why you became a real estate agent, why you are passionate about it, and what you bring to the table that&#8217;s different than other agents. That’s your unique value proposition and it sets you apart.</p>\n<p>Your unique value could be something from your past that helps potential home buyers and sellers like you worked in construction or lived in some location long enough to be an expert about it.</p>\n<p>Or your unique value could be something you offer that many agents don’t, like staging homes or more flexible commissions and agent contracts. Whatever it is, tell everyone you know about it.</p>\n<p>Prepare a proper announcement with your picture. Email everyone you know. Share it on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and TikTok. People who already know may work with you as a new agent to support you. That happens all the time.</p>\n<p>Last, even if no deals flow immediately from your announcement, your friends, family, and connections may refer you to others. So don&#8217;t miss the opportunity to announce yourself. Don&#8217;t be shy. Your sphere can be a gold mine for leads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-attending-networking-events-for-real-estate-leads\">2. Attending Networking Events for Real Estate Leads</h3>\n<p>This is all about making connections. Attend networking events with local startup business owners, real estate investors, or any other group that has something to do with real estate. The more people you know, the more deals you&#8217;re going to do.</p>\n<p>Plan to do one event every single week and stick to that plan. Here are some pro tips:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Going Alone is best &#8211; you’ll be more likely to talk to others if you are alone.</li>\n<li>Listen more than you speak &#8211; that way you learn what others need.</li>\n<li>Offer value &#8211; what can you do or provide that will help others accomplish their goals?</li>\n<li>Bring business cards &#8211; share them with the people you meet. They might call you when they need a real estate agent or they may refer you to others.</li>\n<li>Follow-up &#8211; after the event, don&#8217;t forget to reach out quickly! Send thank-you notes or emails that show detail the value you plan to provide…and then provide it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"3-prospecting-for-real-estate-clients\">3. Prospecting for New Clients</h3>\n<p>Prospecting means you reach out to people that you don’t know and see if they may need to buy or sell real estate. Reaching out to strangers is not easy but deals can flow fast. Again, there are many methods to prospect strangers but there are only two very effective choices.</p>\n<h4>Cold Calling</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4277 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/613f727154c7d78c-cold-calling.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Cold calling refers to calling people you have never met and have no connection with. But, as a new agent, don’t cold-call just anyone! Instead, call only homeowners who have listed their home as <strong>“For Sale By Owner” (FSBOs)</strong> and sellers whose previous home sale listing expired (so it didn’t sell).</p>\n<p>This is a lot better than calling random people. These two groups are people who definitely are selling their homes.</p>\n<h4>Door Knocking</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4280 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/1baf4cfcae83bb61-door-knocking.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/door-knocking.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/door-knocking-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Door knocking is just like it sounds, you go around a neighborhood and knock on doors looking to strike up conversations with the homeowners. Of course, with door knocking you&#8217;ll meet lots of people who don&#8217;t want to sell their house right now but they may later.</p>\n<p>Be sure to offer people something of value. For example, you might offer to email them a free monthly newsletter about which homes sold in their neighborhood and at what price.</p>\n<p>Neighbors are almost always interested in knowing the details of homes in their own neighborhood. And, you get their email address in exchange which will help you stay in touch.</p>\n<h4>Pro prospecting tips for new real estate agents:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>You don’t have to do both cold calling and door knocking. Pick one or the other.</li>\n<li>Prepare scripts but keep it natural</li>\n<li>Be ready for “no” but stay positive</li>\n<li>Keep it short to be respectful of people’s time</li>\n<li>Commit to it &#8211; like you will door knock every single day for 3 hours a day in any weather every day for 6 months straight or you will call every FSBO or owner with an expired listing each week.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The bottom line, no one likes to prospect. But smart prospecting, like the above two strategies, can land you deals fast. Also, there is a great side benefit. That is, as you prospect, you&#8217;ll get better and better at it. That will develop your communication skills which will take you far in the industry.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-open-house-strategies-for-successful-lead-generation\">4. Open House Strategies for Successful Lead Generation</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4281 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ac40829123158243-open-house.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open-house.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open-house-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Doing an open house refers to being the agent that sits at a home’s open house. You do not need to be the listing agent to “host” the open house. Some brokerages do require that you only host open homes for listing agents of your brokerage. Check your broker for the rules.</p>\n<p>Many busy agents with listings love to have another agent sit at their open houses. This is a huge opportunity for you to perhaps meet a person who wants to buy the house. If they are not already represented by a buyer’s agent, they may decide to hire you for the job.</p>\n<p>Also, even for people not interested in the home, you may meet others who are interested in a real estate transaction. There may be real buyers who could use a buyer’s agent. There may be neighbors who are planning to sell and have come by to see their competition.</p>\n<p>Doing open house is four open houses is yet again another way to meet potential prospects and hone your communication skills.</p>\n<p>Hosting open houses has so many benefits and intricacies that we devoted an entire blog just to that topic. You can <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/open-house-tips-for-real-estate-agents-in-2024-to-get-quality-leads/\">read it here</a>. Learn to get the most from your open house. They don’t cost much money, but they do take up your weekend. Make the most of your time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-using-social-media-to-create-a-strong-online-brand\">5. Using Social Media to Create a Strong Online Brand</h3>\n<p>Now, building an effective online presence as a realtor will help you grow. So let&#8217;s talk about social media for growing your business. Leveraging social media is clearly my favorite way to get business and it is what brought my first deal and nearly all my deals thereafter. Here are some amazing benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Attract New Clients: When people reach out to you for their real estate needs, they usually become your customers right then. You won’t have to do lots of <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/listing-presentation-tips/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"41\">presentations</a> or compete with other agents.</li>\n<li>Work Satisfaction: When people call you to help them, instead of you reaching out cold to others, you will likely meet people you enjoy working with. People call people they like and, it’s been my experience, that I like them too!</li>\n<li>Low Views: You don’t need a lot of views, subscribers, or comments to gain customers. You only need the few that are interested in buying or selling real estate.</li>\n<li>Low Expense: Doing social media doesn’t need to be expensive. Filming with your phone works great.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Being successful at social media means being consistent &#8211; at least posting every week. It can also be a huge time commitment and it does take time to pay off. In my experience, most agents start to see the fruits of their labor after roughly six months, but I’ve seen it pay off in as little as 3 months and as long as a year.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to unpack about social media and I can’t provide even the tip of the iceberg here. But, for <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/is-exp-realty-good-for-new-agents/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"9\">new agents</a> who want to join our free team at eXp Realty, we provide step-by-step training for all platforms, making it easy to find your way to lead generation through social media</p>\n<h2 id=\"long-term-success-in-real-estate\">Long-Term Success in Real Estate</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4274\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9003235c7d425e84-Long-Term.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Long-Term.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Long-Term-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Long-Term-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now you know the five ways to get your first deal and every deal after that. But there’s more secret sauce to being a successful real estate agent. Let’s get into that sauce.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-importance-of-a-written-business-plan-for-new-agents\">The Importance of a Written Business Plan for New Agents</h3>\n<p>Yes, we know writing a business plan can feel like a chore. But after you read these reasons why you should, we know you’ll be all over it.</p>\n<h4>Goal Setting</h4>\n<p>You need clear goals to succeed as a real estate agent. A <strong>written business plan</strong> helps you set targets and take action. It&#8217;s like having a map on your journey.</p>\n<p>Think about what you want in your <strong>real estate career</strong>. Do you aim to sell ten houses this year? Do you want to connect with fifty <strong>potential clients</strong>? It’s imperative to document your goals so you can later determine if your plan is working. So, write it down!</p>\n<h4>Strategy Planning</h4>\n<p>Next, your plan needs strategies for reaching your goals. Will you use social media, call FSBOs or expired listings, or host open houses? Will you invest upfront money toward your goals by paying for magazine ads, postcard campaigns, or targeted social media advertising? The key is to decide how you prefer to generate new leads to make your business grow.</p>\n<p>Later, after some reasonable time, you’ll evaluate whether your strategies are working. A written plan makes this evaluation process objective, clear, and useful. If your strategies aren’t providing the success you desire, increase your efforts, better your skills toward the tasks, or adopt new strategies.</p>\n<h4>Prioritizing Actions</h4>\n<p>Besides goals and strategies, be sure to prioritize the actions that are most imperative for getting real estate deals. Those are the actions that yield the greatest value. Prioritize connecting with customers and new lead generation over administrative work.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to get distracted from your goals in the real estate business. New circumstances come up every day, personal stuff too. Prioritizing your actions ensures that you’ll get the most important things done each day. Never miss what must be done today!</p>\n<h3 id=\"consistency-and-habits\">Consistency</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4279 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a7fd1e230fad2daa-consistancy.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/consistancy.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/consistancy-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Alright, let&#8217;s get into gear with your business plan. It&#8217;s all about putting that plan into consistent, daily action. Whether your goal is to reach out to a set number of prospects or make a certain number of calls, commit to it.</p>\n<p>Each day you hit those targets, mark it down as a victory. Why not reward yourself too? Maybe with a little treat or activity you enjoy. It&#8217;s crucial to shift your perspective on success. Don&#8217;t just wait for the big wins like landing a new client or closing a deal.</p>\n<p>Real estate can be challenging, and it&#8217;s the small, daily achievements that create success. By celebrating these everyday accomplishments, you keep your motivation high and your focus sharp. The big wins will follow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximizing-referrals-in-the-real-estate-industry\">Maximizing Referrals in the Real Estate Industry</h3>\n<p>One cool thing about real estate is that those that you work with might tell their friends about you, and just like that, you might get a new customer! Here are two tips to get referrals flowing.</p>\n<p>1. **Be Awesome at Your Job**. Make sure every client is super happy. When people are happy, they share that with others. So, treat each customer like they&#8217;re the most important person. Listen to them carefully, always be on time, and get back to them quickly when they need something.</p>\n<p>2. **Give Gifts for Referrals**. People love getting treats for helping out! If someone tells their friends about how great you are and it brings in a new customer, say thanks by giving them something nice like a gift card or a cheaper price on your services next time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stay-connected\">Stay Connected</h3>\n<p>Now that you understand referrals, the key is to keep in constant touch with your network. This is what we call staying &#8220;top of mind&#8221; in real estate jargon. It means you&#8217;re the first person they think of when real estate needs pop up.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4283 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/427397f7008c86e9-stay-connected.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/stay-connected.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/stay-connected-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>How do you achieve this? Simple: use emails for updates, engage on social media or make quick calls just to check in. You could share fun facts about different houses or neighborhoods, or send out timely updates about the real estate market and home care tips.</p>\n<p>These small but consistent interactions are not just about being remembered; they&#8217;re about building a lasting relationship. By doing this, you ensure a steady flow of deals and referrals coming your way.</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems</strong></p>\n<p>Feeling swamped with all the tasks and client interactions you’ll need to manage? CRM, which stands for Customer Relationship Management, is here to save the day! It&#8217;s a fantastic tool that streamlines your work, making you more effective and efficient.</p>\n<p>Imagine this: every interaction, every detail about your client’s needs and preferences, all neatly organized in one place. No more trying to recall your last conversation or jotting down notes in a dozen places.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s something cool for eXp Realty agents. We get access to a top-notch CRM called kvCORE, absolutely free. This CRM costs up to $5000 a year elsewhere!</p>\n<p>CRMs like kvCORE are about smart client management. You’ll be able to neatly keep track of clients and can segment them by their readiness to buy or sell, ensuring you send appropriate messages to them. Clients will say content and you’ll demonstrate your understanding of their unique needs.</p>\n<p>CRMs like kvCORE can also automate follow-ups. Think of it as having a virtual assistant who keeps you on top of mind with your clients, sending out timely reminders, birthday wishes, or even monthly newsletters &#8211; all without you lifting a finger.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s not all. kvCORE and similar CRMs offer a variety of other features, like running your personal IDX website and creating landing pages to generate more leads. It&#8217;s essential to know what your CRM offers, so you can make the most of these powerful tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"handling-recessions-in-the-real-estate-market\">Handling Recessions in the Real Estate Market</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4282 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/4b2ec08e88054f3e-recession.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/recession.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/recession-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Ok, you’ve followed our advice and now your business is sailing along. Then suddenly, the real estate market hits a slump brought on by recession or a spike in mortgage rates. In these leaner times, fewer deals close. It’s time to prepare for future success.</p>\n<p>The key during downturns? Focus on building stronger relationships. It’s time to engage in meaningful conversations to understand the future needs and aspirations of your contacts.

Relying solely on commissions from home sales can leave you vulnerable during a recession.</p>\n<p>Diversifying your real estate business can provide stability during economic downturns. Here are some solutions to doing just that!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exploring alternative revenue streams beyond traditional home sales:</strong> Real estate agents can expand their income sources by maintaining their real estate career and also consider providing additional services such as property management for rental homes.By taking on the responsibility of managing rental units on behalf of landlords, agents can earn steady monthly income through property management fees. This allows them to tap into a stable market segment and mitigate the impact of fluctuations in home sales.\n<p>Plus renters, often become buyers in the future, so be sure to show your agent value. Note &#8211; not all brokerages allow this. Check before you jump on it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Invest in Rental Properties:</strong> Owning rental properties can provide a consistent source of income even when home sales are slow.Conduct thorough market research and analysis before investing in rental properties to increase the chances of not only a stable income but also a profitable home sale in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Join us at eXp Realty and Gain Revenue Share:</strong> <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp/\">Revenue share at eXp Realty</a> is no joke!

Don&#8217;t wait until you&#8217;re shipwrecked – equip yourself with the skills needed to navigate this tempestuous journey!</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-recession-requires-real-estate-agents-to-adaptquickly\">1. Adaptability</h4>\n<p>As we set sail into potentially choppy economic waters, it is crucial to swiftly adjust to shifting market dynamics. Staying well-informed about current trends, understanding evolving buyer preferences, and promptly altering strategies are vital.</p>\n<p>Effective communication with customers to explain market changes is equally important. Be prepared to discuss what you know about the changed market with your buyers and sellers to keep them adaptable to what changes are needed. Agents must adapt first to help their customers adapt next.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3-maintaining-a-positive-mindset-and-staying-motivated\">2. Mindset and Staying Motivation</h4>\n<p>Navigating the tempestuous economic conditions can be mentally taxing for real estate professionals. However, maintaining a positive outlook is paramount:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on Opportunities: Instead of dwelling on recession-related challenges, seek out emerging trends and underserved market niches.</li>\n<li>Sustaining Motivation: Define clear objectives and formulate an action plan to stay motivated even when facing adversity.</li>\n<li>Seeking Support: Connect with experienced industry peers who have successfully traversed previous economic downturns for guidance and encouragement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"2-hard-times-require-real-estate-agents-to-be-resilient\">3. Real Estate Agent Resilience</h4>\n<p>Weathering a recession requires unwavering determination and resilience. Equip yourself with a resilient mindset by delving into resources on the resilient mindset, such as books, and educational videos, or just search “secrets of resilience” on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Also, having a motivational mantra on hand for you to automatically repeat when rain just keeps coming down can be a valuable anchor during challenging times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"change-sales-approach-to-changing-client-needs\">Change Sales Approach to Changing Client Needs</h3>\n<p>During recessions, the needs and priorities of people in the real estate market often shift. As a savvy agent, it&#8217;s crucial to adapt your sales approach accordingly. This means understanding that buyers may be more cautious and sellers may face difficulties in achieving their desired price points. To meet these changing needs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Be flexible</strong>: Offer alternative financing options or creative solutions to help each buyer navigate challenging economic times.</li>\n<li><strong>Price competitively</strong>: In a downturned market, setting realistic prices is key to attracting potential buyers.</li>\n<li><strong>Highlight long-term benefits</strong>: Emphasize the stability and growth potential of properties even during uncertain times.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"offering-more-to-differentiate-you-from-competitors\">Offering More to Differentiate Yourself from Competitors</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4225 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5bc4557361128e3f-44444.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/44444.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/44444-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Dig deep and figure out what extra value you can provide. From above, you’re already providing market insights, trends, and data to buyers and sellers so they make informed decisions. You’re also networking with industry professionals, so use those new connections to help provide a ray of sunshine for your customers.</p>\n<p>Refer your customers to reputable financial advisors or lenders that provide more insight and help in tough times. Also, consider adding home staging to your list of value provided or perhaps pay for a seller’s staging upfront and allow the seller to pay you back in a closed escrow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nurturing-relationships-for-repeat-business-opportunities\">Nurturing Relationships for Repeat Business Opportunities</h3>\n<p>If you’re following our blueprint for a recessionary storm, you’re already nurturing your past buyers and sellers with consistent communication, exceptional care, market insights, and the like. Remember to regularly reach out to past clients through personalized emails or phone calls to check on their well-being and offer any assistance they may need.</p>\n<p>Share relevant market updates, home improvement tips, or local events that demonstrate your commitment to their success beyond the initial transaction. Gently encourage satisfied clients to refer you to their friends, family members, or colleagues who may be needing real estate services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"staying-informed-about-market-trends\">Staying Informed About Market Trends</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4227 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/c4f3acc585a6739b-555555.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/555555.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/555555-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Staying informed about market trends is crucial for talking to buyers and sellers and adapting your strategies. Keep an eye on key economic indicators such as interest rates, unemployment rates, and GDP growth that can impact the housing market.</p>\n<p>Stay updated on local inventory levels, average days on the market, and home prices in your area to better advise your clients. Attend industry conferences, webinars, or workshops to stay abreast of new technologies and emerging trends that can give you a competitive edge by more thoroughly understanding the impact of what is happening in the real estate business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"assisting-investors-with-distressed-property-acquisitions-or-short-sales\">Assisting investors with distressed property acquisitions or short sales</h3>\n<p>During a recession, there is often an increase in distressed properties available at discounted prices. This is one area that gets bigger &#8211; be ready for it! Real estate agents can position themselves as experts in assisting investors looking to acquire these properties or navigate short-sale transactions.</p>\n<p>By understanding the intricacies of distressed property deals and having access to relevant listings and resources, agents can provide valuable guidance and support to investors while earning commissions on successful transactions. This is a must-have education course.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collaborating-with-local-businesses-on-joint-marketing-initiatives\">Collaborating with local businesses on joint marketing initiatives</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4094 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e3a7ce21e1819287-8.webp/public\" alt=\"Local Business Collaboration - Friendly Interaction at a Bakery Checkout as a Real Estate Networking Opportunity\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Real estate agents can maximize their visibility and reach. One effective way is to collaborate with local businesses on joint marketing initiatives. How? Partner with complementary businesses such as mortgage brokers, home stagers, or interior designers, to increase the value you bring.</p>\n<p>Provide value to local businesses by advertising their companies on your Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook. Invite these companies to come to your open houses or “lunch and learn” gatherings where they can meet new customers too. This collaborative approach benefits everyone and fosters community during the recessional time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leverage-technology-to-streamline-operations\">Leverage Technology to Streamline Operations</h3>\n<p>Technology plays a vital role in streamlining operations and reaching clients &#8211; two critical factors for surviving a recession as a real estate agent. Invest in tools (while being careful about your expenses) that automate administrative tasks, such as customer relationship management (CRM) software and internet scheduling platforms.</p>\n<p>Some brokerages, like eXp Realty, even provide tools for automation that agents haven’t accessed yet. Now’s the time. Also, use virtual tours and video walkthroughs to showcase properties to clients who may not be able to attend in-person showings.</p>\n<p>And, don’t waste your time or efforts, embrace digital marketing strategies like search engine optimization (SEO) to increase your internet visibility. That’s the way to success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thought-a-big-overhaul-of-transitioning-to-a-digital-operation\">Final Thought &#8211; A Big Overhaul of Transitioning to a Digital Operation</h2>\n<p>Real estate agents must embrace technology to thrive in any economic climate &#8211; whether clear skies or hurricanes. With a digital operation, agents more easily become recession-proof as they reach a wider audience, and streamline processes, all while providing exceptional service.</p>\n<p>Use online marketing strategies like social media advertising with SEO search engine optimization and you can attract potential clients and establish yourself as an expert in the real estate industry.</p>\n<p>Transition by focusing on building a strong online presence through engaging content and interactive platforms. Leverage social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok.</p>\n<p>With those, you can showcase listings, share valuable insights about the real estate market, and connect with potential clients. Invest in user-friendly websites and mobile apps that make it easy for clients to browse listings and communicate with you directly.</p>\n<p>Remember &#8211; transitioning to a digital operation is not just about embracing technology; it&#8217;s about providing exceptional value and service to your customers.

That way real estate agents will attract more potential buyers. Here are some factors to consider when scheduling your open house:</p>\n<h4>Weekends Are Prime Time for Real Estate Agent Open Houses</h4>\n<p>Not surprisingly, weekends are the optimal choice as most people are free to come then. Therefore, Saturdays and Sundays tend to have higher attendance rates compared to weekdays.</p>\n<p>However, to take your open house to the next level, find out when most open homes are conducted in your area. Consider hosting your open house a bit before the other open houses in the area, or extend yours when others have closed.</p>\n<p>For example, if the “normal” time for holding open houses is 1 &#8211; 4 pm, do your open house from 12 &#8211; 3 pm or 2 &#8211; 5 pm. That way buyers who are planning to see lots of homes in a row will have more opportunities to attend your open house.</p>\n<p>By carefully selecting the right time and day for your real estate open house, you increase the chances of attracting more people and generating more real estate leads.</p>\n<h4>Research Local Events and Holidays</h4>\n<p>Before finalizing the open house date, research any local events or holidays happening nearby in the area. These can significantly impact attendance rates.</p>\n<p>For example, if there&#8217;s a major sporting event or festival occurring on a particular weekend near the area of your open house event, it might be best not to do an open house during that time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximize-advertising-channels-for-open-houses\">Maximize Advertising Channels for Open Houses</h3>\n<p>To ensure a successful open house, it&#8217;s crucial to <strong>maximize advertising</strong>. Whether you are the listing agent or not, advertising beyond listing the open house in your local MLS can attract more potential buyers to your open house.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/real-estate-in-a-digital-age\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">93% of homebuyers</a> use the internet in their open house search so make sure the listing agent has added the open house to your local MLS. That way your open house event will pop up on sites like Zillow.</p>\n<h4>Utilize Online Platforms for Your Open House Event</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4095 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a5c6ea90ae44dcd9-9.webp/public\" alt=\"Maximizing Reach on Social Media - Logos of Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok for Real Estate Content Creation\" width=\"434\" height=\"145\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9.webp 434w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-300x100.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px\" /></p>\n<p>Take advantage of the power of social media and your websites to advertise your open house. Create engaging posts or short-form videos for platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Twitter to reach a wider audience.</p>\n<p>Share attractive photos of the property along with compelling captions that highlight its unique features and, of course, make sure you are in the posts or videos too.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you’re the listing agent, create a dedicated webpage or landing page on your website where guests can find detailed information about the open house.</p>\n<h4>Send Email Invitations For Your Open House</h4>\n<p>Harness the power of email marketing by sending personalized invitations to buyers in your database as well as fellow realtors in your network. Craft compelling subject lines that grab attention and make sure to include enticing details about the open house in the body of the email.</p>\n<p>Don’t know what to say? Use ChatGPT to help you come up with a creative, fun invite. If you don’t know how to use ChatGPT, check out our other blogs.</p>\n<h4>Don’t Forget to Attract the Neighbors to Your Open House Event</h4>\n<p>Make a special neighborhood invitation flyer and mail it, drop it off on doorsteps, or door knock with it in the neighborhood. Tell neighbors that only neighbors are invited during that hour and include your business card.</p>\n<p>When they arrive at your open house, listen up! Neighbors can provide you with a wealth of information making you more of a neighborhood expert.</p>\n<p>Then you can provide that information to other guests at your open home, allowing you to provide more value and drive more conversations.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sometimes neighbors are people considering a move too. You might even pick up a seller lead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"efficient-open-house-record-keeping-with-digital-sign-in-open-house-sheets\">Efficient Open House Record Keeping with Digital Sign-In Open House Sheets</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4152 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3f92b2074f6b51ee-1-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-2.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-2-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Collecting visitor information</strong> at an open house is crucial for realtors, but keeping track of all those sign-in sheets and business cards can be a hassle. That&#8217;s where digital sign-in sheets come in handy!</p>\n<h4>Accurate Open House Data Collection Made Easy</h4>\n<p>With digital sign-in sheets, you collect guest data accurately and efficiently. Instead of relying on handwritten forms, leads can easily input their details into a secure platform. This ensures that you have the correct contact data without errors or missing fields.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, ask for each person’s name, phone number, email address, and whether they are working with an agent. For those not working with an agent, you can reach out at a later date to offer those visitors some type of value for their continued search.</p>\n<p>Other items you may want to ask include home addresses, if they plan to buy soon, months or years from now, if they are currently renting, or if they own their home. Having this data upfront will allow you to prioritize your follow-up organization.</p>\n<h4>What Digital Sign-In Should You Use For Your Open House Event</h4>\n<p>There are many options to choose from. Be sure to google it as well because it’s an ever-changing landscape. Here are some current ideas: Curb Hero, KVCore (note &#8211; KVCore is included in our $85 a month fee at eXp Realty while it costs others up to $500 per month), or Google Forms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"successful-open-house-tips-for-the-day-of-event\">Successful Open House Tips for the Day-of-Event<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4161\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cf62caae8bc34f51-Tips-Title-Image.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tips-Title-Image.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tips-Title-Image-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tips-Title-Image-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><!--more--></h2>\n<p>To make your open house a <strong>HUGE success,</strong> it&#8217;s important to follow some guidelines and execute some <strong>creative ideas</strong> that will attract guests and leave a lasting impression. Here are a few suggestions to consider:</p>\n<h3 id=\"set-up-open-house-signs-to-direct-people-to-the-home-and-advertise-you\">Set Up Open House Signs to Direct People to the Home &#038; Advertise YOU</h3>\n<p>Catch the attention of potential real estate leads by placing in advance eye-catching signs strategically around the neighborhood and further away to drive the public to the home. Generally, the more open house signs you set up, the more visitors you will attract to your open house.</p>\n<p>And, make sure your open house signs include your name and phone number. These signs will help advertise your name as a local realtor to all who see it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-an-inviting-atmosphere-with-fresh-scents-and-proper-lighting\">Create an Inviting Atmosphere with Fresh Scents &#038; Proper Lighting</h3>\n<p>Get to the open house early and make sure all rooms smell good and are well-lit. Open up windows for fresh airflow and turn on all the house lights. Open drapes and shutters. You want a clean fresh smell and as much light as possible so guests don’t get turned off right away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-engage-with-open-house-visitors\">How to Engage with Open House Visitors</h3>\n<p>As an agent hosting an open house, engaging with guests is something you want to do to build rapport and address any questions or concerns people may have. Be approachable, friendly, and knowledgeable about the property and its surrounding area.</p>\n<p>When attendees talk, be a good listener and provide clear answers to their inquiries without overwhelming them with unnecessary jargon. Building trust through effective communication is the way to go. It can greatly influence their decision-making process and help you build rapport.</p>\n<h3 id=\"provide-property-details-and-your-personal-brand-information\">Provide Property Details and Your Personal Brand Information</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4148 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/dca0adb442b1cc2c-3-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-2.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-2-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Start by providing free value immediately at the door &#8211; maybe hand each guest a map of all similar properties in the area with their price and other detailed information, or a list of the nearby schools, or other neighborhood information.</p>\n<p>Providing value right away increases the chance that open house guests will talk to you and that what you want, the chance to build rapport.</p>\n<p>Display detailed property information that is easy for open-house visitors to pick up and review on the spot or later after they’ve left. Provide personal brand handouts with your contact information, business card, and an introduction of you as a buyer’s agent.</p>\n<p>Be sure to include what unique value you bring as a real estate agent. Use a QR code with your links to your website, social media, or buyer’s guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"offering-guided-tours-highlighting-key-features-of-the-house\">Offering Guided Tours Highlighting Key Features of the House</h3>\n<p>Engage your guests by greeting them at the door and providing a guided home tour that showcases the unique selling points of the home. Chat with guests, answer their questions, and share the knowledge you know about the neighborhood. Provide value and you will build rapport.</p>\n<h3 id=\"offer-refreshments-to-make-visitors-feel-welcome\">Offer Refreshments to Make Visitors Feel Welcome</h3>\n<p>Okay, sometimes people just don’t want to talk to real estate agents. One way to break the ice with people and make them feel more open and welcome &#8211; and perhaps more talkative &#8211; is to offer refreshments during their visit. Provide simple snacks like cookies and water.</p>\n<p>This creates a positive experience, demonstrates hospitality, and encourages visitors to stay longer exploring the property and talking to you!</p>\n<h3 id=\"conducting-interactive-activities-such-as-raffles-or-giveaways\">Conducting Interactive Activities such as Raffles or Giveaways</h3>\n<p>Spice up your open house even more by organizing interactive activities like raffles or giveaways. This adds excitement and provides more opportunities for you to chat with people there and build a rapport.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collaborating-with-local-businesses-for-your-open-house\">Collaborating with Local Businesses for Your Open House</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4094 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e3a7ce21e1819287-8.webp/public\" alt=\"Local Business Collaboration - Friendly Interaction at a Bakery Checkout as a Real Estate Networking Opportunity\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Regarding those refreshments and giveaways, you don’t have to provide them yourself! They can be free for you! Collaborating with local businesses can help add value to your open house.</p>\n<p>Partner with nearby restaurants or cafes, title companies, and lenders to provide the needed refreshments and offer to display their business cards or other information.</p>\n<p>Also, collaborate with home improvement stores or interior designers to provide giveaways gift cards, or vouchers for their services. These collaborations not only enhance the overall experience of the open home but also demonstrate your commitment to supporting local businesses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collaborate-with-other-real-estate-agents-for-a-joint-open-home\">Collaborate with Other Real Estate Agents for a Joint Open Home</h3>\n<p>Teaming up with other real estate professionals who specialize in different areas or neighborhoods can expand your network and provide valuable opportunities for joint open houses.</p>\n<p>By combining resources and sharing marketing efforts, you can attract a larger pool of leads who are interested in various property types or locations. Check with your brokerage to make sure you are allowed to host an open house with an outside agent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exclusive-incentives-for-attendees\">Exclusive Incentives for Attendees</h3>\n<p>If you are the listing agent, offering exclusive incentives can create a sense of urgency and motivate prospective buyers to attend your open house. Consider providing discounts or upgrades for attendees who express genuine interest in the home.</p>\n<p>This could include offering reduced closing costs, covering home warranty fees, or even including certain furnishings or appliances as part of the deal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"livestreaming-the-open-house-on-social-media\">Live Streaming the Open House on Social Media</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4150\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9f0f02d6ea1a721e-5-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"332\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-1-300x100.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-1-768x255.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you have learned about hosting a successful real estate open house, it&#8217;s time to take your open house to the next level.

I mean goldmine! If you want to take your real estate career to the next level gaining real estate leads, this is an essential part of your lead generation strategy.</p>\n<p>What makes getting real estate leads from LinkedIn so compelling?  Why is it a special opportunity?  There are 4 main reasons:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-not-crowded-for-real-estate-leads\">1. Not Crowded for Real Estate Leads</h3>\n<p>Right, believe it or not, LinkedIn’s power is easier to access because there are not many realtors doing it.  So it’s not a crowded space.  Yes, of course, there are loads of real estate agents on LinkedIn!</p>\n<p>However, the vast majority don’t have a clue about using the platform for marketing to its greatest potential.  Instead, you’ll discover that generating LinkedIn real estate leads just isn&#8217;t as crowded as what you&#8217;ll find on other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.  That means there is an opportunity to be had.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-different-than-other-platforms\">2. Different than Other Platforms</h3>\n<p>Of course, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok do have their merits too. They absolutely do. But unlike those other platforms that focus on entertainment, LinkedIn is all about professional networking and building business relationships.</p>\n<p>Potential clients on LinkedIn expect value propositions over entertainment. So your goal of real estate leads is more aligned with people using LinkedIn than on other platforms. That means you can get real estate leads faster.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-targeted-audience-on-linkedin\">3. Targeted Audience on LinkedIn</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of using LinkedIn is its ability to help you reach a highly targeted audience through your profile and connections. LinkedIn allows you to filter your search based on specific criteria such as location, industry, job title, profile, source, and connections.</p>\n<p>This means you can find people who fit your ideal client profile and connect with them directly. By targeting the right connections, you increase your chances of converting real estate leads into actual clients.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-linkedins-statistical-advantage\">4. LinkedIn’s Statistical Advantage</h3>\n<p>Statistics don&#8217;t lie and they reveal the true power behind getting LinkedIn real estate leads. For instance, did you know that <strong>80% of B2B</strong> (business-to-business) leads come from LinkedIn connections? Wait! What? I know, it’s huge!</p>\n<p>Also, studies show that professionals with a strong profile and connections on LinkedIn have higher incomes compared to those on other social media sites. Whoa! Cool! That helps to get higher ticket sales.</p>\n<p>Last, check out this statistic about spending money on ads for LinkedIn real estate leads.  NewCred says that its LinkedIn marketing has <strong>6 times the ROI</strong> (that means return on investment) and <strong>75% lower cost</strong> per lead compared to Google AdWords.</p>\n<p>Really?  Wow! These statistics highlight how effective LinkedIn can be in attracting high-quality real estate leads &#8211; leads that translate into real estate transactions for you! Ok, so those stats aren’t derived from the free use of LinkedIn. We’ll cover some of the paid ways at the end of this article.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"complete-your-linkedin-profile\"> <strong>Complete Your LinkedIn Profile</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"999\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/84a7a88bfcf947f6-Leveraging-Profile.webp/public\" alt=\"Two professional men and two professional women showcasing effective LinkedIn profile pictures for real estate lead generation.\" class=\"wp-image-4115\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Leveraging-Profile.webp 999w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Leveraging-Profile-300x93.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Leveraging-Profile-768x239.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" /></figure>\n<p>To begin your journey to gaining real estate leads on LinkedIn, it&#8217;s essential to fully complete your profile.  Make sure you fill out every bit of your profile from your past related resumes, to your unique value, to your website and other social media links. Be sure to showcase your expertise in the real estate industry.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-professional-headshot\">1. Professional Headshot</h3>\n<p>Your profile picture is the first impression on LinkedIn. <strong>Choose a professional headshot</strong> that shows your face clearly. Smile in the photo so you appear approachable. Make sure the photo has <strong>good lighting</strong> and high resolution.</p>\n<p>Dress as you would for an important client meeting. This shows you understand real estate professionalism.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-add-real-estate-keywords\">2.  Add Real Estate Keywords</h3>\n<p>Now add relevant keywords throughout your profile.  That will enhance searchability so that people can find you! Add keywords like “real estate agent”, “realtor”, “homebuyer”, “home seller”, and your location, like “San Francisco real estate”, etc.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-add-personal-banner\">3. Add Personal Banner</h3>\n<p>Create a visually appealing banner with all the right information.  You can do this yourself, free on <strong>canva.com,</strong> or hire someone. <strong>Fiverr.com </strong>is a good place to find freelancers.  Make sure your banner has a compelling headline that highlights your role as a realtor and showcases your expertise as a real estate agent. Make your headline pop by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-ideas-create-eye-catching-linkedin-banner-sarah-clay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">following LinkedIn’s suggestions</a>. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-description\">4. Description</h3>\n<p>Write a concise and engaging summary that showcases your experience, skills, and unique selling points. Highlight any certifications or awards you have received within the field of real estate. Include specific details about the types of properties you specialize in or the areas you serve.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-endorsements-and-recommendations\">5. Endorsements &#038; Recommendations</h3>\n<p>Request recommendations and testimonials from satisfied clients who can vouch for the quality of service you provide.  Display endorsements from colleagues or industry professionals who can validate your expertise.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-updates\">6. Updates</h3>\n<p>Regularly update your profile with current sales statistics, new certifications, and other changes that occur over time.  Most people don’t update their profile very often.  Be different!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-add-a-button\">7. Add a Button</h3>\n<p>Add a LinkedIn Share Button to your company’s real estate website. With this button, your website users can easily share your content with their LinkedIn audience and networks. It’s free and easy to install. There are many options to create the button, one source is <strong>Sharethis.com</strong>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"content-for-realtors-to-gain-real-estate-leads\">Content for Realtors to Gain Real Estate Leads</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/8b431bb81fa4a17c-Compelling-Content.webp/public\" alt=\"Notebook with &#039;Content Strategy&#039; text next to a lightbulb and laptop, symbolizing innovative content planning for LinkedIn real estate marketing.\" class=\"wp-image-4113\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Compelling-Content.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Compelling-Content-300x148.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Compelling-Content-768x378.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Ok, now that you know why you want to use LinkedIn for real estate leads, let’s go over what your content can and should be:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Real Estate Information.</strong> Create and share a video about a specific neighborhood, market statistics, local businesses, and/or an introduction to your services.  Anything that provides value to the viewer.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Transaction Stories with images or videos.</strong>  Share your buying and selling success stories but focus on the story of how you helped your clients. Don’t just say you did the transaction, no one cares about your business. They care about the stories of obstacles overcome.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li> <strong>Recommendations &#038; Testimonials</strong>. Request recommendations and testimonials from satisfied clients who can vouch for the quality of service you provide. Make a post of it with a beautiful picture in the background.  Having other people sing your praises is best.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Trending News</strong>. If there is a real estate topic that is trending in the news, be sure to create content about that. For example, in 2022, prospective clients were very interested to hear how increasing interest rates might affect the housing market.  Now that’s creating value!</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Your Brokerage</strong>. Leverage your brokerage’s unique value. For example, eXp Realty includes Express Offers where sellers can get cash offers. That’s helpful for sellers to know.  Creating a post about that will draw out those looking to sell because the information is helpful for them.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Best Content</strong>.  This is about reviewing your content analytics to determine what content is getting more likes and views for you.  Once you know what your best content is, do more of that type of content.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-compelling-linkedin-content\">Create Compelling LinkedIn Content</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/f0d89d71498e145f-LinkedIn.webp/public\" alt=\"Hand holding a large magnet towards LinkedIn icon and cut-out figures, illustrating the power of LinkedIn in attracting real estate leads.\" class=\"wp-image-4117\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn-300x111.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn-768x284.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Ok, now that you know what to create, this is about how to make that content most compelling to get the most out of your efforts to get real estate leads on LinkedIn.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-engaging-posts\">1. <strong>Engaging Posts</strong></h3>\n<p>To make engaging posts, you need to craft posts that resonate with your target audience. To do that, you’ll need to understand their needs, interests, and pain points, and then you’ll tailor your content to address them directly. By doing that, you&#8217;ll capture their attention and keep them coming back for more. </p>\n<p>PRO TIP- If you don’t know your ideal prospective clients’ needs, interests, and pain points, ask <strong>ChatGPT</strong>.  And, if you don’t know how to do that, check out our blogs and videos about ChatGPT.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-visuals\">2. <strong>Visuals</strong></h3>\n<p>Use visuals, such as images or videos, to make your content more appealing. People are visual creatures, and incorporating eye-catching visuals will help grab their attention as they scroll through their feeds.</p>\n<p>For example, you can share photos of beautiful properties or create informative videos showcasing the latest real estate trends.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-engagement\">3. <strong>Engagement</strong></h3>\n<p>Encourage engagement by asking questions or prompting discussions in your posts. By initiating discussions through thought-provoking questions or inviting opinions from your audience, you&#8217;ll foster engagement and create a sense of community around your content.  We will go deeper into engagement below.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-hashtags\">4. <strong>Hashtags</strong></h3>\n<p>Include targeted hashtags related to real estate and your location of business in your posts to expand reach and attract potential clients. Try #realestate, #homebuyer, #luxuryhomes, etc…</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-quality\">5<strong>. Quality</strong></h3>\n<p>Remember that quality trumps quantity. Focus on creating high-quality posts rather than bombarding your audience with frequent but mediocre updates. Consistency is important but not at the expense of value.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"linkedin-real-estate-leads-with-engagement\"><strong>LinkedIn Real Estate Leads with Engagement</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e4cbf13b27dc9eb4-1.png/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4344\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1.png 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-300x171.png 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-768x438.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>To gain real estate leads, there is a proper way to engage. But, first, there is one overriding principle that will keep you on track &#8211; build meaningful relationships by offering value. Keep that in mind…always.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-proper-engagement\"><strong>1. Proper Engagement</strong></h3>\n<p>Let’s talk about how to properly engage with those who have engaged with you first by liking, commenting, or messaging you.  It’s time for you to build a relationship to gain a real estate lead.  Therefore, don’t ignore it when people merely “like” your content. </p>\n<p>And, don’t just say “thanks” when someone compliments your content.  Instead, plan to respond to their engagement in a meaningful and thoughtful way. </p>\n<p>To that end, start by viewing the profile and content of the person who engaged with you.  Ask them a sincere question about their work or find something to compliment them about &#8211; a genuine comment, not a fake one. </p>\n<p>Once that’s determined, comment back to them with a “thanks you for your comment and I really like the way you…” or “Thanks and I was looking at your profile and I’m wondering…”  Both approaches are thoughtful and much more likely to open further dialogue. </p>\n<p>Also, consider going the extra mile by sharing the content of others with your connections.  That is a sure way to get another person’s attention and let them know that you genuinely appreciate their work. </p>\n<p>That’s a huge compliment to other’s work without any words.  But use your words too like we already mentioned – in a meaningful and thoughtful way.</p>\n<p>Now that you’ve got the initial engagement going, keep the conversation going by stepping up your value proposition. Offer your support, insights, or resources that could benefit the connection or their audience.</p>\n<p>Here’s the key &#8211; by providing value without expecting anything in return, you establish trust and credibility. That is the way to real estate leads!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-more-engagement\"><strong>2. More Engagement</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you know how to properly engage, how can you create more of it?  Easy, reach out to your connections and start the engagement by commenting on their content.  Share some love with other people by reaching out with meaningful and thoughtful comments. </p>\n<p>That means you won’t just say “Nice post” or “Congrats”.  Instead, ask questions and make deeper comments that make it clear to your connection that you have completely read or watched their content. It takes effort. Keep your eye on the prize &#8211; real estate leads!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-increase-connections\"><strong>3. Increase Connections</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you’re engaging with your connections, you’ll want to increase your connections so that you’ll be able to engage with more people and find more real estate leads. To find more people to connect with, use Linkedin’s search bar to search for individuals and companies. </p>\n<p>You also can request connections with your network’s connections.  Do that by navigating to the profile of the person whose connections you want to view and tapping the number of connections below their profile.  Then just hit connect to anyone of interest that could result in more real estate leads.</p>\n<p>Last, LinkedIn’s premium service offers advanced search filters that allow you to narrow down your search based on various criteria such as location, industry, and job title. You can even find background information to identify potential clients.  LinkedIn’s premium service comes at a cost, but it can make this process of gaining real estate leads faster and potentially more effective.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-who-to-connect-with\"><strong>4. Who to Connect With</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you know how to increase your connections, it’s time to go over who you should request a connection from. Think about who are potential real estate leads or would have contact with other people who are real estate leads.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-real-estate-groups\"><strong>a.  Real Estate Groups</strong></h4>\n<p>Join groups relating to the real estate industry like real estate investment groups or real estate vendor groups by hitting the <strong>“Groups”</strong> button on LinkedIn’s navigation bar.  Then search for the groups by searching topics or keywords related to the group. </p>\n<p>Once found, go on to the Group&#8217;s profile page and click <strong>&#8220;Request to Join&#8221;</strong> to send a request to the Group Admins. The Group Admins reviews requests and may approve your membership.</p>\n<p>Once approved, contribute valuable insights and participate actively in discussions within the group. Share informative articles, blog posts, and industry updates.  Remember the overriding principle – build meaningful relationships by offering value!  That’s how to get real estate leads.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a group member, you can now message other group members. So, reach out to members with some proper engagement!</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-b-influential-people-businesses\"><strong>b. Influential People &#038; Businesses</strong></h4>\n<p>Connecting with local influential people and business is also great as collaborating with key players in the industry allows you to leverage each other&#8217;s networks and attract more real estate leads.</p>\n<p>Send connection requests to real estate industry people such as loan officers, escrow officers, home inspectors, title companies, local thought leaders, and industry experts.  Reach out first to individuals who have a significant number of followers and regularly share valuable content related to real estate.</p>\n<p>Once connected, explore collaboration opportunities that can help both of you including co-hosting webinars or events, contributing guest articles to each other&#8217;s blogs or newsletters, partnering up for joint marketing campaigns, or merely referring clients to each other.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-proper-connection-request\"><strong>5. Proper Connection Request</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you know who to request a connection with, how do you do it?  Because these are people that you don’t know, take the time to introduce yourself by sending a personal message along with your request to connect. </p>\n<p>Your message needs to follow the rules of proper engagement. Avoid generic messages that do not convey that you took the time to view their profile and content. It takes time and care to get real estate leads.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-engaging-without-connection\"><strong>6. Engaging without Connection</strong></h3>\n<p>We’ve covered how to reach out and request to connect with others so that you can begin the conversation.  However, there is also a way to begin the conversation even though you haven’t requested to connect with them or they haven’t accepted your connection request. How?</p>\n<p>With LinkedIn’s premium service, you can send <strong>InMails</strong> to anyone. InMails are like emails but they have a higher response rate compared to connection requests. That’s an advantage, but you’ll have to pay the price of LinkedIn’s premium service to get it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-steps-to-epic-linkedin-real-estate-leads\"><strong>5 Steps to EPIC LinkedIn Real Estate Leads</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/f97d37e1c84ee2e3-2.png/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4343\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2.png 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-300x171.png 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-768x438.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>This information focuses on maximizing real estate leads through LinkedIn advertising and sponsored content.  By utilizing these paid services, you can even more effectively reach your target audience and drive engagement that converts into real estate leads.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn is the champ when it comes to turning visitors into real estate leads. It boasts a 2.74% success rate of converting visitors into leads for both B2B and B2C audiences, which is way better than what you get from Facebook (0.77%) or Twitter (0.69%).</p>\n<p>Ok, let&#8217;s explore how you can maximize getting real estate leads on LinkedIn.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-advertising\"><strong>1. Advertising</strong></h3>\n<p>Utilize LinkedIn&#8217;s advertising features to target specific demographics of potential real estate leads. That is, you can use <strong>text &#038; banner ads</strong> to promote your services and capture the attention of your target audience. </p>\n<p>You can also use LinkedIn&#8217;s advanced targeting options to narrow down your audience based on factors such as location, industry, job title, and more. Experiment with different ad formats to see which ones resonate best with your target real estate leads audience.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-sponsored-content\"><strong>2. Sponsored Content</strong></h3>\n<p>Create compelling sponsored content that drives engagement and captures real estate leads. Craft engaging posts that provide valuable information about the real estate market or offer tips for home buyers/sellers.</p>\n<p>Include eye-catching visuals such as high-quality images or videos to grab attention. Use a clear call-to-action (CTA) in your posts, encouraging users to click, share, or provide their contact information for more details. Viola, those are real estate leads!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-analytics\"><strong>3. Analytics</strong></h3>\n<p>Leverage LinkedIn&#8217;s analytics to track the effectiveness of your advertising campaigns. Monitor key metrics such as impressions, clicks, shares, and conversions to gauge the performance of your ads.</p>\n<p>Identify trends or patterns in user behavior to optimize future campaigns for better results toward your goal of real estate leads. Use A/B testing to compare different ad variations and determine which ones are most effective at capturing real estate leads.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-budget-maximization\"><strong>4. Budget Maximization</strong></h3>\n<p>Make the most of your money by optimizing your ads and sponsored content based on performance data.   See what’s doing great and what’s not doing so great.  Allocate more budget towards ads consistently generating high click-through rates (CTR) or conversions.</p>\n<p>Continuously refine your targeting criteria based on data insights to ensure you&#8217;re reaching the right audience to get real estate leads. Regularly review and adjust bidding strategies to maximize your return on investment (ROI).</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-linkedin-premium\"><strong>5. LinkedIn Premium</strong></h3>\n<p>Ok, we already touched on LinkedIn premium services &#8211; which come at a cost. However, there’s even more to LinkedIn Premium than advanced searching and the ability to message anyone. That is, LinkedIn Premium lets you know who is looking at your profile.</p>\n<p>Knowing who is looking at your profile is useful information as that LinkedIn member could be a high-quality real estate lead, someone considering doing business with you. If they are, put the wheels in motion to properly engage with them.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wrapping-it-up\">Wrapping it Up</h2>\n<p>Congratulations on completing the sections on harnessing the power of LinkedIn for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-use-linkedin-real-estate-leads-dave-byrnes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate leads</a>!

Let&#8217;s explore these lead generation strategies.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4074\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/eba2b577f67a6e07-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"170\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-300x51.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-768x131.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"hosting-open-houses\">Hosting Open Houses</h3>\n<p>Open houses allow agents to showcase properties and engage with prospective clients. By creating a welcoming atmosphere and offering valuable information about the property, new agents can build rapport and establish connections with active buyers.</p>\n<h4>How to host open houses?</h4>\n<p>Check with other agents at your brokerage and ask if you can hold an open house for their listings. New agents can also hold open houses for agents of another brokerage if local and state rules allow it.</p>\n<p>Get open house signs highlighting your name. To save on expenses, borrow another agent’s signs and tape your name to the front. Place signs in 2 to 8 places directing people to the house while, at the same time, getting your name in front of viewers.</p>\n<h4>PROs:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Active Leads</strong>: Open houses can attract buyers actively searching for properties. Be sure to determine whether they are already working with an agent.</li>\n<li><strong>Face-to-Face Interaction</strong>: Open houses allow agents to establish personal connections with potential clients, answer their questions, and address their concerns directly, building trust.</li>\n<li><strong>Networking</strong>: Open houses can attract other local real estate agents and professionals, providing opportunities for networking and collaboration.</li>\n<li><strong>Exposure</strong>: They increase the visibility of the property, potentially attracting interested buyers who may not have seen the listing online or through traditional marketing.<strong>CONs:</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Security Concerns</strong>: Opening a property to the public carries some security risks. Agents need to ensure their own safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Low Conversion Rates</strong>: The conversion rate from open house attendees to actual clients can be relatively low. Many people attend open houses merely out of curiosity or to gather design ideas.</li>\n<li><strong>Competition</strong>: In competitive markets, there may be multiple open houses happening simultaneously, diluting the pool of potential visitors.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"contacting-expired-listing-owners\">Contacting Expired Listing Owners</h3>\n<p>Expired listings refer to properties that were listed on the market but did not sell within the designated contractual timeframe. These homeowners already tried to sell their homes so they are a great source of people who are selling.</p>\n<h4>How to gain expired listings?</h4>\n<p>New agents can generally find expired listings on their local multiple listing service (MLS). New agents can send a letter to the homeowner’s address (if the homeowner lives there) or use the property’s tax records for the homeowner’s address. Internet searches can also yield phone numbers and email addresses for a more direct approach.</p>\n<h4>PROs:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Motivated Sellers</strong>: Expired listings often indicate sellers still seeking a successful sale. This can lead to quicker transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Proven Market</strong>: The property has a known market history, making it easier to assess its value and marketability.</li>\n<li><strong>Opportunity to Showcase Skills</strong>: Successfully converting expired listings into sold properties can demonstrate your effectiveness as a real estate agent and boost your credibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Established Contact</strong>: The property owner has already shown an interest in selling, making initial contact potentially more receptive.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>CONs:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Seller Skepticism</strong>: Sellers of expired listings may be skeptical or frustrated with the previous agent&#8217;s efforts, making them less trusting and more challenging to work with.</li>\n<li><strong>Price Expectations</strong>: Some sellers have unrealistic price expectations, making it difficult to set a competitive listing price that aligns with market conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Market Changes</strong>: The property may have been listed during a different market climate, and market conditions may have shifted since then, affecting its value.</li>\n<li><strong>Competition with Other Agents</strong>: Other agents may also be targeting expired listings, increasing competition.</li>\n<li><strong>Time and Effort</strong>: Pursuing expired listings requires significant time and effort to research, make contact, and negotiate with the sellers.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"for-sale-by-owner-fsbo\">For Sale By Owner (FSBO)</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4091 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/efbd51d8a940965a-5.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"423\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5.webp 423w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-300x202.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" /></p>\n<p>Another strategy for finding free leads is through For Sale By Owner (FSBO) properties. These are properties where homeowners choose to sell without the assistance of a real estate agent, generating leads.</p>\n<h4>How to gain FSBO listings?</h4>\n<p>Find FSBOs on Zillow. Homeowner phone numbers will be there too. Prep a script and call the homeowner with your unique value proposition. Provide the stats that show that homes sold by agents sell for more, <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/quick-real-estate-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">linked here.</a></p>\n<h4>PROs:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Motivated Sellers</strong>: FSBO sellers are often motivated to sell their homes potentially leading to quicker transactions.</li>\n<li><strong>Direct Contact</strong>: You have direct access to the homeowner, allowing for personal communication and the opportunity to build rapport.</li>\n<li><strong>Market Knowledge</strong>: Researching FSBO listings can help you gain in-depth knowledge of local market conditions, property values, and seller motivations.</li>\n<li><strong>Less Competition</strong>: There may be fewer agents competing for the business of FSBO sellers, increasing your chances of securing the listing.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>CONs:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Skeptical Sellers</strong>: FSBO sellers may be skeptical of real estate agents and may have decided to go the FSBO route to avoid paying commissions.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Listings</strong>: FSBO listings represent a small portion of the market so yield a limited lead pool.</li>\n<li><strong>Educational Effort</strong>: You’ll likely need to invest time to educate FSBO sellers on the value of your services.</li>\n<li><strong>Uncertain Pricing</strong>: FSBO sellers may have more unrealistic price expectations than your “normal” home sellers.

You can find interested sellers considering selling their home but who haven’t yet reached out to a realtor.</p>\n<h4>How to approach door-knocking?</h4>\n<p>Pick a neighborhood &#8211; starting with your own may be best. Approach door knocking with confidence and professionalism, offering value and demonstrating your expertise.</p>\n<p>Know the neighborhood, the current home sales, and which homes are currently on the market. Share your knowledge.</p>\n<h4>PROs:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Personal Connection</strong>: Face-to-face interactions help you quickly establish a personal connection with homeowners and potential clients building trust and rapport.</li>\n<li><strong>Immediate Feedback</strong>: You can quickly gauge homeowners&#8217; interest and gather feedback on their real estate needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Lead Qualification</strong>: Engaging with homeowners in person allows you to pre-qualify potential leads based on their readiness to sell or buy, saving time and effort.</li>\n<li><strong>Differentiation</strong>: Door knocking sets you apart from competitors. It can be a unique and memorable way to make an impression.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>CONs:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Rejection</strong>: Door knocking often involves facing rejection on the spot &#8211; thick skin is needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Privacy Concerns</strong>: Some homeowners may view your knock as an intrusion leading them to be negative.</li>\n<li><strong>Weather and Safety</strong>: Inclement weather conditions and safety concerns, especially when door-knocking in unfamiliar areas, can be significant challenges.</li>\n<li><strong>Limited Hours</strong>: Door knocking is typically effective during specific hours (e.g., evenings and weekends).</li>\n<li><strong>Legal Restrictions</strong>: Some areas may have local ordinances or restrictions on door-to-door solicitation. Know the local rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"utilizing-online-classifieds-platforms\">Utilizing Online Classifieds Platforms</h3>\n<p>Online classifieds platforms like Craigslist can be a valuable resource for finding potential free leads.

When a lead contacts you, you’ll need to know information about the home and be prepared to show it to them.</p>\n<h4>PROs:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Wide Audience</strong>: Craigslist has a large and diverse user base, increasing the potential reach of your ads.</li>\n<li><strong>Local Focus</strong>: You can target specific geographic areas or neighborhoods.</li>\n<li><strong>Direct Communication</strong>: Craigslist allows for direct communication with potential clients, allowing you to respond to inquiries promptly and personally.<strong>CONs:</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Scams and Fraud</strong>: Craigslist is known for scams and fraudulent listings, which can make some users wary of engaging with agents on the platform.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality Control</strong>: There is limited quality control on Craigslist, which means that the platform may not attract high-quality leads.</li>\n<li><strong>Changing Algorithms</strong>: Craigslist frequently updates its algorithms and posting rules, which can affect your efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Time-Consuming</strong>: Responding to inquiries and weeding out unqualified leads can be time-consuming.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"modern-ways-to-gain-free-leads\">Modern Ways to Gain Free Leads</h2>\n<p>In today&#8217;s digital age, there are several modern ways for new agents to advertise and generate free leads.

Depending on various factors such as the size of your network and the level of engagement you have with them, it may take several months or even longer before you start seeing significant results.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-social-media-really-effective-for-generating-realtor-leads\">Is social media effective for generating realtor leads?</h3>\n<p>Yes! Social media platforms provide an excellent opportunity for new agents to showcase their expertise, connect with potential clients, and build brand awareness.</p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to approach social media marketing strategically by consistently posting valuable content and engaging with your audience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-generate-high-quality-leads-solely-through-traditional-methods\">Can I generate high-quality leads solely through traditional methods?</h3>\n<p>While traditional methods like working your sphere can yield high-quality leads over time, it&#8217;s essential to diversify your lead generation efforts by incorporating modern strategies as well.

Agents pay up to 35% of their closed commission for OpCity leads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-leads-and-lead-generation\">What are leads and lead generation?</h3>\n<p>Exclusive leads are leads where the provider agrees to only provide that lead or leads in a particular geographical area to a single agent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-new-realtors-need-to-know-about-leads\">What new realtors need to know about leads.</h3>\n<p>New agents need to know that lead generation is their number 1 focus and, that if they don’t learn to do it themselves, they will never be running their own business.</p>\n<p>If a new agent became a realtor because they wanted to be an entrepreneur, relying on brokerage leads or leads from a team won’t get them there. Those agents will always be working for someone else.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-do-realtors-fail\">Why do realtors fail?</h3>\n<p>Realtors need to learn new skills to gain leads and provide exceptional service to clients they have to get repeat and referral business over time. Being successful requires diligence to serve, caring about others, and staying consistent with their lead generation approaches</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-leads-and-lead-generation-2\">What are leads and lead generation?</h3>\n<p>In real estate, leads are individuals who may be potential clients for a realtor. Lead generation includes the activities that real estate agents do or pay for to get lists of potential clients. Turning a lead into a client requires nurturing, time, skill, and consistency.</p>\n",

Go back to the beginning of your prompt and type something like: “Make an outline of the following”: Pro tip &#8211; tell ChatGPT to provide additional context regarding specific sections that you want to understand in more depth.</p>\n<h3>3. Marketing Your Listings</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4040 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/2862aeea5e920498-Marketing-Your-Listings.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"285\" height=\"277\" title=\"\"></p>\n<p>With the help of ChatGPT&#8217;s capabilities, real estate agents can craft better-personalized property listing descriptions that engage your audience and stand out from the competition. Try these different strategies to market your property and let ChatGPT help you with all of them:</p>\n<h4><strong>Write a Captivating Listing Description:</strong></h4>\n<p>Provide ChatGPT with the key features, nearby attractions, and any specific details you want to highlight. ChatGPT will weave them into a compelling description that not only informs but also evokes emotion and urgency. This is your first step to creating irresistible flyers!</p>\n<h4><strong>Rewrite a Listing Description:</strong></h4>\n<p>If a property isn&#8217;t getting the attention it deserves, it&#8217;s time for a makeover. ChatGPT can help you refresh the listing description, changing the style and approach to attract a new audience and rekindle interest.</p>\n<h4><strong>Personalized Email Campaigns:</strong></h4>\n<p>Connect with potential buyers or sellers through email. Start with a warm introduction, show genuine interest in their needs, and then let ChatGPT craft a personalized property description that grabs their attention and keeps them reading.</p>\n<h4><strong>Catchy Flyer to Invite Neighbors to the Open House:</strong></h4>\n<p>Provide ChatGPT with some neighborhood facts and ask it to craft thoughts and language to attract the neighbors to your open house.</p>\n<h4><strong>More Creative Ideas You Haven’t Even Thought Of:</strong></h4>\n<p>Turn over even more gems by asking ChaptGPT to give you 10 ways to market a real estate listing.</p>\n<h3>4. Social Media Scripts</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4041 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/badb10fe8c4fe8e7-Social-Media-Scripts.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Social-Media-Scripts.webp 426w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Social-Media-Scripts-300x201.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" /></p>\n<p>Whether you’re a pro or new to social media, ChatGPT is here to help you. By asking specifically for the type of idea you want, you can get tailored suggestions that suit your needs. Use ChatGPT to help you complete the following steps.</p>\n<h4>Generate ideas</h4>\n<p>ChatGPT can give you fresh video topics you should do. Try: give me 10 ideas for a YouTube video to provide home buyer tips from a realtor in Sacramento, California. Pro tip &#8211; if you don’t like the results or you want more, ask “Give me 5 more and this time make them all about how to deal with inspection reports”</p>\n<h4>Write posts and scripts</h4>\n<p>Not only does ChatGPT excel in generating ideas, but it&#8217;s also your go-to resource for crafting engaging YouTube and short-form video scripts. Specify whether it&#8217;s a YouTube script or a script for short-form videos like TikTok or Reels. This way, you&#8217;ll receive ideas and suggestions that are suitable for video formats.</p>\n<p>To utilize ChatGPT for scriptwriting, simply provide it with the necessary facts and let it work its magic. For example, if you&#8217;re creating a video about the top neighborhoods in your city, you can ask ChatGPT questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;What are the best neighborhoods for families?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Which areas offer the most affordable housing options?&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Can you provide insights on up-and-coming neighborhoods?&#8221; Pro tip &#8211; ask ChatGPT to generate content in your preferred style of speech. Whether you want a formal tone or a more casual approach, ChatGPT can adapt to meet your needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on these prompts, ChatGPT will generate results that you can use as starting points for your scripts. Pro Tip &#8211; Ask more follow-up questions until you get the long-form content you want.</p>\n<h4>Repurpose Scripts to Make Shorter Scripts</h4>\n<p>You can drop your final script into ChatGPT and ask it to make a short description of your script highlighting the key points. Ask ChatGPT to shorten the result, or lengthen it or any other way you want it tweaked.</p>\n<h3>5. Social Media Descriptions</h3>\n<p>To effectively promote your real estate business on social media, it&#8217;s essential to write captivating and concise descriptions that grab the attention of potential clients. Ask ChatGPT to keep your descriptions short and sweet, using simple language because when writing social media descriptions, brevity and easy-to-understand language is key.</p>\n<h3>6. Social Media Keywords and Tags</h3>\n<p>To make your online content more discoverable, it&#8217;s important to use the right keywords and tags. These are words or phrases that people might search for when looking for results related to real estate. By using relevant keywords and tags, you can increase the chances of your content appearing in search engine results.</p>\n<p>Find the best keywords before you write your script. Just ask ChatGPT to find the best keywords for the topic of your choice. After your script is complete, drop that back into ChatGPT and ask it to find you the best tags.</p>\n<h3>7. Tough Comments or Emails</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4042 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cf60f5d371a87dd4-Tough-Comments-or-Emails.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tough-Comments-or-Emails.webp 426w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tough-Comments-or-Emails-300x201.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" /></p>\n<p>Getting negative comments on your social media or other communications that leave you stumped on how to best answer it? Dealing with tough comments or emails can be challenging, especially for realtors who are looking to maintain a positive and professional image.</p>\n<p>However, with the help of ChatGPT, you can craft creative answers that address concerns while keeping the conversation constructive. Some tips to ask ChatGPT to do:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Acknowledge and Empathize” &#8211; When faced with difficult feedback, it&#8217;s essential to acknowledge the person&#8217;s concerns and show empathy. Tell ChatPGT to use phrases like &#8220;I understand how you feel&#8221; or &#8220;I hear your frustration,&#8221; to demonstrate that you value their perspective and are willing to listen.</li>\n<li>“Provide Clear Explanations” &#8211; One way to address tough comments is by providing clear explanations. Use simple language and avoid jargon so that your response is easily understood. Break down complex material into smaller, digestible pieces to ensure clarity.</li>\n<li>“Offer Solutions or Alternatives” &#8211; Instead of just acknowledging the issue, offer practical solutions or alternatives. This shows your commitment to resolving problems and helps build trust with your clients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>8. Phone &#038; FSBO Scripts</h3>\n<p>In the world of real estate, effective communication is key. As a realtor, you need to have persuasive scripts ready for various situations. Whether you&#8217;re making general phone calls or specific ones like For Sale By Owner (FSBO), having the right words can make all the difference and ChatGPT can help you out. Ask ChatGPT to meet these criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Be confident and enthusiastic”: Show your passion for helping people buy or sell their homes.</li>\n<li>“Ask open-ended questions”: Engage the person in a conversation by asking questions that require more than just a yes or no answer.</li>\n<li>“Highlight your expertise”: Share your knowledge about the local market and any recent successful transactions.</li>\n<li>“Build rapport”: Begin by establishing a friendly connection with the homeowner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>9. Customer Service for Tricky Situations</h3>\n<p>Let ChatGPT help you navigate tough situations. Tell ChatGPT the situation and ask for guidance and replies using the following tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Be empathetic”. Empathy is key. It means understanding and sharing the feelings of your clients. By putting yourself in their shoes, you can better understand their needs and concerns.</li>\n<li>“Offer solutions”: Provide alternative options or strategies to resolve issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>10. General Marketing ideas</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT can help you do your job better in endless ways. Consider the following ideas and let that provide you with the vast information you can access with this crazy helpful tool of ChatGPT:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Write my biography better, be more persuasive and fun”</li>\n<li>“Provide 10 ways to market myself as a realtor in Dallas Texas”</li>\n<li>“Give me 10 ideas for gifts for real estate buyer and seller clients”</li>\n<li>“Tell me 10 ways to show appreciation to my clients besides buying them gifts”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"alternatives-to-chatgpt\">Alternatives to ChatGPT</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4044\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/06af91f6f367085e-Alternatives-to-ChatGPT.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"388\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alternatives-to-ChatGPT.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alternatives-to-ChatGPT-300x116.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Alternatives-to-ChatGPT-768x298.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<h3>Other Options for Realtors</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a realtor looking for alternatives to ChatGPT, there are a few options worth considering. These alternatives can help you provide excellent customer care, enhance communication with clients, and improve your overall efficiency.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BARD</strong> &#8211; A relatively new entrant, BARD is a free AI-based writing assistant that offers a variety of content-generation options.</li>\n<li><strong>Wit.ai</strong> &#8211; Geared towards developers, it provides natural language processing tools that can be adapted for content creation, albeit with a steep learning curve.</li>\n<li><strong>Hugging Face&#8217;s Transformers</strong> &#8211; This is more on the technical side and requires coding knowledge, but it&#8217;s highly customizable for specific content needs.</li>\n<li><strong>AI21&#8217;s Studio</strong> &#8211; Offers a free plan with limited features but is effective for small content creation tasks.</li>\n<li><strong>Quillbot</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s generally used for rephrasing or summarizing content but can also be a good starting point for generating new content.</li>\n<li><strong>Text Blaze</strong> &#8211; This is a free Chrome extension that allows you to create and save text snippets. Though not an AI writer, it can save you time by storing commonly used phrases or sentences.</li>\n<li><strong>Trello&#8217;s Butler</strong> &#8211; While not a direct competitor in content creation, Butler can automate workflows related to content management, which can indirectly support your writing process.</li>\n<li><strong>Cortx&#8217;s Wordtune</strong> &#8211; A free writing assistant that helps you improve and streamline sentences. Useful for refining already existing content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-not-to-use-chatgpt-for-realtors\">How Not to use ChatGPT for realtors</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4039\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3ba48f85f91eec4a-How-Not-to-use-ChatGPT-for-realtors.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"339\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/How-Not-to-use-ChatGPT-for-realtors.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/How-Not-to-use-ChatGPT-for-realtors-300x102.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/How-Not-to-use-ChatGPT-for-realtors-768x260.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<h3>Don’t use ChatGPT for Blog Writing</h3>\n<p>While ChatGPT offers powerful content generation capabilities, realtors should exercise caution when using it to write blog articles. The platform can lack the personal touch, local insights, and depth of analysis that a seasoned realtor brings.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there are ethical considerations, SEO limitations, and potential inaccuracies to account for. Ultimately, it&#8217;s advisable to use ChatGPT as a supplemental tool for initial drafts or brainstorming, rather than relying on it exclusively for crafting professional, high-ranking articles.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Include Personal information in ChatGPT Prompts</h3>\n<p>Users should refrain from including personal data in their prompts to ChatGPT. First, the platform isn&#8217;t designed to handle sensitive data securely, and any personal data could potentially be exposed or stored in a manner that is not entirely private.</p>\n<p>Second, OpenAI retains user interactions for training and research purposes, which means personal data could be used in a manner the user did not intend.</p>\n<p>Finally, there&#8217;s the risk of misuse or misinterpretation of such sensitive information. For these reasons, it&#8217;s always best to anonymize any data or personal details before inputting it into ChatGPT or any other AI writing tool.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Use ChatGPT Replies Without Serious Consideration</h3>\n<p>Users should always read and think critically about ChatGPT&#8217;s answers for several important reasons. First, while the AI is designed to provide accurate and helpful information, it&#8217;s not infallible and can occasionally produce incorrect or misleading content. Critical evaluation ensures the information aligns with your specific needs and is factual.</p>\n<p>Second, an answer from ChatGPT may lack nuanced understanding or context that a human expert would consider, potentially making it less applicable to unique or complex situations.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a thoughtful review of the AI&#8217;s responses enables you to tailor the content to your own voice or brand, ensuring consistency and authenticity in any public-facing material. Therefore, always consider ChatGPT&#8217;s output as a starting point for further research and customization, rather than as a definitive answer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-chatgpt-weaknesses\">What are ChatGPT&#8217;s Weaknesses?</h2>\n<h3>Limited Customization Options</h3>\n<p>One of the downsides of using ChatGPT for realtors is the limited customization options. While it can generate text based on prompts, it doesn&#8217;t have a deep understanding of the real estate industry or specific market nuances. This means that the responses may not always be accurate or tailored to your needs as a realtor.</p>\n<h3>Potential Misinterpretation</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT relies on pre-existing data and patterns to generate responses. However, this also means that it can sometimes misinterpret queries or provide incorrect information. As a realtor, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure that the information you provide to clients is accurate and reliable. Relying solely on ChatGPT may lead to misunderstandings or misinformation.</p>\n<h3>Lack of Emotional Intelligence</h3>\n<p>One significant drawback of using ChatGPT for realtors is its lack of emotional intelligence. Real estate transactions often involve emotions and personal connections with clients. While ChatGPT can generate text-based responses, it lacks the empathy and understanding that human interactions bring. Building trust and rapport with clients may be challenging when relying solely on AI-generated conversations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, ChatGPT offers numerous opportunities for realtors to streamline their workflow and enhance their communication with clients. From writing emails and texts to generating new ideas for social marketing, this AI-powered tool can save time and boost productivity. It allows realtors to personalize property listings, create email drip campaigns, summarize long documents into outlines, and even draft printed marketing material. ChatGPT can assist in customer service by providing empathetic responses in tricky situations while building rapport with clients. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations of ChatGPT. While it can generate creative answers to tough comments or emails, it may not always provide accurate or contextually appropriate responses. Therefore, it is crucial for realtors to use the tool judiciously and consider alternative approaches when necessary.</p>\n<h2>Learn more about eXp Realty &#038; our FREE Sponsorship Team</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Generative AI, also known as generative artificial intelligence, is a fascinating field that involves creating models capable of content creation.</p>\n<p>These models are trained on vast amounts of data and use complex algorithms to produce outputs that resemble a human content writer. In simpler terms, generative AI enables machines to create original text, images, or even music.</p>\n<p>It does this by being logical and looking to fill in the answer to “If this, then that”.</p>\n<h3>Importance of prompt engineering in achieving desired outputs</h3>\n<p>When working with generative AI models like ChatGPT, great prompts are what it is all about! A prompt is an input given to the model that instructs it on what kind of output to generate. By carefully crafting prompts, we can guide the model towards producing specific responses, basically getting the results that you are seeking.</p>\n<p>These “prompts” are referred to as prompt engineering and they involve formulating prompts in a way that elicits the desired information or response from the model. It requires understanding how the model interprets and processes input data.</p>\n<p>By providing clear instructions and context through well-designed prompts, we can influence the output generated by the model.</p>\n<h3>How ChatGPT Generates Responses</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT processes input data using advanced machine-learning techniques. When ChatGPT receives input, it follows these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Data Interpretation</strong>: GPT first interprets the data it receives. This involves understanding the context, the query&#8217;s nature, and any specific details or instructions it contains.The model uses its trained neural network to process the text, identifying key elements such as the topic, intent, and any relevant entities.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Processing</strong>: After interpreting the input, GPT processes it using its underlying AI and machine learning algorithms. This processing involves generating a response that aligns with the input&#8217;s context and intent.It&#8217;s achieved through a technique known as &#8220;transformer-based machine learning,&#8221; where the model predicts the next word in a sequence based on the words that come before it.</li>\n<li><strong>Response Generation</strong>: Finally, GPT generates a relevant response based on its training and the processed data. This step involves selecting the most appropriate words and phrases to construct a coherent and contextually relevant answer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ChatGPT&#8217;s ability to perform these tasks effectively relies on its extensive training in a wide range of data, enabling it to understand and respond to a variety of inputs accurately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-start-using-chatgpt-today\">How to Start Using ChatGPT Today</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4024\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d65958a00bf60197-How-to-Start-Using-ChatGPT-Today.webp/public\" alt=\"Futuristic AI Bot Using Laptop - Guide to Starting with ChatGPT in Real Estate Today\" width=\"1000\" height=\"485\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/How-to-Start-Using-ChatGPT-Today.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/How-to-Start-Using-ChatGPT-Today-300x146.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/How-to-Start-Using-ChatGPT-Today-768x372.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Ok, let’s get into learning the skills needed to master ChatGPT.

By integrating these techniques into your interactions with ChatGPT, you can harness its full potential while ensuring ethical and effective usage. Here are key practices and examples to master ChatGPT:</p>\n<h3><strong>Clarity and Specificity</strong>:</h3>\n<p>Be direct and explicit in your prompts. Precise language and specific instructions help the model generate more targeted responses. Avoid ambiguity as ambiguous queries can lead to unintended or undesired responses from ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>By giving clear instructions or setting the context at the beginning of the conversation, you can guide the model&#8217;s responses effectively. Also, avoid asking broad or vague questions. Be as specific as possible. This helps ChatGPT provide more accurate and relevant responses tailored to your needs.</p>\n<h4>Example of Clarity and Specificity</h4>\n<p>Let’s say a real estate agent is seeking to use ChatGPT for writing a property description. The quality and relevance of the output will be better by being clear and specific in their request. Here&#8217;s an example of how to frame such a prompt:</p>\n<p>&#8220;ChatGPT, please write a detailed property description for a listing. The property is a 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom single-family home located at 123 Main Street, Springfield. Key features include a recently renovated kitchen with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances, a spacious living room with a fireplace, hardwood flooring throughout, and a landscaped backyard with a patio. The neighborhood is family-friendly, with easy access to schools, parks, and shopping centers. Highlight these features compellingly and attractively for potential buyers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In this prompt, the real estate agent provides specific information about the property, including its type, location, key features, and the surrounding neighborhood. This level of detail enables ChatGPT to generate a more tailored and accurate property description.</p>\n<h3><strong>Contextual Information</strong>:</h3>\n<p>Include relevant background details to set the scene for your query. Providing context is crucial for obtaining accurate and relevant responses from ChatGPT.</p>\n<h4>Example of Contextual Information</h4>\n<p>Let’s say a real estate agent uses contextual information to instruct ChatGPT about crafting a client email about a new property. Here&#8217;s an example of how to frame the prompt:</p>\n<p>&#8220;ChatGPT, I need you to draft an email for one of my clients, Alex Johnson, who is interested in modern, spacious homes in the downtown area. The property is located at 456 Cityview Lane, a prime downtown location. It&#8217;s a 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom house with an open floor plan, a large kitchen with state-of-the-art appliances, and a rooftop terrace offering a stunning city view. Alex has a young family and enjoys contemporary design. Please include details that would appeal to them, such as proximity to schools and parks, as well as the home&#8217;s modern amenities and spacious layout. The tone should be professional yet friendly, emphasizing how this property aligns with their preferences and lifestyle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In this prompt, the agent provides specific details about the client&#8217;s preferences, the property, and the desired tone of the email. This allows ChatGPT to create personalized and effective communication tailored to the client&#8217;s interests.</p>\n<h3><strong>Managing Randomness</strong>:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4025 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ba1049adde109aad-Managing-Randomness.webp/public\" alt=\"Preventing Missteps in AI: Hand Stopping Domino Effect Represents Managing Randomness in ChatGPT Answers\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Managing-Randomness.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Managing-Randomness-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Adjust the AI&#8217;s temperature settings to balance creativity and predictability in responses. Lower temperatures yield more predictable results, while higher settings increase randomness.</p>\n<h4>Example of Managing Randomness</h4>\n<p>To manage randomness when requesting ChatGPT to write an Instagram post about the benefits of homeownership over renting, a real estate agent can provide specific guidance on the content creation and tone of the post. Here&#8217;s an example prompt:</p>\n<p>&#8220;ChatGPT, I need an engaging Instagram post for potential homebuyers. The post should focus on the advantages of owning a home compared to renting. Please include points on building equity, the freedom to customize the property, and potential tax benefits. Aim for a positive and motivating tone, suitable for a broad audience. Include a call to action encouraging followers to reach out for more information on homeownership. Avoid overly technical language and keep the post concise and relatable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This prompt is specific about the content (benefits of homeownership), the tone (positive and motivating), the audience (broad), and the structure (including a call-to-action). By providing these details, the agent can reduce the randomness in ChatGPT&#8217;s response and ensure the post aligns with their marketing goals.</p>\n<h3><strong>Experiment with Prompts</strong>:</h3>\n<p>Utilize different prompts to get the desired output from ChatGPT. Experimentation helps you understand how the model responds to different inputs and prompts.</p>\n<h4>Example of Experimenting with Prompts</h4>\n<p>Real estate agents can use various prompts to request a motivation statement from ChatGPT. Each prompt can lead to different responses based on its specificity and context. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>General Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, can you provide a general motivation statement for a real estate agent to stay focused and driven in their career?&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Client-Centric Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, create a motivation statement emphasizing the importance of client satisfaction in real estate.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Market Challenges Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, write a motivation statement for a real estate agent facing a challenging market, highlighting resilience and adaptability.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Goal-Oriented Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, draft a motivation statement for a real estate agent aiming to double their sales this year.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Innovation and Growth Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, I need a motivation statement for my website that inspires a real estate agent to embrace new technologies and growth opportunities in the industry.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Work-Life Balance Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, please write a motivation statement for real estate agents focusing on maintaining a healthy work-life balance.&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each prompt directs ChatGPT to generate a motivation statement tailored to different aspects of a real estate agent&#8217;s career, be it client relationships, market challenges, personal goals, embracing change, or balancing work and life.</p>\n<h3><strong>Experiment with Prompt Length</strong>:</h3>\n<p>Experiment with the length of your prompts. Different lengths can influence the model&#8217;s response, offering varied depth and breadth of information.</p>\n<h4>Example of Experimenting with Prompt Length</h4>\n<p>Using the same desire for a motivational statement as in the last example, a real estate agent can use prompts of different lengths to elicit varied responses from ChatGPT.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Short Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, give me a quick motivation boost for real estate sales.&#8221;<em>Result</em>: A concise, general motivational statement suitable for quick inspiration.</li>\n<li><strong>Medium-Length Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, I need a motivational statement about persisting in real estate during slow markets.&#8221;<em>Result</em>: A more focused motivational statement addressing the specific challenge of slow markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Long Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, as a real estate agent focusing on luxury properties in a competitive market, I often face high expectations and intense competition. Can you provide a detailed motivational statement that reminds me of the importance of personal branding and networking in maintaining a successful career in this niche?&#8221;<em>Result</em>: A detailed and nuanced motivational statement tailored to the challenges of selling luxury properties and the importance of personal branding and networking.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each prompt length allows for different levels of specificity and detail in the response, giving the agent flexibility in how they want to be motivated.</p>\n<h3><strong>Engage in Back-and-Forth</strong>:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4023 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6d18c3f045826969-Engage-in-Back-and-Forth.webp/public\" alt=\"AI Collaboration in Real Estate: Female Agent Engaging with ChatGPT Robot for Enhanced Client Communication\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Engage-in-Back-and-Forth.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Engage-in-Back-and-Forth-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>To obtain more detailed and comprehensive answers, engage in back-and-forth conversations with ChatGPT. This iterative dialogue of refining your prompts and instructions based on previous responses from ChatGPT allows you to fine-tune your queries and obtain better results over time.</p>\n<h4>Example of Back-and-Forth Dialogue</h4>\n<p>A real estate agent can engage in a back-and-forth dialogue with ChatGPT to develop a comprehensive script for asking a client to lower the price of their home. Here&#8217;s an example of how this dialogue might unfold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Agent&#8217;s Initial Request</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, I need to write a script to gently ask a client to consider lowering the price of their home. Can you start with a basic outline?&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>ChatGPT&#8217;s Response</strong>: ChatGPT provides a basic script outline focusing on key points like market trends, the importance of competitive pricing, and the benefits of attracting more buyers.</li>\n<li><strong>Agent&#8217;s Follow-Up</strong>: &#8220;That&#8217;s a good start, but can you include some empathetic language that acknowledges the client&#8217;s attachment to their home?&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>ChatGPT&#8217;s Revised Response</strong>: ChatGPT updates the script, adding empathetic statements and addressing the emotional aspects of selling a home.</li>\n<li><strong>Agent&#8217;s Further Request</strong>: &#8220;Can you now add a section explaining how a price reduction could lead to a faster sale, using recent market statistics?&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>ChatGPT&#8217;s Addition</strong>: ChatGPT adds a section with simplified market statistics and examples showing how competitive pricing can speed up the sale process.</li>\n<li><strong>Final Agent Request</strong>: &#8220;Great, now please conclude with a reassuring statement that highlights my commitment to getting the best possible outcome for them.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>ChatGPT&#8217;s Final Touch</strong>: ChatGPT concludes the script with a reassuring closing that emphasizes the agent&#8217;s dedication to the client&#8217;s interests and the successful sale of the property.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Through this iterative dialogue, the agent can refine the script to be comprehensive, empathetic, informative, and persuasive.</p>\n<h3><strong>Use Warm-Up Prompts</strong></h3>\n<p>Begin your conversation by providing warm-up prompts that help set expectations for both yourself and ChatGPT. This allows the model to understand what kind of information or assistance you are seeking.</p>\n<h4>Example of Using Warm-Up Prompts</h4>\n<p>Let’s see how real estate agents can use warm-up prompts to master ChatGPT to create a catchy flyer for an open house. Here&#8217;s an example of how to use these prompts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Initial Prompt</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, I&#8217;m planning an open house for a property in a residential neighborhood and need to create a flyer. Can we start with some ideas on how to make the flyer inviting and attention-grabbing?&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Building on the Response</strong>: After ChatGPT&#8217;s initial ideas, the agent can follow up with, &#8220;Great suggestions! Now, can you focus on emphasizing the unique features of the home, like the newly renovated kitchen and spacious backyard?&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Refining Details</strong>: &#8220;Based on your ideas, let&#8217;s add details about the open house event. Include the date, time, and a friendly message encouraging neighbors to visit. Maybe something like &#8216;Meet your potential new neighbors and explore this beautiful home!&#8217;&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Finalizing the Output</strong>: &#8220;Now that we have the content, can you format it into a brief but engaging flyer layout, suitable for printing and distribution in the neighborhood?&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Through this step-by-step process, the agent sets clear expectations and gradually builds up to a comprehensive and effective flyer design.</p>\n<h3><strong>Controlled Output</strong>:</h3>\n<p>If you want more control over the output, consider using system-level instructions such as &#8220;You are a helpful assistant&#8221; or &#8220;You are an expert in [specific topic].&#8221; These instructions can guide the behavior of ChatGPT in a particular direction.</p>\n<h4>Example of Using Controlled Outputs</h4>\n<p>A real estate agent wanting ChatGPT to provide 5 great YouTube ideas might say, “ChatGPT, you are an expert in knowing the best YouTube topics for a real estate agent. Can you provide me with 5 engaging and informative video topics that I should consider for my YouTube channel?</p>\n<p>That might return: 1. <strong>Home Buying Process Explained</strong>: Break down the steps of buying a home for first-time buyers 2. <strong>Virtual Property Tours</strong>: Showcase property listings with virtual tours. 3. <strong>Market Trends and Analysis</strong>: Discuss current real estate market trends and what they mean for buyers and sellers. 4. <strong>Home Staging Tips</strong>: Offer advice on how to stage homes for sale. 5. <strong>Neighborhood Guides</strong>: Highlight the best features of local neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>By using system-level instructions, the agent guides ChatGPT to focus on creating a list of YouTube topics specifically beneficial for real estate professionals.</p>\n<h3><strong>Breaking Down Complexities</strong>:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4022 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b37e056c416fb3e3-Breaking-Down-Complexities.webp/public\" alt=\"Real Estate Simplification - Man Using Chainsaw Symbolizing the Breakdown of Complex Tasks with ChatGPT\" width=\"424\" height=\"242\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Breaking-Down-Complexities.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Breaking-Down-Complexities-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" /></p>\n<p>If you have a complex question, consider breaking it down into smaller, simpler parts. This makes it easier for ChatGPT to understand and respond effectively.</p>\n<h4>Example of Breaking Down Complexities</h4>\n<p>A real estate agent may have a complex question like, &#8220;How do I increase my real estate sales in a competitive market, enhance my online presence, and improve client satisfaction?&#8221; This question can be broken down into smaller, simpler parts for more effective responses from ChatGPT:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Increasing Sales</strong>: &#8220;ChatGPT, what are effective strategies for increasing real estate sales in a competitive market?&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Enhancing Online Presence</strong>: &#8220;Based on the current digital marketing trends, what are the best methods for a real estate agent to enhance their online presence?&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Improving Client Satisfaction</strong>: &#8220;Can you provide tips on improving client satisfaction during the real estate buying and selling process?&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By dividing the complex question into these distinct parts, the agent can obtain more targeted and practical advice for each aspect of their query.</p>\n<h3><strong>Feedback Contribution</strong>:</h3>\n<p>Provide feedback on the model&#8217;s outputs. Your input helps to improve ChatGPT&#8217;s accuracy and effectiveness.</p>\n<h4>Example of a Feedback Contribution:</h4>\n<p>A real estate agent can enhance ChatGPT&#8217;s accuracy and effectiveness by providing specific feedback on its responses. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: ChatGPT generates a property description for a listing.</p>\n<p><strong>ChatGPT&#8217;s Response</strong>: &#8220;This charming 3-bedroom home features a spacious backyard and a modern kitchen.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Agent&#8217;s Feedback</strong>: &#8220;The description is good, but it needs to be more detailed for potential buyers. Can you include specific features such as the type of countertops in the kitchen, the size of the backyard in square feet, and any recent renovations? Also, please mention the proximity to local amenities like schools and parks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>By giving detailed feedback, the agent guides ChatGPT to produce more tailored and informative content, improving its utility for real estate purposes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beware-when-chatgpt-is-not-enough\">Beware &#8211; When Artificial Intelligence is NOT Enough</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4029\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6c20a6b1911972d1-Beware-When-Artificial-Intelligence-is-NOT-Enough.webp/public\" alt=\"Understanding AI Limits - Hands Framing AI Gears and Binary Code Indicating the Need for Human Oversight in Real Estate Tech\" width=\"1000\" height=\"487\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Beware-When-Artificial-Intelligence-is-NOT-Enough.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Beware-When-Artificial-Intelligence-is-NOT-Enough-300x146.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Beware-When-Artificial-Intelligence-is-NOT-Enough-768x374.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you’re getting a handle on how to talk to ChatGPT, you need to beware of its negatives. While ChatGPT has immense potential, it&#8217;s important to use it responsibly and ethically. Here are some considerations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Be Mindful of Biases</strong>: Like any language model trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, ChatGPT may exhibit biases present in that information. Be aware of this possibility and critically evaluate the responses for fairness and accuracy.</li>\n<li><strong>Verify Information Independently</strong>: While ChatGPT can provide helpful information, always verify critical facts independently from reliable sources before relying solely on its responses.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Misuse or Harmful Output</strong>: Use ChatGPT responsibly by refraining from harmful content creation or engaging in activities that violate OpenAI&#8217;s usage policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Respect Boundaries</strong>: Remember that ChatGPT is an AI language model and not a human being. Respect its limitations and boundaries when interacting with it, just as you would with any other technology tool.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"reflecting-on-your-journey-with-master-chatgpt\">Reflecting on Your Journey to Master ChatGPT</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4027\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5a85a537754b392a-Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT.webp/public\" alt=\"Real Estate Professional Reflecting on Mastering ChatGPT Techniques with Laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"408\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT-300x122.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT-768x313.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Congratulations on discovering how artificial intelligence and ChatGPT can revolutionize your business.

So start to master CHatGPT today!</p>\n<h3>Can I publish what ChatGPT generates as my own?</h3>\n<p>Under the guidelines provided by OpenAI, individuals are permitted to recreate what was produced in interactions with ChatGPT. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s crucial to recognize that distributing content derived from ChatGPT can lead to legal challenges, including potential breaches of copyright laws. Therefore, users should consider the outputs from ChatGPT primarily as creative inspiration rather than direct content for publication.</p>\n<h3>Can I use ChatGPT for customer support?</h3>\n<p>Absolutely! ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for providing customer support. With its ability to generate human-like responses, you can train it to handle common customer queries and provide accurate information in real-time, totally improving your productivity! Just make sure to monitor its responses closely and fine-tune it regularly to ensure it aligns with your brand&#8217;s tone of voice.</p>\n<h3>Is there a limit to the length of conversations I can have with ChatGPT?</h3>\n<p>While there is no strict limit on conversation length with ChatGPT, it&#8217;s important to note that very long conversations may lead to less coherent responses. To maintain clarity and coherence in the generated output, consider breaking down lengthy conversations into smaller chunks or using concise prompts.</p>\n<h3>Can I use ChatGPT as a content writer?</h3>\n<p>Certainly! ChatGPT can be an excellent tool for content creation. Whether you need help brainstorming ideas or generating drafts for articles or blog posts, it can assist you by providing creative suggestions or even complete paragraphs. However, always remember that human input and editing are crucial to ensure the final content meets your specific needs and aligns with your branding.</p>\n<h3>How can I address biases in ChatGPT&#8217;s responses?</h3>\n<p>While OpenAI has made efforts to mitigate biases in ChatGPT, it may still occasionally produce biased or inaccurate responses. To address this, you can provide explicit instructions to avoid certain types of bias or review and edit its outputs carefully. OpenAI also encourages users to provide feedback on problematic model outputs through their user interface.</p>\n<h3>Can I use ChatGPT for generating code or technical documentation?</h3>\n<p>Certainly! ChatGPT can be a valuable resource for generating code snippets or assisting with technical documentation. However, keep in mind that it is not a substitute for professional developers or technical writers. Always review and test the generated code or documentation thoroughly before implementing it in production environments.</p>\n<h3>Is there an API limit on the number of requests I can make to ChatGPT?</h3>\n<p>Yes, there are API limits based on your subscription plan. Free trial users have lower rate limits compared to pay-as-you-go users. You can find detailed information about rate limits and pricing on the OpenAI website. Make sure to manage your usage accordingly and consider upgrading if you require higher request volumes.</p>\n<h3>How often is ChatGPT updated?</h3>\n<p>OpenAI continually works on improving its models, including ChatGPT, by incorporating user feedback and conducting regular updates. As a result, you can expect ongoing enhancements and refinements over time. Stay tuned for announcements from OpenAI regarding new features and improvements as they continue to evolve their language models.</p>\n<h3>How Does OpenAi Improve the User Experience?</h3>\n<p><strong>Provide Feedback</strong>: OpenAI encourages users to provide feedback on problematic model outputs through the user interface. By providing feedback, you contribute to improving the system&#8217;s performance and addressing any limitations or biases that may arise.</p>\n<h3>Will Google search punish me by ranking me lower if I use ChatGPT to write my content?</h3>\n<p>The answer appears to be unknown at this time. Google states in its SEO policies that the content’s value is most important. However, others claim that Google does punish ChatGPT output. If you want to protect yourself from that problem, consider using one of the many AI detection sites to check whether Google is likely to recognize your content as AI-written.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Are you a <strong>brand new agent</strong> looking for the <strong>best brokerage</strong> to join? As a UC Berkeley Law School graduate and past California lawyer, I suspected the decision regarding which brokerage a new agent should join would be huge. It is!</p>\n<p>After all, the National Association of Realtors reported that 75% of Realtors fail within the first year, and 87% fail within <a href=\"https://sgrowcrm.com/reasons-agents-fail-and-how-to-beat-the-odds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">five years</a>. Researching brokerage options is worth a brand-new agent’s time.</p>\n<p>I <strong>researched several brokerages</strong>. I researched eXp Realty because it’s the fastest-growing brokerage in U.S. history and on the planet. It’s also now a part of the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EXPI?p=EXPI&#038;.tsrc=fin-srch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">S&#038;P 600</a>. I also researched other traditional brokerages &#8211; Compass, Vanguard, Sotheby’s, Coldwell Banker, and Remax &#8211; because of their local presence.</p>\n<p>In this article, <strong>I’ll share everything</strong> I learned from my research and interviews, plus, I’ll share everything I’ve learned since I joined eXp Realty, the <strong>pros</strong> of being at eXp and the <strong>cons</strong> of the brokerage, particularly for new agents.</p>\n<p>While eXp is the right brokerage for many brokers, real estate teams, seasoned/experienced agents, and new agents, eXp Realty is not right for every agent. Fortunately, it is for me. By my second year at eXp, I did well over <strong>6 figures in gross commission</strong>. I LOVE my brokerage, my eXp sponsorship group, and community, and what I do.

Traditional brick-and-mortar brokerages don’t run as efficiently because of their high cost of maintaining local office space and many layers of franchise owners.</p>\n<p>eXp Realty is the only large brokerage that earned a net profit in 2022, a year of falling transactions in the real estate industry. eXp can afford to improve agent earnings while other brokerages <a href=\"https://esquirereb.com/compass-next-victim-real-estate-business-cycle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decrease what agents earn.</a> Also, eXp Realty has been on <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-eXp-Realty-EI_IE907965.11,21.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor’s best companies</a> to work at for the last 6 years.</p>\n<p>Let’s dive into the pros and cons of joining eXp Realty for new brand agents.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"795\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/bbb09d99c83dbf05-Capture-3.webp/public\" alt=\"Comparative financial chart highlighting eXp Realty&#039;s positive net income against other real estate companies&#039; losses in 2022 and Q1 &#039;23 EBITDA results.\" class=\"wp-image-3926 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Capture-3.webp 795w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Capture-3-283x300.webp 283w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Capture-3-768x813.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pros-of-joining-exp-realty-for-new-agents\">Pros of Joining eXp Realty for New Agents</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-100percent-commission-payout-possibility\">1. 100% Commission Payout Possibility</h3>\n<p>Traditional brokerages told me new agents get anywhere from a 70/30 payout split to a 60/40 payout split (actually 64/36 and 54/44 because they didn’t deduct their 6% fee.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"896\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_1.webp\" alt=\"Illustration of diverse agents celebrating growth and opportunity at eXp Realty, with a flourishing plant and rising financial charts.\" class=\"wp-image-3922 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_1.webp 896w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_1-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_1-768x439.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>eXp Realty’s payout split can be more than 100% of an agent’s commissions. All agents start with an 80/20 split (a real one, there’s no hidden 6% broker fee). One exception &#8211; brand new agents earn 60/40 for their first 3 transactions while they are in eXp’s mentorship program (more on the mentorship program below).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Once an agent pays eXp $16,000 from their earned commissions (about $2.65 million in gross sales at 3% commission), the agent is considered “capped” that year and then the agent earns 100% of their commissions for the rest of their calendar year.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-extensive-free-agent-training\">2. Extensive FREE Agent Training</h3>\n<p>New agents at traditional brokerages often rely on one broker in their office to answer all their questions. A broker told me that I should buy expensive ($2000 or more) training classes to “learn” how to get leads and clients and make a commission.</p>\n<p>eXp’s training extends well beyond the support offered by a single broker. eXp has 3 primary training opportunities: 1. On-boarding videos and webinars directed at helping new agents get leads, clients, and commission as fast as possible, 2. 60+ hours of live training classes available each week, and those same training classes are recorded and available on-demand if a new agent can’t make the live training. 3. Sponsorship groups incentivized to offer additional training classes to agents. These sponsorship groups run 7 tiers deep, creating a deep support system for new agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-low-agent-fees-and-costs\">3. Low Agent Fees and Costs</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Traditional brokerages have so many fees: a 6% fee paid from gross commission on each transaction; a fee of $2000+ for E&#038;O insurance due at the beginning of each year; $100s in monthly desk fees and/or franchise fees. Also, at most traditional brokerages, agents must purchase their website and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tool.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/484fd15d157b2547-Low-Costs.webp/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3947 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Low-Costs.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Low-Costs-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>eXp Realty has no desk fees, no franchise fees, and no royalty fees. New agents pay $149 their first month at eXp and then just $85 a month thereafter. Additionally, that low monthly fee includes a personalized IDX website, a top industry CRM with lead generation tools (one that other agents pay $6000 a year for), access to Regus Business Lounges (yep, eXp does have office space), ongoing live training, and much more.</p>\n<p>Also, at eXp E&#038;O insurance fees are much lower &#8211; $40 paid from each commission and it caps at $500 annually. Last, eXp agents pay $25 for broker review from each commission. Clearly, eXp fees are MUCH lower than traditional brokerage fees!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-superior-support-with-exp-world-and-mentors\">4. Superior Support with eXp World &#038; Mentors</h3>\n<p>To get new agent questions answered, traditional brokerages told me “go to your office broker to ask your questions”. Wow, agents have to rely on the knowledge and availability of just one person?</p>\n<p>eXp Realty has over 2000 salaried employees in eXp World (their cloud-based office) to help answer questions and solve problems. Some employees are available 24-7.</p>\n<p>Additionally, eXp Realty has a mentorship program for brand-new agents. New agents are assigned a mentor who has been qualified by eXp. These mentors are invaluable in a new agent’s day-to-day needs and guidance through transactions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-seven-tier-sponsorship-groups-can-provide-top-value\">5. Seven-Tier Sponsorship Groups Can Provide Top Value</h3>\n<p>eXp Realty&#8217;s has unique 7-tier sponsorship groups that set it apart from other real estate brokerages. These groups offer agents incredible advantages in 2 ways.</p>\n<p>First, agents earn revenue income by sponsoring other agents into the company, something all agents do at any brokerage company, yet, at eXp, agents are compensated (from the company dollar). This <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-revenue-share/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"36\">revenue share</a> income is nothing to sneeze at. Top agents at eXp earn over 7 figures a month. That is not a typo! This <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-revenue-share-2024/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"3\">revenue share income</a> continues when an agent retires and it’s willable too.</p>\n<p>Second, because sponsorship groups only profit when agents earn commissions (sponsors are paid from the 20% eXp makes before an agent caps), sponsors are incentivized to help agents succeed both in their production and in bringing in new agents to the company.</p>\n<p>Great sponsorship groups offer training, support, and several weekly video calls that help agents earn more commissions and revenue share income. These calls also create community. Many agents say their virtual community is tighter than any physical brokerage office they’ve ever worked in.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-innovative-technology-and-virtual-tools\">6. Innovative Technology and Virtual Tools</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"896\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DA767B_1.webp\" alt=\"Real estate agents immersed in high-tech virtual reality environments, showcasing eXp Realty&#039;s innovative tools.\" class=\"wp-image-3920 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DA767B_1.webp 896w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DA767B_1-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DA767B_1-768x439.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>In today&#8217;s digital age, having access to innovative technology and virtual tools is essential for success in real estate. eXp Realty offers cutting-edge tools and training that are expanding all the time.</p>\n<p>Currently, eXp Realty has eXp World, IDX websites, Skyslope to easily complete transactions, a CRM that includes lead generation tools, a marketing center with customizable marketing materials, and so much more.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-access-to-huge-network-of-experienced-agents-across-different-markets\">7. Access to Huge Network of Experienced Agents Across Different Markets</h3>\n<p>eXp Realty’s huge network of over 88,000 agents offers invaluable opportunities for learning, collaboration, and referrals. That along with eXp’s culture of sharing allows new agents to connect with experienced agents to tap into their training expertise and gain valuable insights to navigate challenges and earn more commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8-work-from-anywhere-anytime-with-virtual-support-systems\">8. Work from Anywhere, Anytime with Virtual Support Systems</h3>\n<p>eXp Realty’s virtual work environment provides the flexibility to work from anywhere at any time. No eXp agent is confined by traditional office hours or geographic limitations. eXp Realty’s virtual support systems ensure agents have all the tools and resources needed for digital-age success.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9-brand-new-agents-can-be-more-efficient-with-new-tech-tools\">9. Brand New Agents Can Be More Efficient with New Tech tools</h3>\n<p>eXp has many advanced technology tools that other brokerages don’t have. Brand new agents are even more poised to take advantage of these tools than experienced agents who leave another brokerage and join eXp. That’s because experienced agents tend to keep doing what they were doing before they joined eXp and often they don’t learn to use the more efficient and effective tools that eXp offers. Brand new agents often make better use of Skyslope forms, kvCore CRM, kvCore Comparative Market Analysis, and so much more.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"10-affordable-healthcare\">10. Affordable Healthcare</h3>\n<p>Although healthcare is not free at eXp, most brokerages have no healthcare options. eXp Realty offers affordable healthcare options saving agents up to tens of thousands of dollars annually in healthcare costs.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"11-exp-luxury-launched\">11. eXp Luxury Launched</h3>\n<p>Sothebys, The Agency, and Compass no longer have the best marketing. eXp Luxury advertises luxury homes in the best of the best publications, translates listings into different languages, and offers global exposure for luxury listings. Plus, members of eXp Luxury get 4 monthly training calls offering top tips and training classes for our luxury agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"12-exp-centralized-a-referral-division\">12. eXp Centralized a Referral Division</h3>\n<p>With over 88,000+ agents all around the world, referrals are BIG business. eXp has made referrals easy with a centralized hub. A few clicks on a form and referral paperwork is all done. For agents choosing to only provide referrals to earn commissions, eXp has made it so those agents no longer have to pay their MLS and Realtor association fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"13-exp-commercial-real-estate-division\">13. eXp Commercial Real Estate Division</h3>\n<p>That’s right! Commercial agents get all the same great features and benefits that eXp offers. At eXp Realty, agents have lots of choices of how to earn an income.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"14-exp-has-extensive-vendor-partners\">14. eXp has Extensive Vendor Partners</h3>\n<p>While sponsors often use the term “partner with me”, <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-partners-rebranded-exp-solutions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vendor partners</a> refers to the vendors that eXp Realty has relationships with that bring services to eXp agents. The sheer size of eXp Realty with over 88,000 agents worldwide provides bargaining power for eXp to bring the best to agents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cons-of-joining-exp-realty-for-new-agents\">Cons of Joining eXp Realty for New Agents</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"?\">\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3923\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_2.webp\" alt=\"Agents navigating through a maze against a backdrop of skyscrapers, symbolizing the challenges faced by new agents at eXp Realty.\" width=\"896\" height=\"512\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_2.webp 896w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_2-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DALLE2_2-768x439.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\" /></figure>\n</h3>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-missed-opportunity-when-new-agent-chooses-the-wrong-sponsor\">1. Missed Opportunity When New Agent Chooses the “Wrong” Sponsor</h3>\n<p>Some agents join eXp Realty without naming a sponsor and others join sponsorship groups that don’t provide the value needed for that agent. It’s important for new agents to research the sponsorship groups so they won’t miss out on training, support, guidance, or resources that could have helped them thrive in their real estate careers.</p>\n<p>Note, that agents can not easily change sponsorship groups. To change groups, an agent must leave eXp for at least 6 months and then rejoin the company.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-revenue-share-challenges-for-new-agents\">2. Revenue Share Challenges for New Agents</h3>\n<p>Some agents become discouraged when trying to bring more agents into eXp and they may struggle to build income through attracting recruits. Joining a sponsorship group with revenue share training brings more success to agents seeking revenue share this income.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-lack-of-on-site-broker-guidance-may-be-hard-for-new-agents\">3. Lack of On-Site Broker Guidance May be Hard for New Agents</h3>\n<p>eXp Realty doesn’t maintain traditional brick-and-mortar offices. While the flexibility to work anytime from anywhere appeals to many agents, it may not suit everyone&#8217;s preferences or needs.</p>\n<p>Working remotely requires a high level of self-motivation and discipline, especially when it comes to training and doing the day-to-day activities necessary to succeed in the real estate business. While some agents thrive in this setting, others may struggle to stay focused and productive without the structure of a traditional office environment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-almost-too-much-support-and-training-for-new-agents\">4. Almost Too Much Support and Training for New Agents</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/84b29df4dbf26bfe-Frusturateed.webp/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3946 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Frusturateed.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Frusturateed-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Navigating the complexities of eXp Realty&#8217;s support, training classes, tools, and resources can be overwhelming. If a new agent joins eXp with a sponsor who doesn’t help an agent navigate it all, the agent may feel lost and unsure about what steps to take next in their training.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-lead-generation-new-agents-need-to-learn-how\">5. Lead Generation &#8211; New Agents Need to Learn How</h3>\n<p>eXp Realty is not going to hand agents leads. However, eXp will teach agents how to get them. “Give a man a fish and he eats for a day; teach him to fish and he eats for a lifetime.”</p>\n<p>eXp will help agents get leads. First, eXp has a relationship with OpCity (Realtor.com). New agents can get solid leads by just being the first one to claim a lead. Second, eXp has a program called “Make it Rain”, essentially a pay-for-click program completely done for agents to get leads. Additionally, eXp’s CRM creates the ability for agents to make landing pages and squeeze pages to find leads. Also, many sponsorship groups teach agents more ways to generate leads. Last, new agents learn how to generate leads in eXp’s Fast Start Training Series Program.</p>\n<p>Some traditional brokerages claim that leads will be given to new agents. It’s a common complaint that many brokerages don’t fulfill that promise or they do it with stale (bad) leads. Agents that join a brokerage only because they hand out leads, are not running their businesses. They are working for someone else.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tips-for-new-agents-to-succeed-at-exp-realty\">Tips for New Agents to Succeed at eXp Realty</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-research-and-choose-the-right-sponsorship-group\">1. Research &#038; Choose the Right Sponsorship Group</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s crucial to evaluate potential sponsorship groups. Each group has its own unique culture, support system, and resources that can greatly impact your success. Look for a group that aligns with your values and goals.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-embrace-additional-value-offered-by-exp\">2. Embrace Additional Value Offered by eXp</h3>\n<p>At eXp Realty, new agents can access additional value beyond traditional real estate brokerage services. Take full advantage. eXp University provides comprehensive training resources. Utilize it by checking the weekly course and attending the courses that suit your needs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if your sponsorship group offers mastermind video calls, attend the calls. These calls will get you “plugged in” for success while fostering relationships with other agents, and creating a supportive community.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-leverage-modern-marketing-strategies\">3.

Seek Guidance from Experienced Mentors</h3>\n<p>New agents at eXp are assigned a mentor for the agent’s first 3 transactions. Mentors offer advice and direction on lead generation, negotiation tactics, and market trends, as well as transactions. Actively engage with them, ask questions, and soak up their wisdom to enhance your chances of success.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-utilize-exp-world-for-support\">5. Utilize eXp World for Support</h3>\n<p>eXp World is an immersive virtual platform that allows agents to connect with colleagues worldwide and to get questions answered and problems solved.
