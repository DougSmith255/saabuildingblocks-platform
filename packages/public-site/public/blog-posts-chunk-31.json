And let’s face it, happy agents tend to be more successful agents.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a37cf1e2cc5b6038-Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about something that most agents overlook—brokerage profitability. Trust me, you care more about this than you think. A profitable brokerage is more stable and less likely to make decisions that negatively impact agents and clients.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with <strong>Sotheby’s</strong> International Realty. As part of Anywhere Real Estate, which includes brands like Coldwell Banker, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, and Century 21, they’ve posted 20 quarters of earnings with 12 profitable and 8 unprofitable quarters. So, they’ve had <strong>60% profitable quarters</strong>—better than some, but still room for improvement.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, <strong>eXp Realty</strong>’s track record is hard to beat. With 20 quarters of posted earnings, they’ve had 15 profitable quarters, giving them <strong>75% profitable</strong> quarters.  And, by the way, when you look at all the publicly traded brokerages over the past 5 years<strong>, eXp Realty is the only profitable one</strong>.</p>\n<p>This kind of financial stability translates into continued improvements for both agents and clients. It’s simple—when a brokerage is making money, they reinvest in their agents, offering better tools, training, and opportunities for growth. So, if you want a brokerage that’s both growing and financially stable, eXp has the upper hand here.</p>\n<p>What does that mean for agents? It means you’re at a brokerage that’s constantly improving and innovating, making things better for you and your clients. If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cf7f04b909c13ff1-Commission-Splits-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s get into one of the hottest topics for agents—commission splits. How much of your hard-earned commission will you actually take home, and how much is going to the brokerage? This can be a bit trickier to pin down at Sotheby’s since splits vary depending on the agent and location, just like many traditional brokerages.</p>\n<p>When I interviewed <strong>at Sotheby’s,</strong> despite having a strong resume—including being a former California attorney and having a large sphere of influence—they offered me a 70/30 split. Yep, 70% to me, and 30% to Sotheby’s. Our research shows that their splits range from <strong>70/30 up to 90/10,</strong> depending on the office and what deal you manage to negotiate.</p>\n<p>Now, here’s where <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out: it’s transparent, and the split is the same for everyone—no negotiations, no guessing. eXp agents start at an <strong>80/20</strong> split and move to <strong>100%</strong> once the 20% you’ve paid to eXp reaches $16,000 for the year. That’s called a cap.</p>\n<p>And if you hit certain milestones after capping, eXp will actually give you back that <strong>$16,000 in company stock</strong>. So, not only do you get to keep 100% of your commissions after capping, but you can also earn <strong>more than 100%</strong> through stock opportunities. Pretty sweet, right?</p>\n<p>Plus, with eXp, it doesn’t matter if you’re a brand-new agent or a top producer—everyone gets the same deal. There’s no behind-the-scenes haggling. You know exactly what you’re getting from day one. At Sotheby’s, capping may be available in some markets, but it varies widely, so you’ll need to check locally.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is a must-have for agents, as it protects both you and your brokerage from potential legal claims. But how you pay for E&#038;O insurance can make a big difference, and here’s where Sotheby’s and eXp Realty really diverge.</p>\n<p>When I was looking at <strong>Sotheby’s</strong>, they quoted me a hefty <strong>$2,200</strong> due upfront every year before I even closed a deal. That’s a big chunk of cash to shell out, especially if you’re just starting out or haven’t closed any transactions yet.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty,</strong> it’s a whole different ball game. Agents don’t pay for E&#038;O insurance until they actually close deals, which means you’re only paying once you’ve earned money. And even then, it’s <strong>just $60 per deal</strong>. The best part? eXp <strong>caps the E&#038;O fees at $750</strong> per year. So, after you’ve paid that $750, you’re done for the year—no more E&#038;O fees, no matter how many deals you close. That’s a solid $1,450 savings over Sotheby’s, and you only pay it if you’re making money. Definitely a much better deal for your wallet!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Fees</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about fees—because no one wants to see their hard-earned commission eaten up by surprise charges.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, there’s an easy-to-manage <strong>$85 monthly </strong>fee, and there’s a <strong>$25 transaction</strong> fee per deal until you hit your cap. Super straightforward.</p>\n<p><strong>Sotheby’s</strong>? It’s a bit more complex. While they don’t have a direct transaction fee, they do charge a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> on every transaction. Honestly, this feels just like a transaction fee because it comes straight out of your commission every time you close a deal.</p>\n<p>Plus, at most offices, there’s also around <strong>$150 &#8211; $190 monthly </strong>fee, so that’s nearly double what eXp agents pay just to keep the lights on.</p>\n<p>When you stack up the numbers, eXp’s simpler fee structure ends up being a lot more cost-effective, especially when you start closing more deals. Sotheby’s royalty fee can really add up over time and take a bigger bite out of your earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned pro or just starting out, having the right training and support can make all the difference in your career. And this is where <strong>eXp Realty</strong> really stands out. They’ve got over <strong>50 live training sessions</strong> every week, plus a whole <strong>library of on-demand courses</strong>. New agents can jump into a <strong>“Fast Start” program</strong> to start earning fast, while more experienced agents can level up with advanced training like the <strong>“Kick Start” program</strong>.</p>\n<p>On top of that, sponsors (like us at Smart Agent Alliance) add even more training and mentorship to the mix. And, if you ever run into a snag, eXp offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> with <strong>2,000 full-time staff</strong> members ready to help out. It’s hard to beat that level of accessibility and resources.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about <strong>Sotheby’s</strong>. Unfortunately, the experience there varies—<em>a lot</em>. When I interviewed at Sotheby’s, I was basically told to go buy my own $2,200 course for training. There was <strong>no training</strong> in place, so what you get in terms of training depends heavily on your local office broker.</p>\n<p>And what about agent support? There’s <strong>hit or miss support</strong> based on your office broker’s availability. That can leave you hanging if you need quick help before a client meeting or during a deal.  Not ideal.</p>\n<p>At eXp, you’ll never be left waiting for your broker to be free. Their support system is built for agents, with experts on call whenever you need them. It’s the kind of setup that allows agents to thrive with confidence, knowing that help is always available.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Sotheby&#8217;s: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to tech, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is a standout. They’ve taken the real estate world into the digital age with their fully virtual brokerage. Agents can access everything they need—training, support, collaboration, and even client meetings—in <strong>eXp World,</strong> their unique metaverse-style platform. No brick-and-mortar office is needed because eXp’s virtual setup is that effective. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Beyond that, eXp provides agents with a personal <strong>IDX website, a powerful CRM, a marketing center</strong> loaded with customizable templates, single property websites, social media content, <strong>and much more</strong>. And eXp is constantly improving, adding new tools and resources to keep agents ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p>Now, <strong>Sotheby’s</strong> isn’t exactly known for its cutting-edge tech. While it doesn’t have the fancy virtual platforms like eXp, it does offer <strong>global marketing</strong> for high-end home sellers through their established international presence.</p>\n<p>That’s great for agents working with luxury properties, but here’s the kicker—<strong>eXp Luxury</strong> offers the same level of <strong>global exposure</strong> for your listings at a fraction of the cost to the agent. That means eXp agents can market luxury properties worldwide while keeping more of their commissions in their pockets.</p>\n<p>So, if you’re tech-savvy or just appreciate having the best tools at your fingertips, eXp Realty is the clear winner. And even in the luxury space, eXp matches up with Sotheby’s global marketing power while being easier on your wallet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-sothebys-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Sotheby’s May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s be real—if you’re someone who thrives in a traditional office setting with that classic face-to-face interaction, then Sotheby’s might be the better fit.</p>\n<p>They’ve got physical offices where you can soak in that luxury vibe, and if you need the structure of an office broker pushing you to meet deadlines, Sotheby’s delivers. For agents who prefer having that in-person accountability, Sotheby’s could feel like home.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out of your home office space, eXp Realty does provide <strong>FREE access to the 4000 Regus office business lounges around the world</strong>.</p>\n<p>But that won’t be enough if you’re someone who likes being part of a more structured environment, where you need a local broker nearby for your daily motivation and productivity.  In that case, eXp Realty’s virtual freedom might not be for you.</p>\n<p>Not everyone thrives in a completely independent, online space. So, if you know you need someone to keep you on track, Sotheby’s is probably a better match for your style.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond all the usual perks, eXp Realty brings some truly standout features that most other brokerages just can’t match. If you work in the luxury market, eXp’s<strong> Luxury Division</strong> gives your high-end listings global exposure, putting them in front of the right audience worldwide.</p>\n<p>They’ve also got a team called <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose whole job is to find and deliver quality leads straight to eXp agents—pretty awesome, right?</p>\n<p>Their <strong>Referral tool</strong> makes sending referrals to other agents a breeze, and for those who want to focus solely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> helps cut costs while keeping you in the business.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, where you can earn extra income by simply recommending agents to join eXp. That income doesn’t just stop when you retire and it’s willable, meaning it keeps coming even after you’re gone. It’s a win all around!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Choosing between <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> and Sotheby’s comes down to what you value most as an agent. eXp offers transparency with an 80/20 commission split, low fees, 24/7 support, cutting-edge tech, and global marketing through eXp Luxury—all without the hefty royalty fees that Sotheby’s agents face.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Sotheby’s provides physical office spaces and global marketing, but with fewer training and support resources, and more costly fees. If you thrive in a traditional office and value in-person accountability, Sotheby’s may suit you. But if you prefer flexibility, higher commission potential, and modern tools, eXp Realty has the edge.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Your brokerage also affects your everyday work life, the support you receive, and the tools available to help you grow your business.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing <strong>eXp Realty</strong> and <strong>Keller Williams</strong> and we’ll look at everything from commission splits and fees to training opportunities, agent satisfaction, and more. And, by the way, all of <strong>eXp Realty’s</strong> information is transparent and easy to access online, but with <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, it’s not so easy and some details are hard to pin down. But we’ve done the research!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e998dad4c07b028a-Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s kick things off by seeing how happy agents are at each brokerage. Based on Glassdoor reviews, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds a stellar <strong>4.6-star</strong> rating, while <strong>Keller Williams</strong> is also highly rated at <strong>4.3 stars</strong>. These ratings reflect how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience at each company.</p>\n<p>And as we all know, happy agents tend to be more successful agents.

Simple—if a brokerage is financially stable, it’s more likely to keep investing in its agents by offering better tools, more training, and reliable support. A financially shaky brokerage might start making decisions that hurt agents, such as slashing commissions or adding new fees.</p>\n<p>Unlike eXp Realty, <strong>Keller Williams doesn’t have publicly traded stock, so their profitability is harder to gauge</strong>. Without that transparency, you’re left in the dark when it comes to understanding how well they’re really doing financially.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is completely transparent about its financials. eXp has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 of those quarters being profitable</strong>—a solid <strong>75% profitability rate</strong>.</p>\n<p>Even better, <strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been consistently profitable for the past five years.</strong> That kind of stability is crucial because it means continuous improvements for agents and clients without unexpected changes that hurt your bottom line.</p>\n<p>If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cf7f04b909c13ff1-Commission-Splits-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s dive into one of the most critical factors for any agent—<strong>commission splits</strong>.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, commission splits can vary quite a bit depending on the office, but they typically range from <strong>70/30, </strong>and once you’ve paid between <strong>$21,000 &#8211; $30,000</strong> depending on the location, you get to earn <strong>100% commission</strong> for the remainder of the year.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, every agent starts at an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong>. Plus, eXp offers stock awards for hitting certain milestones, and you can even earn your <strong>$16,000 cap back in company stock</strong> if you meet additional goals.</p>\n<p>The best part? eXp’s commission structure is the same for every agent in every location—no need to negotiate or wonder if someone else is getting a better deal. And with the potential to earn <strong>more than 100% of your commission</strong> through eXp’s stock opportunities, it’s a win-win.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>When it comes to Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance, how each brokerage handles this can make a big difference in your yearly expenses.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, E&#038;O insurance costs agents between <strong>$122 &#8211; $350 per month</strong> depending on the office, but it’s unclear whether this is paid upfront or on a per-deal basis.</p>\n<p>Over at <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, Agents only pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and there’s a yearly cap of <strong>$750</strong>. So once you’ve hit that cap, you don’t have to worry about paying for E&#038;O insurance for the rest of the year, no matter how many deals you close.</p>\n<p>This structure is especially beneficial for new agents who might not want to deal with hefty upfront costs before they’ve even started making money.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Fees</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about <strong>fees</strong> because hidden costs can really add up. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay a predictable <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and <strong>$25 per transaction</strong> until they hit their cap. No surprises, no excessive charges—just straightforward, manageable costs.</p>\n<p>Fees at <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, however, are more complicated. Monthly fees range from <strong>$122 to $350</strong>, depending on the office, and agents also pay a <strong>6% royalty fee per transaction</strong> until they cap. This means that in addition to the monthly fees, you’re also paying a percentage of every deal, which can eat into your earnings pretty quickly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Even experienced agents know that <strong>training</strong> and <strong>support</strong> can make all the difference in growing your business. So how do these two brokerages compare?</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training is outstanding. With <strong>over 50 live training sessions every week</strong>, a <span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">full<strong> on-demand</strong></span><strong> course library</strong>, and programs like <strong>Fast Start</strong> for new agents and <strong>Kick Start</strong> for experienced agents, you’re never short of opportunities to learn.</p>\n<p>Plus, <strong>eXp</strong> offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> through its virtual platform, eXp World, and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> are ready to assist when you need help.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, <strong>training and support vary by office</strong>. They do offer educational courses, but these come with a price tag, costing agents anywhere from <strong>$299 &#8211; $2,500 per course</strong>. <strong>Support</strong> is also <strong>dependent on the office</strong> you’re in, so while you may receive excellent help at some locations, other offices might leave you hanging.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Keller Williams: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to tech, eXp Realty is at the forefront with its fully virtual brokerage model. Agents can do everything online through eXp tech including <strong>eXp World</strong>, where agents meet with brokers, attend training sessions, and collaborate with other agents. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>eXp also offers each agent an <strong>IDX website</strong>, a <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> packed with customizable templates, social media content, and more. The tech at eXp Realty is constantly being updated, ensuring agents always have the best tools at their fingertips.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we couldn’t uncover much detailed information about the technology and resources provided at <strong>Keller Williams</strong>. While they likely offer tools for agents, there’s <strong>no clear standard</strong> across all offices, so your experience might vary based on where you work.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-keller-williams-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Keller Williams May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>If you’re an agent who prefers the <strong>traditional brokerage model</strong>, with the structure of physical offices and face-to-face interactions, then <strong>Keller Williams</strong> might be a better fit. They have a long-standing reputation and strong branding, and for some agents, having a local broker to guide and keep them in line is a key part of their success.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out-of-home office space, <strong>eXp Realty provides FREE access to the 4,000 Regus office business lounges around the world.</strong> But that won’t be enough if you thrive in a more structured environment, where your office broker helps push your productivity every day. If that’s the case, Keller Williams might feel more like home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t have. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry. And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp.</p>\n<p>The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>In the end, the choice between <strong>eXp Realty</strong> and <strong>Keller Williams</strong> comes down to your work style and what you value in a brokerage. <strong>Keller Williams</strong> offers a more traditional office environment with higher caps and additional fees, which might suit agents who like a more hands-on approach. On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> provides <strong>transparent splits, lower fees</strong>, cutting-edge tech, and <strong>24/7 support</strong>—making it the better choice for agents who value flexibility, innovation, and keeping more of their earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Sure, that’s critical, but your brokerage also shapes your daily life, how much support you get, and how many resources you can access to grow your career.</p>\n<p>Today, we’ll compare eXp Realty and RE/MAX—two well-known names in the real estate world. We’ll dig into their commission splits, fees, training opportunities, and, just as important, agent satisfaction.</p>\n<p>And, note that the information on eXp Realty is readily available, but with RE/MAX, not so much.  You either need to dig a little deeper to get the full picture. But don’t worry, we’ve done the work for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e998dad4c07b028a-Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs REMAX: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s start with how happy agents are at each brokerage. According to Glassdoor, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds an impressive <strong>4.6 star rating</strong>, while RE/MAX isn’t far behind with it <strong>4.2 star rating</strong>. These ratings tell you a lot about how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience at each company.</p>\n<p>And, as we all know, happy agents are usually more successful agents.

Because a financially stable brokerage means better resources, better tools, and fewer surprise changes that might hurt your wallet. Let’s take a look at how these two brokerages compare when it comes to financial stability.</p>\n<p><strong>RE/MAX</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>14 profitable quarters</strong>—so they’re sitting at <strong>70% profitability</strong>. However, when you dig into the numbers, RE/MAX tends to have <strong>huge losing quarters and smaller profitable ones</strong>, so while they’ve been profitable, the overall picture isn’t as rosy as it looks.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, eXp Realty has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>, which puts them at <strong>75% profitability</strong>. More importantly<strong>, </strong>eXp doesn’t have those huge losses like RE/MAX and, in fact,<strong> eXp is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years.</strong></p>\n<p>That financial stability translates to continuous improvements for both agents and clients, without cutting corners or slashing pay.

Let’s see how much of your hard-earned money you get to keep at each brokerage.</p>\n<p>At <strong>RE/MAX</strong>, splits range from <strong>60/40 to 95/5</strong>, and they offer two agent plans to choose from each with different fees attached.  Again, the specifics vary between agents and offices.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the splits are much simpler. Every agent starts at an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once the 20% you’ve paid to eXp hits <strong>$16,000 for the year</strong>, you move to <strong>100% commission </strong>for the remainder of the year. Plus, eXp rewards agents with <strong>stock</strong> for hitting certain milestones, and you can even get your <strong>$16,000 cap back in stock</strong> if you meet additional goals.</p>\n<p>So all eXp agents have the opportunity to earn <strong>more than 100% commission</strong> each year. And remember, eXp’s commission structure is the same for <strong>every agent, in every location</strong>—no haggling, no special deals.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs REMAX: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>When it comes to Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance, eXp Realty and RE/MAX approach things differently.</p>\n<p>At <strong>RE/MAX,</strong> I found that agents are charged <strong>$400 a year</strong> for E&#038;O insurance, admittedly that is curiously low so we’re not sure it’s correct.  We also don’t know when this is due. It’s probably upfront though, considering how low the cost is.</p>\n<p>Over at eXp Realty, agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but only when they close a deal. Plus, eXp caps your total E&#038;O insurance at <strong>$750 per year</strong>, which means no more payments after you hit that cap.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs REMAX: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really add up, and they vary greatly between these two brokerages. At eXp Realty, agents pay a <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and <strong>$25 per transaction</strong> until they cap. Super predictable.</p>\n<p>But at <strong>RE/MAX</strong>, the fees are all over the place. Agents can pay anywhere from <strong>$300 &#8211; $2500 a month</strong> depending on the office they’re working out of. And under one of their plans, there’s even a <strong>$499 per transaction fee</strong>. Ouch!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs REMAX: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about training and support—because even seasoned agents need guidance and resources to stay at the top of their game.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the support is phenomenal. You get access to over <strong>50 live training sessions per week</strong>, an entire <strong>on-demand library of courses</strong>, a <strong>“Fast Start” program</strong> designed to get new agents earning, and a <strong>“Kick Start” program</strong> for experienced agents. And, if you ever need help, eXp offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> and they have over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> ready to assist you.</p>\n<p>With <strong>RE/MAX</strong>, it’s a bit more hit-or-miss. They offer training through their <strong>online academy</strong>, but the level of <strong>support varies by office</strong>. Most support depends on how available the local office broker is. So, if you need help late at night or early in the morning, you might be on your own until the office opens.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs REMAX: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Both RE/MAX and eXp Realty are pretty tech-savvy, but eXp takes things to the next level.</p>\n<p>eXp Realty is a virtual brokerage—no physical offices are required because everything is done online. You get access to <strong>eXp World</strong>, a metaverse-style platform where you can meet with your broker, get tech support, and attend training. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp offers agents their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a robust<strong> CRM (kvCORE),</strong> a <strong>marketing center</strong>, and a <strong>steady stream of new tools</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>RE/MAX</strong> offers some similar tech, including the <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong> and a <strong>pre-made marketing</strong> package that includes flyers, postcards, and social media posts for your listings. But that’s about where the similarities end. While RE/MAX’s tools are solid, eXp Realty’s tech suite is constantly expanding, and their fully virtual platform sets them apart.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-remax-may-be-best-for-you\">Why REMAX May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>If you’re someone who prefers the traditional brokerage model with physical office spaces and enjoys the camaraderie of working in a local office, RE/MAX might be the better fit for you.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re just looking for out of your home office space, eXp Realty does provide <strong>FREE access to the 4000 Regus office business lounges around the world</strong>. But that won’t be enough if you’re someone who likes being in a more structured environment, where your office broker checks on your daily productivity.  In that case, eXp Realty’s virtual freedom might not be for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t have. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry. And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp.</p>\n<p>The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>So, when it comes down to <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> vs REMAX, it’s a close race, but eXp Realty comes out ahead with its <strong>transparent commission splits</strong>, <strong>lower fees</strong>, and <strong>better support and technology</strong>. RE/MAX has a solid reputation and office presence, which might be ideal for agents who prefer the traditional model, but overall, <strong>eXp Realty offers more value for most agents</strong>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Oh, and don’t skip over the part where we get into how financially strong these brokerages are, because trust us, that plays a big role in your future.</p>\n<p>One quick heads-up: <strong>eXp Realty is super transparent</strong> about their numbers, and you can verify everything online. <strong>Compass</strong>, on the other hand (like most traditional franchise models), <strong>isn’t as upfront</strong>.</p>\n<p>Their commission splits vary by agent and office, so you’ll need to interview with your local Compass team to get the full details. But no worries, I’ve got the inside scoop from my own experience interviewing with Compass, from talking to current Compass agents, and some good old-fashioned research.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e998dad4c07b028a-Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" />eXp Realty vs Compass: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>Let’s kick things off with a little reality check: how happy are agents at these brokerages? You don’t have to take my word for it—just look at the numbers. On <strong>Glassdoor</strong>, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> consistently shines with a solid <strong>4.6 stars</strong> from over 3,500 reviews. <strong>Compass</strong>, meanwhile, trails behind with <strong>3.7 stars</strong> from around 2,400 reviews.</p>\n<p>We’ve done the legwork comparing all the big real estate firms, and if you’re curious to go deeper, check out our blog, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em></a>. Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a37cf1e2cc5b6038-Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Compass: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>You might be thinking, “Who cares if my brokerage is profitable?” Well, you should—because when brokerages start losing money, it’s the <strong>agents who pay the price</strong> (literally). Here’s a juicy story about Compass and how their profitability struggles have impacted agents.</p>\n<p>A couple of years back, Compass was on a mission to grow fast, offering agents some sweet deals to join. But here’s the catch: those deals came with contracts that made it super hard to leave. Agents were basically stuck unless they wanted to cough up some serious cash to pay Compass back. Ouch.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to when Compass started realizing they weren’t profitable—so, what did they do? They cut agent pay! Yeah, that didn’t sit well with a lot of people. When a brokerage is bleeding money, changes like that hit agents and their clients the hardest.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, both Compass and eXp Realty are publicly traded, so it’s easy to see how they stack up financially. <strong>Compass</strong> has <strong>18 quarters of reported earnings</strong>, with <strong>zero profitable quarters</strong>—yep, you heard that right. They’ve been losing money every single quarter.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong>, on the other hand, has <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong> with 5 quarters of losses, giving them a <strong>75% profitability rate</strong>. In fact, <strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the last five years</strong>.</p>\n<p>What does that mean for agents? It means you’re at a brokerage that’s constantly improving and innovating, making things better for you and your clients. If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cf7f04b909c13ff1-Commission-Splits-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Compass: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>Ok, let’s get into what most agents are really focused on—commission splits. It’s what determines how much of your hard-earned commission you take home and how much your brokerage keeps. Now, Compass makes this a bit of a guessing game because splits vary by agent and location.</p>\n<p>When I first interviewed at Compass as a brand-new agent, I showed up with a pretty solid resume—former California attorney, President of a private school board, and a large sphere of influence. How much did they offer me? <strong>70/30</strong>. That’s 70% for me, 30% for Compass. Not bad, but not great either. From what I’ve seen, Compass splits can range from <strong>60/40 to 95/5</strong>, depending on the office and the deal you negotiate.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, which plays a completely different game from the traditional brokerages like Compass. One of the things I loved right away is that <strong>eXp Realty’s commission splits are totally transparent</strong>—no secret deals, no backroom negotiations. What you see is what you get, and it’s the same for everyone.</p>\n<p>You start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once the 20% you’ve paid to eXp hits <strong>$16,000 &#8211; the “cap”),</strong> you keep 100% of your commissions. But wait, it gets better! Once you cap, if you hit certain milestones, eXp Realty will give you back your<strong> $16,000 cap in company stock</strong>.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp rewards you with <strong>free stock</strong> for hitting various achievements, meaning agents can earn <strong>more than 100%</strong> of their commissions each year. Sweet deal, right?</p>\n<p>Oh, and there’s no need to haggle over your split at eXp—it’s the <strong>same for every agent</strong> whether you’re new or a seasoned superstar. How refreshing is that in this industry?! Now, I should mention that in some markets, Compass might offer agents a cap, but it can vary wildly, from no cap to <strong>double eXp’s</strong>. So, definitely check your local Compass office to see what they offer.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5ebdeab15a9a7866-EO-Insurance-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Compass: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about E&#038;O insurance—that’s errors and omissions insurance, and it’s a must-have for protecting both you and your brokerage from potential lawsuits. The difference between Compass and eXp Realty when it comes to E&#038;O is like night and day.</p>\n<p>At Compass, I was quoted <strong>$2,000 upfront</strong> every year—ouch! You’re paying that right out of the gate, <strong>before you even close a single deal</strong>. Not exactly ideal for new agents trying to keep costs down.</p>\n<p>Over at <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, things are way more agent-friendly. You don’t pay for <strong>E&#038;O</strong> until you actually close a deal, which means you’re <strong>earning the money</strong> to cover it as you go. And it’s only <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>. Even better, eXp caps your E&#038;O insurance at <strong>$750 per year</strong>. That’s <strong>$1,250 saved</strong> compared to Compass, and you only pay if you’re making deals. Now, that’s the kind of setup I like!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9ac44322cfa82eff-Fees-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Compass: Fees</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s talk fees—because nobody wants to be surprised by extra costs. Both Compass and eXp Realty are known for providing top-notch tech, but what’s that really going to cost you?</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, you’ve got a straightforward <strong>$85 per month</strong> fee, plus <strong>$25 per transaction</strong>. Simple, right? Compare that to <strong>Compass</strong>, where the monthly fee generally start around <strong>$145</strong> and can go up depending on the office you’re in. And it doesn’t stop there—Compass also hits agents with a <strong>4% marketing fee</strong> on each transaction. Ouch!</p>\n<p>Do the math, and it’s clear: agents who are doing deals regularly will end up paying way more at Compass than at eXp. That $25 per deal at eXp is a drop in the bucket compared to that 4% Compass is taking out of your commission. If you’re looking to keep more of your hard-earned cash, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is the much more cost-effective choice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6e604eb5fa2396b7-Training-and-Support-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Compass: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re new to the game or a seasoned pro, having solid training and support is crucial. eXp Realty really nails it here, offering more than 50 live training sessions every week, plus a massive library of on-demand content.</p>\n<p>They have a program designed to help experienced agents take their careers to the next level, and a quick-start program for new agents to help them start earning fast.</p>\n<p>On top of that, sponsors like us at Smart Agent Alliance add even more training and support on top of what eXp already offers. Oh, and did I mention eXp’s 24/7 support? Yep, no matter when you need help, day or night, eXp World’s expert care team is there to assist. No waiting until the next business day!</p>\n<p>Compass does offer training through their Compass Academy, but here’s where they fall short—they lack that around-the-clock support. So, if you hit a roadblock at 10 p.m. or need advice before an early morning client meeting, eXp has your back, while Compass might leave you hanging until business hours.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5d1d8f2ca2abb0cf-Technology-and-Resources-1.webp/public\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Compass: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Both Compass and eXp Realty love to claim their tech is top tier, but eXp Realty really takes things to a new level. With eXp, you get the ultimate virtual brokerage experience—no need for brick-and-mortar offices.</p>\n<p>Instead, eXp agents log into our own unique metaverse, &#8220;eXp World,&#8221; where we can meet with brokers, get tech support, chat with colleagues, create virtual offices for client meetings, and so much more. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Beyond eXp World, agents are set up with their own IDX website, a powerful CRM (customer relationship manager), a marketing center with tons of customizable templates, single property websites, and social media content.</p>\n<p>Honestly, eXp keeps rolling out more and more tech, so the tools just keep getting better. If you&#8217;re serious about leveraging cutting-edge technology in your business, eXp Realty’s got your back.</p>\n<p>Now, Compass isn’t without its own tech perks—they’ve got a solid national IDX website, some customizable marketing tools, and a CRM as well. But when it comes to pushing the boundaries of what tech can do for you, eXp takes the cake.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-compass-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Compass May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>The biggest distinction between Compass and eXp Realty comes down to how they operate. Compass sticks to the traditional brokerage model with physical office spaces.</p>\n<p>While eXp gives agents access to over <strong>4,000 Regus business lounges worldwide – for FREE</strong>, if you&#8217;re someone who really thrives in a classic office setting with an office broker there to keep you on track, then Compass might be the better fit. If you’re not naturally self-motivated, you may struggle with the freedom that comes with eXp’s virtual model.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, if you aren’t doing deals, it won’t matter that eXp’s structure could put more money in your pocket—you’ve got to hustle to make it work. So, if you need that extra push and love the idea of a physical office environment, Compass may be calling your name.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond all the usual perks, eXp Realty brings some truly standout features that most other brokerages just can’t match. If you work in the luxury market, eXp’s<strong> Luxury Division</strong> gives your high-end listings global exposure, putting them in front of the right audience worldwide.</p>\n<p>They’ve also got a team called <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose whole job is to find and deliver quality leads straight to eXp agents—pretty awesome, right?</p>\n<p>Their <strong>Referral tool</strong> makes sending referrals to other agents a breeze, and for those who want to focus solely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> helps cut costs while keeping you in the business.</p>\n<p>And let’s not forget <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, where you can earn extra income by simply recommending agents to join eXp. That income doesn’t just stop when you retire and it’s willable, meaning it keeps coming even after you’re gone. It’s a win all around!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Choosing between Compass and <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a>? Here&#8217;s the scoop: eXp offers better commission splits (80/20, 100% after capping), lower fees, and more income streams, plus cutting-edge virtual tools, 24/7 support, and tons of training. Compass, while solid, sticks to the traditional office model, with higher fees and no extra income options.</p>\n<p>If you’re self-motivated and tech-savvy, eXp is the clear winner. But if you need an office environment and a whip-cracker to keep you moving, Compass might be your jam. Bottom line: eXp gives you more bang for your buck—unless you prefer a physical office space.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Join our team with eXp Realty – the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span> </span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span> </span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span> </span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

A “This or That” real estate post is a simple, engaging way to connect with your audience. Imagine asking a fun, relatable question like, “Which do you prefer?” followed by “Jacuzzi or Pool?” These posts feature eye-catching images to make the choices clear and appealing.</p>\n<p>Agents typically post these questions to their social media stories, where viewers can quickly tap to vote, and to their static social media posts, where the comment section becomes a lively debate. Whether it’s a story poll or a static post, these questions are designed to spark engagement and get your followers talking.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"this-or-that-post-benefits\">“This or That” Post Benefits</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-comments\">More Comments</h3>\n<p>Interactive posts get more comments and shares. &#8220;This or That&#8221; real estate posts are perfect for this because they invite your followers to participate actively. Studies show that interactive content like these posts can generate up to 59% more engagement than static posts. More engagement means your posts are seen by more people, and that’s always a win!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"people-love-them\">People Love Them</h3>\n<p>Who doesn’t love to voice their opinion? Polls and quizzes are a hit online because they’re fun and easy to join. &#8220;This or That&#8221; real estate posts present choices side by side, making it easy for people to decide and share their preferences. This not only gives people a chance to be heard but also breaks down complex topics into simple, bite-sized comparisons.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"community-building\">Community Building</h3>\n<p>When people share their choices, they feel part of a community. They get to see what others prefer and why, turning the comment section into a lively discussion. This exchange of views adds depth to the conversation and makes the topic more engaging and personal. It’s a great way to create a sense of community and involvement among your followers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-traffic\">More Traffic</h3>\n<p>More interaction means more visibility for your social media posts. The more people comment and share, the more your content spreads across social media. This increased reach can drive more traffic to your profile and listings, helping you connect with more prospects in your real estate market.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"great-information\">Great Information</h3>\n<p>&#8220;These posts aren’t just for fun—they’re also a valuable source of information. By sparking conversations, agents can learn about client preferences and desires. This insight helps you tailor your services to better meet client needs, leading to stronger relationships and more successful transactions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-power-of-two-choices\">The Power of Two Choices</h3>\n<p>One reason “This or That” posts work so well is that they leverage the psychology of choice. The psychology of choice suggests that when people have too many options, they become overwhelmed and less likely to make a decision. By presenting just two choices, these posts simplify the decision-making process and encourage followers to share their opinions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"creating-effective-this-or-that-real-estate-posts\">Creating Effective “This or That” Real Estate Posts</h2>\n<p>Ready to create your own engaging “This or That” posts? Here are the key elements:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"understanding-your-audience\">Understanding Your Audience</h3>\n<p>Knowing your audience is crucial. They have specific needs and preferences, so tailor your posts to resonate with them. For instance, if your audience consists of young professionals, focus on modern design elements. The more you understand what your audience loves, the better you can engage them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"keeping-the-posts-visually-appealing\">Keeping the Posts Visually Appealing</h3>\n<p>People love looking at beautiful photos, and high-quality posts are more likely to stand out. Use high-quality images and vibrant colors to make your posts eye-catching. Tools like <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva</a> can help you create professional and visually appealing graphics with ease. Remember, a visually stunning post is more likely to grab attention and encourage engagement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"asking-relevant-and-timely-questions\">Asking Relevant and Timely Questions</h3>\n<p>Align your posts with current trends or seasons to keep them relevant. For example, during summer, you could ask, “Beach view or Mountain view?” This not only makes the question timely but also maximizes engagement by tapping into seasonal preferences. Relevant and timely questions are more likely to spark interest and conversation among your followers.</p>\n<p>By focusing on these elements, you&#8217;ll create “This or That” posts that are not only engaging but also highly effective in connecting with your audience</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"download-real-estate-this-or-that-posts-for-free\">Download Real Estate This or That Posts For Free</h2>\n<p>You can find the download options at the bottom of the page or in the sidebar.

Each has its own strengths, so let’s break it down.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"posts\">Posts</h4>\n<p>Posts are static and remain on your account, providing long-term visibility. Viewers can interact by answering the question in a comment, which can spark ongoing discussions. Posts are great because they can be seen by anyone, not just your followers, which helps broaden your reach.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"stories\">Stories</h4>\n<p>Stories, on the other hand, offer a more dynamic experience. Users can tap their screen to answer questions, making stories more interactive. However, stories disappear after 24 hours and are only seen by your followers, so they don’t have the lasting visibility of posts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"maximizing-your-social-media-reach\">Maximizing Your Social Media Reach</h2>\n<p>For maximum impact, start with a Instagram or Facebook post. It’s a quick way to engage your followers and get immediate responses. Then, a few days later, share the post to your story. This strategy gives you the best of both worlds. You get the lasting visibility of a post and, sometime later, the poll interaction of a story that may be an audience that missed your original post.</p>\n<p>By using both posts and stories, you can maximize your reach and ensure your content gets seen by a broader audience.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-post-an-interactive-this-or-that-real-estate-post\">How to Post an Interactive “This or That” Real Estate Post</h2>\n<p>Ready to get your “This or That” posts up and running?

This or That real estate posts are perfect for this because they invite your followers to participate actively. Studies show that interactive content like these posts can generate up to 59% more engagement than static posts. More engagement means your posts are seen by more people, and that’s always a win!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">How can I make my “This or That” real estate post effective?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Here are the key elements: 1.

    "content": "<p>Navigating the <strong>new rules</strong> of real estate can feel like a fresh start rather than a hurdle. When the NAR rules kick in on <strong>August 17, 2024</strong>, transparency becomes the name of the game. Buyers will now sign contracts that clearly outline their agent&#8217;s fees &#8211; <strong>no more hidden costs</strong> rolled into the MLS listings.</p>\n<p>This means, as a buyer agent, it&#8217;s <strong>critical to communicate</strong> these changes, <strong>justify your value</strong>, and <strong>explain the buyer agent contract</strong>. But, no worries! You’ll handle it all during your buyer agent presentation and appointment with your prospective client.</p>\n<p>Hey, this isn&#8217;t really new territory. Listing agents have always had to justify their value and secure contracts. Now, buyer agents must <strong>step up</strong> and do the same.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re an experienced agent or a newbie, we’ve got your back with this comprehensive look at buyer agent presentations. <strong>You&#8217;ve got this!</strong> Here’s your handy dandy index:</p>\n<ul class=\"pm-toc\">\n<li><a href=\"#new-nar-rule-explained\">New NAR Rule Explained</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#winning-buyer-agent-presentations\">Winning Buyer Agent Presentations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#buyer-agent-appointment-prep\">Buyer Agent Appointment Prep</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#buyer-agent-appointment-show-time\">Buyer Agent Appointment &#8211; Show Time</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#post-buyer-agent-appointment\">Post Buyer Agent Appointment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#compensation-choices\">Compensation Choices</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#thats-a-wrap\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"new-nar-rule-explained\">New NAR Rule Explained</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-240658\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d7593e9edbaeb0df-New-NAR-Rule-Explained.webp/public\" alt=\"Hands holding a miniature house with the REALTOR® logo, illustrating a buyer agent explaining new NAR rules\" width=\"1000\" height=\"259\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/New-NAR-Rule-Explained.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/New-NAR-Rule-Explained-300x78.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/New-NAR-Rule-Explained-768x199.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>On August 17, 2024, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) is implementing its <strong>big change for buyer agents.</strong> From then on, before you can tour homes with clients, you&#8217;ll need a written agreement in place that clearly spells out your agency and fees. Yikes! That’s something most buyer agents haven’t done in a very long time.</p>\n<p>No worries, the task doesn’t have to be daunting! As a buyer agent, it’s merely time to fine-tune your approach. All you’ll need to do is be clear and upfront with clients. Think detailed buyer presentations that lay it all out before the house hunting even starts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"winning-buyer-agent-presentations\">Winning Buyer Agent Presentations</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to elevate your buyer agent presentation. Forget about those days when a few general bullet points were enough to win over new clients. Now, with clients needing to sign an agreement to pay you even if the home seller doesn’t, they’ll want <strong>detailed information</strong> about your services.</p>\n<p>Showcase the hard work you do behind the scenes. Educate your buyer clients on the value you bring and the effort you put in that often goes unnoticed. It&#8217;s your chance to highlight your expertise and dedication, ensuring they understand exactly what they’re getting when they choose you as their agent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buyer-agent-presentation-components\">Buyer Agent Presentation Components</h3>\n<p>In general, all buyer presentations will include you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introducing Yourself &#038; Your Unique Value Proposition</li>\n<li>Introducing Your Brokerage &#038; the Home Buying Process</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Besides doing those, in these changing times, also plan to add sections about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How Agents Get Paid</li>\n<li>Pledges and Requests</li>\n<li>Buyer Contracts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s look at how you can make each of these most compelling.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introduction-you\">Agent Introduction</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s kick things off by introducing yourself with a burst of enthusiasm! Start with something like: &#8220;Hi there, I&#8217;m Karrie Hill and I&#8217;m absolutely passionate about real estate!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Next, share a bit about your background to build a connection. For example, &#8220;I got into real estate after a rewarding career in law because I realized my true calling was helping people find their dream homes. There&#8217;s nothing like the happiness on a client&#8217;s face when they find &#8216;the one.&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Add a personal touch by mentioning your hobbies or community involvement. For instance, &#8220;When I&#8217;m not busy showing homes, you&#8217;ll find me hiking the beautiful Marin County trails with my two little dogs, Baxter and Lily, or volunteering at the local animal shelter. I love giving back to the community and connecting with nature.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These personal details make you relatable and showcase your dedication to both your clients and your community. It&#8217;s all about creating that warm, trustworthy first impression!</p>\n<h3 id=\"your-unique-value-proposition\">Your Unique Value Proposition</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-240660 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/2bdd5f238abc4f7f-Your-Unique-Value-Proposition.webp/public\" alt=\"A red figure of a buyer agent running ahead of white figures, symbolizing a unique value proposition in real estate.\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Your-Unique-Value-Proposition.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Your-Unique-Value-Proposition-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, let&#8217;s talk about what sets you apart from the competition. Your unique value proposition (UVP) is all about defining and showcasing what makes you the go-to agent for buyers. It&#8217;s about highlighting the specific benefits and services you offer that directly address your clients&#8217; needs and pain points.</p>\n<p>Start by clearly articulating what you do for your clients, how it benefits them, and why they should choose you over others. For example, you might highlight your extensive experience, deep market knowledge, legal &#038; construction background, savvy use of technology, or innovative approaches to finding the perfect home.</p>\n<p>Here are some key elements to include:</p>\n<h4 id=\"certifications\">Certifications</h4>\n<p>Highlight any professional certifications you hold. Like being a Certified Residential Specialist (CRS) or Accredited Buyer&#8217;s Representative (ABR). These certifications boost your credibility and reassure clients of your expertise. Don’t have any? No worries. Go to the National Association of Realtors and take some certified courses online.</p>\n<h4 id=\"experience\">Experience</h4>\n<p>Leverage your experience if you’ve been an agent for years or tap into your team’s or brokerage’s collective expertise if you’re newer. Mention specific achievements or milestones to show your credibility.</p>\n<p>For instance, say, &#8220;With over 10 years in the industry, I&#8217;ve helped hundreds of families find their dream homes.&#8221; Or highlight team success with, &#8220;Our team sold $3.5 billion in real estate last year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can also emphasize your brokerage&#8217;s reach like &#8220;eXp Realty helps more families buy and sell homes than any other independent brokerage.&#8221;</p>\n<h4 id=\"agent-metrics\">Agent Metrics</h4>\n<p>This is where you can really shine! Do the math and find impressive metrics to show your value. Use your team or brokerage stats if you don’t have personal numbers yet. Here are some key metrics to highlight:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Savings: &#8220;On average, I save my clients $5,000 through smart negotiations and concessions.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Efficiency: &#8220;Most of my clients find their home after touring just five properties.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Speed: &#8220;My average client finds a home and closes the deal within 45 days.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Success Rate: &#8220;I have an 85% offer acceptance rate, ensuring you get the home you want.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Brokerage or Team Success: &#8220;Our brokerage has a track record of selling homes 20% faster than the market average.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Testimonials</h4>\n<p>Include glowing testimonials from satisfied clients. For example, &#8220;John and Jane Doe said, &#8216;Working with Karrie Hill was a game-changer. She found us the perfect home and saved us thousands!&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n<p>Getting these fantastic testimonials is easier than you think. Ask for them when your clients are happiest, whether that’s after seeing homes, finding the perfect one, or getting into contract. Don’t wait until after closing, as clients are often busy with their move and less engaged. Make it simple for them by sending a link to leave a Google review. This way, you capture their positive feedback when it’s fresh and enthusiastic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introduction-your-brokerage\">Brokerage Introduction</h3>\n<p>Now that you’ve covered why clients should work with you, add a bit of brokerage magic to your presentation. Introduce your brokerage and explain why you chose to work with them. Highlight special tech, support, tools, or access to off-market properties that your brokerage brings to the table.</p>\n<p>For example, you might say, &#8220;I chose to work with eXp Realty because of their cutting-edge technology and unparalleled support. Our brokerage offers exclusive tools that help me find the best deals, including access to off-market properties that other agents can’t provide. Plus, our team is backed by a network of experienced professionals ready to assist 24/7 with every step of the home-buying process.&#8221;</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-home-buying-process\">The Home Buying Process</h3>\n<p>Alright, this is the meat of traditional buyer agent appointments. Typically, agents talk about steps to home buying, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set a Budget</li>\n<li>Search for Homes</li>\n<li>Tour Homes</li>\n<li>Make an Offer</li>\n<li>Negotiate and Contract</li>\n<li>Work During Escrow</li>\n<li>Closing Day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But let’s up your game! For each step, don’t miss the chance to explain what you do behind the scenes. Your clients don’t know all the work you put in, and now with contracts that clearly state your pay, you need to explain what you do to earn it.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-240659 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/c5493571e564c3b5-The-Home-Buying-Process.webp/public\" alt=\"A happy couple celebrating outside their new home with keys, assisted by a buyer agent.\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Home-Buying-Process.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Home-Buying-Process-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Reasonable people don’t mind paying for value when they understand it. So, expand each traditional step with a list of your behind-the-scenes work.</p>\n<p>Are you not sure what you do at each step? Write it down during your next transaction, or use guides like NAR’s “<a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/competition-in-real-estate/179-ways-agents-who-are-realtors-are-worth-every-penny\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">179 Ways Agents Who Are Realtors Are Worth Every Penny of Their Compensation</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/105-more-ways-2023-11-13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">105 More Ways</a>” to detail your efforts. Make sure to explain terms and what clients should expect at each stage.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget to highlight key steps that buyers care about most. For example, explain how you strategize and negotiate deals. Clients want agents who can get them the house they want at the best price.</p>\n<p>Show clients every step you take to make their home-buying experience seamless and valuable. They’ll appreciate the transparency and the effort you put into earning your commission.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-agents-get-paid\">How Agents Get Paid</h3>\n<p>Alright, now that your clients will be paying you directly, it&#8217;s super important they get the real scoop on how you&#8217;re compensated. You know, that big commission check? Most folks don&#8217;t realize it’s not all going into your pocket.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s clear that up before anyone jumps to the conclusion you&#8217;re taking home the whole pie. Transparency here will help your clients appreciate the hustle behind your service. They’ll understand why every dollar counts! Here’s a simple way to explain it:</p>\n<h4 id=\"contingency-based-income\">Contingency-Based Income</h4>\n<p>Think of agent pay like lawyers who work on contingency and only get paid when they win your case. Typically agents also only get paid if a deal closes. This means you work for free and no earnings are guaranteed. It’s all or nothing. It&#8217;s a high-risk, high-reward setup where your payoff compensates for the many hours you may invest without a return.</p>\n<h4 id=\"commission-split\">Commission Split</h4>\n<p>The commission you earn on closing a deal isn&#8217;t all yours to keep. A portion of it goes to your brokerage, referral partners, transaction coordinators, and sometimes others too. Your commission check is a team effort!</p>\n<h4 id=\"out-of-pocket-expenses\">Out-of-Pocket Expenses</h4>\n<p>Unlike a typical 9-to-5 job where the company picks up the tab for business expenses, as a real estate agent, you&#8217;re running your own show. You pay marketing costs, travel expenses, continuing education costs, real estate association dues, home access key fees, and much more! Your commission isn&#8217;t just profit. It also keeps your business afloat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buyer-agent-pledge\">Buyer Agent Pledge</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-240663 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/af9921f2012ff382-Buyer-Agent-Pledge.webp/public\" alt=\" A buyer agent with a hand over his heart, signifying a pledge to serve clients with integrity.\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Buyer-Agent-Pledge.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Buyer-Agent-Pledge-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s jazz up your buyer agent presentation with a splash of commitment and charm! Throw in a &#8220;Pledge to Please&#8221; where you lay out your golden promises—total honesty, crystal-clear transparency, and steadfast support from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to make your pledge stand out: Commit to honest property assessments, guarantee confidentiality, and always put your client&#8217;s interests first. Ensure your clients that you will communicate clearly and promptly, disclose any potential conflicts of interest, show all properties that fit your client&#8217;s needs, and thoroughly explain all documents before they sign.</p>\n<p>This pledge sets clear expectations and showcases your dedication to ethical practices and client satisfaction. It can strengthen your relationships with clients and help you stand out in a crowded market. Staying true to this pledge will build your reputation as a reliable and trustworthy agent, potentially earning you more referrals and repeat business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"requests-of-clients\">Requests of Clients</h3>\n<p>Want to keep those home tours smooth and professional? Giving your clients a heads-up on these tips makes the process more efficient and cements your reputation as a pro who’s all about respect and transparency. Share these tips with your clients:</p>\n<h4 id=\"punctuality-is-key\">Punctuality is Key</h4>\n<p>Arriving on time keeps the day running smoothly and shows respect for everyone’s busy schedules! Angering a seller by being late won’t help you win the home.</p>\n<h4 id=\"chatting-during-tours\">Chatting During Tours</h4>\n<p>Discussing offers or sensitive details in the house? Not a great idea. You never know if sellers or other buyers are listening in. Keeping negotiations under wraps until you&#8217;re in a private setting protects your strategy and maintains confidentiality.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buyer-contracts\">Buyer Contracts</h3>\n<p>Alright, let’s dive into the heart of the matter: those essential buyer contracts. From August 17th, thanks to the new N.A.R. rules, you&#8217;ll need to have a signed buyer agent agreement in place before you show any homes.</p>\n<p>But, it’s all good! Navigating contracts with clarity and flexibility demonstrates your professionalism and builds trust and loyalty with your clients. Here’s how you can handle it with flair:</p>\n<h4 id=\"introducing-the-contract\">Introducing the Contract</h4>\n<p>After rocking your buyer presentation, it’s time to chat about the nitty-gritty—signing that contract. This isn&#8217;t just paperwork; it’s the blueprint of your relationship with your client. It outlines both parties&#8217; responsibilities and details your compensation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"flexibility-is-key\">Flexibility is Key</h4>\n<p>Everyone loves options, right? Depending on how well you know your client, you could suggest different types of agreements. For a well-acquainted client, think about proposing an exclusive, long-term contract covering any property. For newer clients, maybe start with a non-exclusive, short-term agreement focused on specific areas. This flexibility helps put clients at ease, giving them control over how they commit.</p>\n<h4 id=\"cancellation-policy\">Cancellation Policy</h4>\n<p>Let’s talk about making exits as smooth as entries. It’s wise to clarify your cancellation policy upfront. Whether it’s a no-fuss immediate cancellation or a more standard 30-day notice, make sure they know their options. Being clear about cancellation terms prevents future headaches and preserves good vibes. This keeps the door open for referrals down the road.</p>\n<h4 id=\"clarify-the-fine-print\">Clarify the Fine Print</h4>\n<p>Be upfront about what cancellation means. For instance, if a client decides to back out, are they still on the hook for showings you’ve already done?

But remember, a stellar client meeting isn&#8217;t just about running through your presentation. It&#8217;s about engaging actively with your clients, weaving seamless conversations into your pitch to really connect.</p>\n<p>Here are some key strategies to keep the dialogue serving your interests:</p>\n<h3 id=\"client-centric-communication\">Client-Centric Communication</h3>\n<p>Focus on listening more than talking. Engage your clients with open-ended questions to better understand their thoughts and concerns. Adapt your responses and your presentation to meet their specific needs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understanding-your-client\">Understanding Your Client</h3>\n<p>Get to know what your clients are really looking for. Don&#8217;t just focus on the basic requirements like bedrooms or location; dive into their lifestyle needs, future plans, and personal preferences.</p>\n<p>Consider using a Google Form to gather the basic information before the meeting. Then you can focus on the deeper information at the appointment. This is your chance to understand beyond the surface details and into the life they envision in their new home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tailoring-the-conversation\">Tailoring the Conversation</h3>\n<p>Customize your discussion based on whether they are experienced homebuyers or first-timers. For seasoned buyers, streamline the process information; for newbies, explain each step carefully to build confidence.</p>\n<p>Also, tailor your chats to sync with your buyer&#8217;s vibes! Celebrate their milestones like buying their first home or moving cities, and pump it all up the enthusiasm. Tap into their emotions that buying a home involves &#8211; stress, excitement, fear, whatever. Show them you get it! Your empathy will ease their nerves and make their home-buying experience better.</p>\n<h3 id=\"incorporate-stories\">Incorporate Stories</h3>\n<p>Share anecdotes from past clients with similar backgrounds or needs. These stories help current buyers visualize their success and connect more deeply with the process. Emphasize the positive impacts and emotional satisfaction of previous clients.</p>\n<h2 id=\"post-buyer-agent-appointment\">Post Buyer Agent Appointment</h2>\n<p>You’ve successfully presented your buyer agent presentation, now what?</p>\n<h3 id=\"follow-up\">Follow Up</h3>\n<p>After the presentation, you’ll want to check in with potential clients. Ask if they have any questions. This shows them that you are committed. You can also send thank you notes or emails. It&#8217;s a nice gesture that can set you apart from others. don’t be afraid to ask them to sign the buyer agent agreement so you can start showing them homes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"all-interactions\">All Interactions</h3>\n<p>Once they become your client, always put your best foot forward. When interacting with them, review their client file to be up on their particular facts and needs. While out looking at homes also focus on educating your buyers, not pushing them to a purchase. Providing them with knowledge empowers buyers and makes them feel valued and respected, keeping the dynamic not a sales transaction but rather an advisory relationship.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compensation-choices\">Compensation Choices</h2>\n<p>With all the prior information, you are ready to rock your buyer agent role. However, let’s cover one more thing that might be nagging at you.</p>\n<p>That is, now the new N.A.R. rules say your compensation will no longer be a percentage of the sales price offered through the MLS. Without that constraint, buyer agents are likely to make more creative choices about their compensation.</p>\n<p>Let’s go over some of those. Of course, all the following ideas are subject to both the rules of your state and your brokerage. So, check on those.</p>\n<h3 id=\"percentage-based-commission\">Percentage-Based Commission</h3>\n<p>You already know this one. This traditional model involves charging a percentage of the home’s sale price, typically between 2.5% to 3% for the buyer’s agent. Let your buyers know that this is what you are paid when a deal closes.</p>\n<p>Stick with this percentage-based commission structure if you plan to provide a full suite of services listed in your buyer agent presentation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flat-fee-structure\">Flat Fee Structure</h3>\n<p>Ideal for high-value property markets, the flat fee model lets buyers sidestep the heftier percentage-based commissions. For a fixed amount &#8211; say, $9,999 &#8211; buyers can enjoy significant savings, especially on more expensive properties.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to clearly define which services you’ll provide in exchange for a flat fee.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pay-per-service\">Pay Per Service</h3>\n<p>This a la carte approach allows clients to pay only for the services they use, offering flexibility and potentially lowering costs. It’s crucial to outline what each service entails and ensure the pricing is transparent and fair.</p>\n<h3 id=\"non-refundable-retainer-fee\">Non-Refundable Retainer Fee</h3>\n<p>A non-refundable retainer fee can help agents sort out the real buyers from the unmotivated buyers by requiring that they have some skin in the game. This fee secures your services while ensuring you will be paid something for your time even if the client never closes a deal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-caveat\">The Caveat</h3>\n<p>Remember, under the new rules, you set the price ceiling on what you can earn.</p>\n<p>That means that even if a seller offers a buyer agent more than what you contracted for, you will not get more than your contract amount. This means that if a seller throws in a sweetener that exceeds your agreed-upon fee, you’re still capped at your contract rate &#8211; you can’t get more.</p>\n<p>However, you&#8217;ve still got the freedom to slide those numbers down whenever it suits the situation. Why might you drop your fee? Maybe you wrapped up a deal faster than a New York minute, or perhaps shaving off a few percentage points could rescue a nearly dead deal. Or, you might decide to match a lower offer from a seller just to keep things smooth.</p>\n<p>You may want to set your fee high and adjust as needed, giving you the flexibility to adapt to different scenarios. It’s all about making your commission work for you and your client, ensuring everyone walks away happy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Navigating the buyer agent appointment process just got easier.

From then on, before you can tour homes with clients, you&#8217;ll need a written agreement in place that clearly spells out your agency and fees. As a buyer agent, you’ll need to do is be clear and upfront with clients. Think detailed buyer presentations that lay it all out before the house hunting starts.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What should be included in a buyer agent presentation?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">In general, include some primary information like: Your Introduction Yourself, Your Unique Value Proposition, Your Brokerage Introduction, and The Home Buying Process. Due to the new N.A.R. rules also plan to add sections for: How Agents Get Paid, Pledges and Requests and Buyer Contracts.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What’s a unique value proposition?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">This is about defining and showcasing what makes you the go-to agent for buyers. It&#8217;s about highlighting the specific benefits and services you offer that directly address your clients&#8217; needs and pain points.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What should I include in my unique value proposition?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Start by clearly articulating what you do for your clients, how it benefits them, and why they should choose you over others. For example, you might highlight your extensive experience, deep market knowledge, legal u0026amp; construction background, savvy use of technology, or innovative approaches to finding the perfect home.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">How much do real estate agents keep from their commission?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Typically agents also only get paid if a deal closes. This means they work for free and no earnings are guaranteed. From commission earned, agents pay a portion to their brokerage and they also may pay referral partners, transaction coordinators, and others too. Plus, since unlike a typical 9-to-5 job, real estate agents pay all their own expenses like marketing costs, travel expenses, continuing education costs, real estate association dues, home access key fees, and much more!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">How can I improve my buyer agent presentation?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Jazz it up to ensure that it sticks with your clients. First, consider whipping up a dynamic PowerPoint or a snazzy Canva presentation. Using animations, vibrant photos and creative designs keeps your clients engaged. Second, make sure your clients walk away with printed key points or a pdf of entire presentation. This helps reinforce what they’ve learned and keeps you top of mind.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">In what ways can agents structure their pay?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">With the new N.A.R. rules, buyer agents are likely to make more creative choices about their compensation like the same percentage-based system or flat-fee structures, pay per service, or service with a non-refundable retainer fee. In any event, agents can’t earn more than their contract states even if a seller is offering more.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

While most agents naturally share their positive experiences about their brokerage, the difference at eXp Realty is that you get paid for it.</p>\n<p>The best part? Your revenue share income comes from <strong>eXp’s company dollar</strong>—not from the new agents you bring in. This means new agents don’t have to give up part of their commissions, and your support is completely free to them. It’s a win-win for everyone involved.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-an-e-xp-agent-becomes-an-e-xp-realty-sponsor\"><strong>How an eXp Agent Becomes an eXp Realty Sponsor</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/542936b716e286ba-Whats-Revenue-Share-at-eXp.webp/public\" alt=\"A woman holding a fan of hundred-dollar bills in front of her face, representing the financial benefits of the exp revenue share program.\" class=\"wp-image-240215\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whats-Revenue-Share-at-eXp.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whats-Revenue-Share-at-eXp-300x88.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whats-Revenue-Share-at-eXp-768x225.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Becoming a sponsor at eXp Realty is simple. If you’ve joined eXp and another agent expresses interest in joining, all you need to do is direct them to the <a href=\"https://joinapp.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty join application link</a> and ask them to name you as their sponsor in the application. That’s it! eXp Realty automates everything from there.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-an-e-xp-realty-frontline-agent\"><strong>What is an eXp Realty Frontline Agent?</strong></h3>\n<p>Agents that join eXp and name you as their sponsor are known as your <strong>frontline agents</strong> or <strong>Tier 1 agents</strong>. These agents are also referred to as <strong>Front Line Qualifying Agents (FLQAs)</strong> when they are actively producing income by closing deals. You’ll earn a small percentage of their earned commissions each year until they hit their cap.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-e-xp-realty-network-of-agents-expands\"><strong>Your eXp Realty Network of Agents Expands</strong></h3>\n<p>Your revenue share income doesn’t stop with your frontline agents. When your Tier 1 agents sponsor new agents to join eXp, those new agents become your <strong>Tier 2 agents</strong>, and you’ll earn a small percentage of their commissions as well. This pattern continues down <strong>seven tiers</strong>, creating a powerful network of agents in your <strong>downline</strong>.</p>\n<p>As each tier of agents sponsors new producing agents, your earning potential grows exponentially. To maximize your revenue share income, you’ll need to unlock each tier by meeting specific FLQA requirements. I’ll explain that in more detail below.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exponential-growth-with-revenue-share\"><strong>Exponential Growth with Revenue Share</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Revenue share income isn’t just a nice bonus—it can be life-changing. Some eXp agents are earning <strong>6, 7, and even 8 figures annually</strong> from revenue share alone, on top of their production commissions. How does this happen? It’s all about the <strong>seven-tier structure</strong> and the cascading effect of growth.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/abe19ac6c856db5f-Revenue-Share-Calculator-About-eXp.webp/public\" alt=\"Revenue Share Calculator About eXp\" class=\"wp-image-264891 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Revenue-Share-Calculator-About-eXp.webp 640w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Revenue-Share-Calculator-About-eXp-300x169.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"heres-how-it-works\"><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></h3>\n<p>When you sponsor an agent directly, they become your <strong>Tier 1 agent</strong>, and you earn a percentage of their commissions. If your Tier 1 agent sponsors another agent, that new agent becomes your <strong>Tier 2 agent</strong>, and you’ll earn from their commissions too. This pattern continues down to <strong>Tier 7</strong>, creating a network of agents who contribute to your revenue share income.</p>\n<p>Let’s break it down with numbers to show just how powerful this system can be:<br />Imagine you sponsor just <strong>2 producing agents,</strong> and each of them sponsors <strong>2 more agents</strong>, who then sponsor <strong>2 more agents</strong>, and so on. By the time you reach <strong>Tier 7</strong>, those initial 2 agents have grown into a network of <strong>128 agents</strong>, all contributing to your revenue share income. That’s not just income—that’s <strong>magical exponential growth</strong>!</p>\n<p><strong>See It in Action</strong>: Want to explore how this could work for you?

That is, real estate agents usually stop earning an income when they stop doing real estate transactions, but at eXp Realty, agent sponsors can retire and still get their revenue share residual income indefinitely! Wow, financial freedom!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-agents-can-die-and-still-provide-for-loved-ones\"><strong>eXp Agents Can Die and Still Provide for Loved Ones</strong></h3>\n<p>Furthermore, an agent&#8217;s eXp revenue share income is willable. That&#8217;s right! When an agent sponsor dies, their loved ones can continue receiving the revenue share income stream. Furthermore, because of the 7-tier structure, that income may even grow larger over time. It&#8217;s a powerful way to provide ongoing financial support for family members.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"generating-multiple-streams-of-income\"><strong>Generating Multiple Streams of Income</strong></h3>\n<p>Participating in revenue share opens up avenues for agents to generate multiple streams of income within eXp&#8217;s business model. eXp agents can also earn from commissions as real estate agents and as referral agents, and they can earn from their <a href=\"https://expworldholdings.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp stock</a> purchases and awards. <strong>More about eXp income streams here.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brilliance-of-e-xp-realty-revenue-share-program-everyone-wins\">Brilliance of eXp Realty Revenue Share Program &#8211; Everyone Wins</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Let’s face it—eXp Realty’s revenue share program isn’t just good; it’s downright brilliant. Why? Because it’s designed so that <strong>everyone wins</strong>: agents, sponsors, and eXp Realty itself. It’s a model that creates incentives and support you won’t find at traditional brokerages. Here’s how it works its magic:</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"549\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/27aba200e1cfe148-REVenue-Share-2.0-pie-chart-with-FLQA-Requirements-May-2024-1024x549.webp/public\" alt=\"REVenue Share 2.0 pie chart with FLQA Requirements - May 2024\" class=\"wp-image-240229 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/REVenue-Share-2.0-pie-chart-with-FLQA-Requirements-May-2024-1024x549.webp 1024w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/REVenue-Share-2.0-pie-chart-with-FLQA-Requirements-May-2024-300x161.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/REVenue-Share-2.0-pie-chart-with-FLQA-Requirements-May-2024-768x412.webp 768w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/REVenue-Share-2.0-pie-chart-with-FLQA-Requirements-May-2024.webp 1333w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agents-win-support-success-and-exponential-growth\"><strong>Agents Win: Support, Success, and Exponential Growth</strong></h3>\n<p>Agents at eXp Realty get the best of both worlds. Not only do they earn commissions from their own real estate transactions, but they also benefit from the <strong>7-tier sponsorship structure</strong>. Here’s the kicker: agents receive support from their <strong>“upline”</strong>—the seven sponsors above them—while also building their own <strong>downline</strong> of agents they’ve sponsored. It’s like having a built-in support system and a growing income stream, all in one.</p>\n<p>But here’s the real gem: sponsors only earn revenue share when their downline agents are actively earning commissions. This means sponsors are <strong>incentivized to help their agents succeed</strong>. Whether it’s sharing tips, providing training, or offering mentorship, sponsors have a vested interest in seeing their downline thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: Not all sponsors are created equal. While eXp doesn’t require sponsors to provide support, some (like <strong>Smart Agent Alliance</strong>) go above and beyond to help their agents succeed. Choosing the right sponsor can make all the difference in your revenue share journey.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sponsors-win-income-impact-and-fulfillment\"><strong>Sponsors Win: Income, Impact, and Fulfillment</strong></h3>\n<p>For sponsors, the revenue share program is a win-win. Not only do they earn extra income from their downline agents’ commissions, but they also get the satisfaction of helping others succeed. It’s not just about making money—it’s about <strong>making a difference</strong>.</p>\n<p>Imagine this: you help an agent join eXp, and they go on to build a thriving real estate career. Then, they sponsor others, who sponsor others, and so on. Before you know it, you’ve created a ripple effect of success, and you’re earning revenue share income every step of the way. It’s like planting seeds and watching a forest grow.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-wins-happy-agents-rapid-growth-and-a-thriving-community\"><strong>eXp Wins: Happy Agents, Rapid Growth, and a Thriving Community</strong></h3>\n<p>Of course, eXp Realty wins too. By fostering a culture of collaboration and mutual support, eXp creates an environment where agents are happy, motivated, and eager to share the opportunity with others. This has helped eXp become the <strong>fastest-growing brokerage on the planet</strong>.</p>\n<p>But it’s not just about growth—it’s about creating a community where agents feel supported, valued, and empowered to achieve their goals. When agents win, eXp wins. And when eXp wins, agents win even more. It’s a beautiful cycle of success.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"who-can-earn-revenue-share-income\">Who Can Earn Revenue Share Income?</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/61b99463c96c2d20-The-New-Revenue-Share-Enhancements.webp/public\" alt=\"Close-up of a person wearing glasses, with reflections of data and graphs, symbolizing the clarity and improved potential of the exp revenue share program.\" class=\"wp-image-240218\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-New-Revenue-Share-Enhancements.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-New-Revenue-Share-Enhancements-300x75.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-New-Revenue-Share-Enhancements-768x191.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned pro or just starting out in the real estate industry, you have the potential to boost your income through the powerful revenue share program offered by eXp.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"new-agents-to-e-xp-realty-can-start-immediately\"><strong>New Agents to eXp Realty Can Start Immediately</strong></h3>\n<p>One common misconception among new agents is that they need to spend months or years at eXp before they begin attracting other agents to join. However, this is not true! In fact, some sponsorship groups have devised a clever structure where experienced agents from the new agent&#8217;s upline take on much of the heavy lifting. That&#8217;s the power of Smart Agent Alliance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"selling-houses-isnt-a-requirement\"><strong>Selling Houses Isn&#8217;t a Requirement</strong></h3>\n<p>Selling houses is not necessary to earn revenue share income. Being an active real estate agent certainly has its perks, but it is not mandatory for earning a revenue share income. Agents can choose to both sell houses and sponsor agents to the company or they can choose to do one or the other.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-is-e-xp-realtys-revenue-share-income-paid-for\">How is eXp Realty&#8217;s Revenue Share Income Paid For?</h2>\n<p>Let’s get into the nitty-gritty of how eXp Realty’s revenue share income works—because understanding where the money comes from is key to seeing just how awesome this program is!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-magic-of-e-xps-company-dollar\"><strong>The Magic of eXp’s Company Dollar</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s the deal: your revenue share income doesn’t come out of the pockets of the agents you sponsor. Instead, it comes from <strong>eXp’s company dollar</strong>. Here’s how it breaks down:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Until agents hit their <strong>$16,000 cap</strong>, they earn an <strong>80/20 commission split</strong>. That means agents keep 80% of their commissions, and eXp keeps 20%.</li>\n<li>Out of that 20%, eXp is committed to paying sponsors <strong>50% of that</strong> as revenue share income. So, when you sponsor agents, you’re earning a slice of that 10%—not from the agents themselves, but from eXp’s share.</li>\n<li>Once an agent hits their cap, they keep 100% of their commissions for the rest of the year, and eXp stops collecting the 20% split. That means revenue share income is earned only while agents are working toward their cap.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-sponsors-get-paid\"><strong>How Sponsors Get Paid</strong></h3>\n<p>Revenue share income is distributed to sponsors based on the performance of their downline agents. The more productive your downline is, the more you earn. It’s that simple. And because eXp automates the entire process, you don’t have to worry about tracking commissions or managing payments—it’s all taken care of for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-revenue-share-minimum-payouts-percentages\">eXp Realty Revenue Share Minimum Payouts &#038; Percentages</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"670\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ab0556a81b214dc1-eXp-Realty-Revenue-Share-Chart.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty revenue share payout chart showing tiered earnings per capping agent, including FLQA requirements and bonus eligibility\" class=\"wp-image-268760 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eXp-Realty-Revenue-Share-Chart.webp 800w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eXp-Realty-Revenue-Share-Chart-300x251.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eXp-Realty-Revenue-Share-Chart-768x643.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This chart shows the minimum payout sponsors earn per capping agent in their downline each year. Sponsors are paid a percentage of each agent&#8217;s commissions as those commissions are being earned. Additionally, agents earn more from a bonus pool on their levels 1 &#8211; 3. In the past, that payout has been 20 &#8211; 50% higher than these minimums.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-e-xps-approach-is-different\"><strong>Why eXp’s Approach is Different</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s where eXp Realty really stands out: while most other brokerages with revenue share models advertise <strong>“maximum” payout potential</strong>, eXp does the opposite. Instead of overpromising, eXp provides <strong>minimum payout numbers</strong>, ensuring that agents have a realistic understanding of what they can earn.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-other-words\">In other words:</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Other brokerages might quote <strong>inflated numbers</strong> to make their programs seem more attractive, but those numbers often don’t reflect reality.</li>\n<li>eXp, on the other hand, <strong>underpromises and over-delivers</strong>. The minimum payouts are just the starting point, and the bonus pool often pushes earnings much higher.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach reflects eXp’s commitment to transparency and fairness. It’s not about flashy marketing—it’s about delivering real value to agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"profit-share-vs-revenue-share\"><strong>Profit Share vs Revenue Share</strong></h3>\n<p>One common question is: <strong>What&#8217;s the difference between profit share and revenue share?</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Profit Share</strong>:<br />In profit share programs, earnings are distributed based on the profits of a company after expenses. This means that payouts can be less predictable and often lower, as they depend on the company&#8217;s profitability after costs. For example, Keller Williams has a profit-sharing program.  More about that below.</li>\n<li><strong>Revenue Share</strong>:<br />eXp Realty&#8217;s revenue share program distributes earnings based on the <strong>revenue</strong> generated by agents, not profits. This ensures more consistent and higher payouts for agents, as it&#8217;s not dependent on the company&#8217;s expenses. Revenue share is a more transparent and lucrative model for agents, allowing them to earn more from their efforts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"revenue-share-2-0-enhancements\">Revenue Share 2.0 Enhancements</h2>\n<p>In 2024, eXp introduced several enhancements to make revenue share even more lucrative and accessible:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong> Removal of FLQA Requirements for Tiers 2 and 3</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Previously, agents needed a certain number of FLQAs to unlock Tiers 2 and 3. Now, more agents can earn from these tiers without meeting those thresholds.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong> Fast Start Attraction Bonus</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you sponsor a new agent, you can earn <strong>50% of the revenue share pool</strong> from their first year, up to <strong>$4,000</strong> for fully capped agents or <strong>5% of their Gross Commission Income (GCI)</strong> during their capping period.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong> “Pay Now” Feature</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the <strong>“Pay Now” feature</strong>, you can instantly access your revenue share income as soon as a transaction closes—no more waiting for the monthly check. The cost? Just a <strong>$1 introductory fee</strong>. This feature has been a game-changer for agents who want more control over their finances. Whether you’re covering closing costs, investing in your business, or simply enjoying the fruits of your labor, the “Pay Now” feature ensures your money is available when you need it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"explore-more-about-e-xp-revenue-share\">Explore More About eXp Revenue Share</h2>\n<p>If you’re curious about how eXp’s revenue share program compares to other brokerages like <strong>Keller Williams</strong>, <strong>Exit Realty</strong>, and <strong>Real Brokerage</strong>, or if you want to understand why eXp’s model is <strong>not a pyramid scheme</strong>, we’ve got you covered.

On average, <a href=\"https://solutions.exprealty.com/uncategorized/clearwater-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp agents bank more than $8,000</a> each year from switching to eXp Realty Healthcare – that’s a whopping 60% or more reduction in fixed medical expenses. But the savings don’t stop there. Clearwater reports an eye-popping <a href=\"https://www.clearwaterhealth.com/for-individuals-and-families\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80% drop in out-of-pocket costs</a> for eXp agents compared to traditional health insurance plans.

When comparing eXp Realty with other big brokerages such as Coldwell Banker, Remas, KW, Berkshire Hathoway, Compass, and even Real, eXp shines. Of all these brokerages, only eXp offers exclusive health plans for their agents. Additionally, only eXp Realty has innovative healthcare plans that save agents thousands of dollars every year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"success-stories\">Success Stories</h2>\n<p>Ready for some personal actual agent stories? When eXp Realty Healthcare became an option, many eXp agents decided to give it a go. Here are some of their stories.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cancer-diagnosis-dollar8000-saved-annually\">Cancer Diagnosis &#8211; $8000 Saved Annually</h3>\n<p>At 26<a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-agent-healthcare-silverman-sinnona/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">, Florida realtor Beth Silverman</a> fought breast cancer alongside struggles to secure and afford health insurance as an independent contractor. Beth said, “Being a real estate agent meant endless battles for insurance that normal people who have not been touched by cancer can never understand.”</p>\n<p>Now in remission, Beth faced recurring challenges such as annual re-enrollment, soaring premiums, and restricted networks. By switching to eXp Realty Healthcare, Beth saves roughly $8,000 annually on premiums. She says, “I have a cost-sharing plan through eXp, and it’s different than what people are used to. It’s community-based, and trust me … I’m saving thousands in the yearly premium, and prescription costs are a bit cheaper.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"same-doctors-same-care-quality-dollar10000-saved-annually\">Same Doctors, Same Care Quality &#8211; $10,000 Saved Annually</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-agent-healthcare-silverman-sinnona/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joe Sinnona from Long Beach</a>, New York, an eXp agent, discovered substantial savings with eXp Realty Healthcare Clearwater compared to his previous health plan. In 2018, Joe was paying $1,500 a month for his family’s health insurance, and the cost was set to increase to $1,850.</p>\n<p>Facing these rising costs, Joe and his wife considered dropping their coverage but ultimately found a more affordable solution through eXp. Now, they pay just $791 monthly for the family’s healthcare and have even added dental coverage for an additional $100 a month.</p>\n<p>Joe shares, “Same doctors, same quality of care. I raised the deductible and was able to get this affordable healthcare plan through eXp Realty.” He aims to serve as a testament to other agents seeking reliable and cost-effective health insurance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"same-doctors-dollar12000-saved-annually\">Same Doctors &#8211; $12,000 Saved Annually</h3>\n<p>Drew Schroeder from Indianapolis, an eXp Realty ICON Agent, found himself reevaluating his health insurance as <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-agent-healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">costs soared to $1,588 per month</a>. After consulting his financial advisors and discussing the eXp Realty Healthcare Clearwater plan via a thorough Zoom meeting, Drew was convinced by the plan’s value.</p>\n<p>In Drew’s words, “This is a special program your company is offering you. You need to do it.” By switching, Drew saves over $12,000 annually while maintaining the same doctors for his family. He appreciates how eXp helps bridge common gaps for agents, allowing him to focus on family and his career without the stress of healthcare costs.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"innovative-solutions-for-the-best-solution\">Innovative Solutions for the Best Solution</h3>\n<p>When Gogo Bethke’s husband left his corporate job, the family lost their employer-provided health insurance. Gogo was shocked at the high cost of open-market healthcare. <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-agent-healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Previously paying around $900 monthly</a>, including coverage for their son who has Type 1 diabetes, they needed an affordable alternative.</p>\n<p>Clearwater offered a personalized solution, splitting their son’s coverage into an open market plan and the rest of the family’s into a Clearwater plan. Now, Gogo pays about $400 for her son’s plan and $865 for the family, which is significantly less than potential open-market costs.</p>\n<p>Gogo said “It’s still much cheaper than the open market where we would be paying three times the cost”. Plus, Gogo says that the Clearwater plan her family chose offers very inexpensive prescriptions, diagnostic services, and doctor visits.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-plans-do-exp-agents-typically-choose\">What Plans Do eXp Agents Typically Choose?</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/82a603abcaa4d10a-What-Plans-Do-eXp-Agents-Typically-Choose.png/public\" alt=\"a man in a suit and hat.

With eXp Healthcare, agents finally get access to real, affordable, high-quality coverage that doesn’t feel like a second full-time job to figure out. And the numbers speak for themselves: thousands saved per year, better networks, no annoying enrollment deadlines, and expert support that doesn’t ghost you when you need answers.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker—this level of agent-first innovation isn’t just about health plans.
