Let’s go over some of those advantages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"free\">Free</h3>\n<p>First off, let&#8217;s talk about everyone&#8217;s favorite word: <strong>FREE.</strong> That&#8217;s right, from Facebook to LinkedIn, social media marketing for real estate agents can be accessed on these platforms without costing you a single dime and they offer access to a vast pool of potential clients.</p>\n<p>Now that doesn’t mean you won’t want to spend some money with it by maybe hiring an editor or buying some ads, but the bottom line, social media marketing for real estate agents can be successfully done for free.</p>\n<h3 id=\"know-like-and-trust-factor\">Know, Like &#038; Trust Factor</h3>\n<p>One compelling advantage of social media for real estate agents lies in its remarkable <strong>efficiency and effectiveness</strong>. That is, as potential buyers and sellers scroll through your awesome content, they’re not just learning about your business!</p>\n<p>Those viewers are also naturally getting to know you, liking your vibe, and trusting your expertise. In other words, they are getting to know, like, and trust you.</p>\n<p>This know, like, and trust principle is a key marketing concept that suggests people are more inclined to work with those they feel connected to. Building those factors with your social media paves the way for seamless conversions from curious browsers to loyal clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attracts-clients-not-leads\">Attracts Clients, Not Leads</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4275 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success.webp\" alt=\"A new real estate agent joyfully shaking hands with clients, celebrating a successful deal.\" width=\"447\" height=\"255\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" /></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the <strong>HUGE advantage</strong> of social media marketing for real estate agents: it&#8217;s not merely about collecting leads—it&#8217;s about seamlessly snagging clients.</p>\n<p>Think of it this way: Traditional marketing can feel like running a marathon with a backpack full of bricks—it’s exhaustive, requiring years of nurturing before a lead finally becomes a client, often draining both your time and money along the way.</p>\n<p>But social media? That offers a <strong>shortcut path</strong> without the bricks. When someone reaches out to you, they&#8217;re already past the window-shopping phase.

Your content is more than just attractive visuals and clever captions; it&#8217;s actively warming up potential clients for you.</p>\n<p>It transforms the traditional, slow conversion process into a more streamlined and effective journey, making it easier for you to convert leads into real, committed clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"works-247\">Works 24/7</h3>\n<p>Hold on, it gets even juicier!

It&#8217;s a goldmine for agents looking to broaden their reach and dial up their sales game. Here’s the lowdown on why YouTube is your go-to for taking your real estate biz to the next level:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-its-totally-free-seriously\"><strong>1. It’s Totally Free!</strong></h3>\n<p>Jumping on YouTube will take some guts but it won’t cost you a dime. Sure, you’ll need to put in some time to get your channel looking sharp and keep it filled with fresh content, but when it comes to lead generation?</p>\n<p>YouTube’s where it’s at, with each viewer it’s handing out opportunities left and right, for free. Investing a bit of your time can open the floodgates to leads that don’t add a cent to your marketing budget. It’s a trade-off worth making.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-skyrocket-your-visibility\"><strong>2. Skyrocket Your Visibility</strong></h3>\n<p>Think of YouTube as the VIP room of the internet&#8217;s party, where Google is the host. By setting up shop on YouTube, you&#8217;re not just getting a corner table; you&#8217;re getting the spotlight. Here&#8217;s the kicker: everything you upload gets a chance to shine on Google&#8217;s search results too.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s like hitting two birds with one stone — or better yet, catching the eyes of potential clients on both the world&#8217;s top search engine and its second-in-command, YouTube. With over 2 billion logged-in users each month, the exposure is massive.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve got two powerful streams funneling attention to your channel: people typing away on Google and the YouTube crowd. For realtors, this means your property tours, buying tips, and market insights have the potential to be seen by an audience as BIG as the housing market itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-expand-your-reach-break-borders\"><strong>3. Expand Your Reach, Break Borders</strong></h3>\n<p>YouTube&#8217;s user base isn&#8217;t just huge; it&#8217;s worldwide, offering your real estate services a ticket to international exposure. Imagine a potential buyer in another country, dreaming of a new home in your area, stumbling upon your video. That&#8217;s the power of YouTube.</p>\n<p>Your listings and advice aren’t just whispers in the local market; they&#8217;re broadcast worldwide, 24/7, to anyone with an internet connection.</p>\n<p>And there’s the magic of shareability. With just a click, your audience can make your content leap from YouTube to any social media platform, multiplying your visibility. In the real estate world, where word-of-mouth and networking reign supreme, YouTube is your digital megaphone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-elevate-your-expertise-build-trust\"><strong>4. Elevate Your Expertise, Build Trust</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4504 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-3.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-3.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-3-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, launching into YouTube isn’t just about showcasing properties; it’s about showcasing you — your knowledge, your personality, your brand. A well-curated YouTube channel brimming with insightful content does more than just attract eyeballs; it builds your credibility and positions you as an industry authority.</p>\n<p>Picture this: viewers tuning into your market analysis, town tours or buying tips, start to see you not just as a realtor but as a trusted advisor, maybe even a local celebrity of sorts. This visibility fosters a sense of familiarity and trust, which is gold in real estate.</p>\n<p>After all, buying a home is a big decision, and people gravitate towards agents they feel they know and can rely on. By consistently delivering value through your videos, answering the big questions, and demystifying the buying and selling process, you&#8217;re not just earning views; you&#8217;re earning trust, confidence, and ultimately, clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-turbocharge-your-site-with-seo-superpowers\"><strong>5. Turbocharge Your Site with SEO Superpowers</strong></h3>\n<p>When you dive into the world of YouTube, you&#8217;re not just stepping up your video game; you&#8217;re giving your website&#8217;s SEO a major boost.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the scoop: Google loves videos. Websites that integrate video content, especially from YouTube, often enjoy a more favorable spot in search rankings. It&#8217;s like Google&#8217;s giving you a high-five for making your site more engaging.</p>\n<p>By embedding your YouTube videos on your website, you&#8217;re essentially creating a two-way street — more visibility for your videos, and a turbo boost in traffic for your site. Plus, when your YouTube content links back to your site, you&#8217;re knitting a web of digital connections that Google can&#8217;t resist.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-convert-viewers-into-clients-with-ease\"><strong>6. Convert Viewers into Clients with Ease</strong></h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about turning the views you get on YouTube into victories. Research backs it up: websites sporting video content aren&#8217;t just catching eyes; they&#8217;re converting casual browsers into committed clients at a higher rate.</p>\n<p>Why? Because videos are the secret sauce to building trust, likability, and a sense of connection. Your YouTube channel showcases you. It&#8217;s your platform to let potential clients get to know the real you, your expertise, and your values.</p>\n<p>By the time viewers reach out, they&#8217;re not just leads &#8211; they&#8217;re pre-sold on you as their go-to realtor. It&#8217;s like your videos are doing the heavy lifting, so by the time prospects hit &#8220;contact,&#8221; they&#8217;re already convinced they want to work with you. Talk about a smooth conversion pathway!</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-ways-to-build-authority-through-real-estate-youtube-channels\">4 Ways to Build Authority Through Real Estate YouTube Channels</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4496\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"483\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-2-300x145.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-2-768x371.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"1-effective-video-content-strategy-for-realtors-on-youtube\">1. Effective Video Content Strategy for Realtors on YouTube</h3>\n<p>The most important thing for you to do when it comes to YouTube is to provide content that viewers are actually eager to watch. Here&#8217;s how you can nail it:</p>\n<h4 id=\"local-information\"><strong>Unlocking the Local Lifestyle</strong></h4>\n<p>Your insider knowledge is a treasure trove for those eyeing your area as their next home base. Dive into the essence of what makes living there special.</p>\n<p>From insider information about your town to detailed information about different neighborhoods, to a curated list of the top cafes, activities, and can’t-miss events, you have the power to bring your area to life for viewers. It’s about mixing practical advice with local flavor, giving a well-rounded view of the community you serve.</p>\n<p>Here are some video title ideas: “Pros and Cons of Living in your city”, “Top Dog Boarding Places in your city”, “Top 5 Activities to Do in your city”, “Gated Communities in your city”, Waterfront Living in your city”.  You get it, the potential list goes on and on.</p>\n<h4>Market Insights</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4089 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-1.webp\" alt=\"Collaborative Growth - Real Estate Professionals Engaged in Discussion at a Free Investor Group Meeting\" width=\"427\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-1.webp 427w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-1-300x200.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px\" /></p>\n<p>This is your chance to shine as a real estate sage. Realtors should talk about what&#8217;s happening in real estate, both locally, on the state level, and nationally. Analyze the current real estate landscape clearly and insightfully.</p>\n<p>This could include trends like rising or falling house prices, changes in days on market for selling a home, and how many homes are for sale (housing inventory). Imagine a captivating video that unpacks the reasons behind soaring house prices in a particular locale, making the complex market trends digestible and engaging for your viewers.</p>\n<p>Your aim is to enlighten and inform. You reveal your expertise through this analysis helping potential clients gain trust in you. You also give your viewers knowledge which makes them feel more confident about their decisions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"expert-tips\"><strong>Crafting Expertise with Savvy Tips</strong></h4>\n<p>Elevate your expertise by dishing out savvy advice on the home buying and selling journey. Create a series that walks buyers through the maze of purchasing their dream home or guides sellers on the art of clinching a swift sale.</p>\n<p>Sprinkle wisdom about how to stage a home for sale or how buyers should pick a lender.

This storytelling approach lets you shine a light on your expertise and dedication without sounding self-congratulatory.</p>\n<p>After weaving these engaging success stories, sprinkle in testimonials from your satisfied clients. Hearing directly from those who&#8217;ve experienced your exceptional service first-hand can sway potential clients in your favor.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these stories of success plant seeds of hope and aspiration in viewers, whether they&#8217;re on the brink of buying or selling. It&#8217;s about painting a picture of what&#8217;s possible when they choose you as their realtor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-elevating-your-content-for-real-estate-youtube-channels\">2. Elevating Your Content for Real Estate YouTube Channels</h3>\n<p>Now that you know what content to create, let’s dial up attracting people to your content by exploring some other content improvements.</p>\n<h4>Maximizing Your Smartphone for Professional-Quality Real Estate Videos: The Importance of Sound and Lighting</h4>\n<p>Creating high-quality real estate content doesn&#8217;t necessarily require expensive equipment. You can film your videos with your cell phone, yielding impressive results. However, pay close attention to sound and lighting, as these elements play a significant role in the overall quality of your videos.</p>\n<p>Good lighting, which can be had with a couple of well-placed lights or turning away from the sun just perfectly, ensures your video footage looks inviting. Clear sound is also essential for conveying your message effectively.</p>\n<p>No one wants to listen to you talking while your voice is competing with loud background noises. Invest in an inexpensive microphone to connect to your phone. You can get decent mics for as little as $15 on Amazon. That’s well worth the investment.</p>\n<p>By ensuring your videos are well-lit and the audio is crisp and clear, you can create compelling content that competes with professionally shot videos, all from the convenience of your smartphone.</p>\n<h4 id=\"effective-video-editing-for-real-estate-content-on-youtube\">Effective Video Editing for Real Estate Content on YouTube</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4503 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-3.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"477\" height=\"272\" title=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now that you’ve filmed your content, it’s time to edit your raw video footage. Use CapCut for free, it’s super great and super easy to use – watch a couple of YouTube videos on CapCut to quickly master it.</p>\n<p>Or if you want to pay for editing software, and there isn’t any reason to do so, then I’d recommend Wondershare Filmora.  Ok, on to the editing.</p>\n<p>Of course, you’ll likely cut out your errors or footage that doesn’t add to your content first.

Smooth transitions are the backbone of professional-looking content, guiding the viewer through your town, neighborhoods, and properties as if they were walking through it themselves.\n<p>Whether you’re transitioning from a restaurant to a walking path or a sunlit living room to a cozy bedroom, using gentle fades or sleek slide effects can significantly enhance the viewing experience. It’s these polished transitions that knit your shots into a seamless narrative, keeping viewers hooked from start to finish.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Inclusive Engagement with Captions &#8211; </strong>Expanding your reach means ensuring your content is accessible to everyone. Adding captions isn’t just thoughtful; it’s strategic, opening up your videos to an international audience and those who prefer watching without sound.\n<p>Whether they’re scrolling through YouTube in a café &#8211; so they don’t want to bother other people &#8211; or they rely on captions for accessibility to different languages, this feature ensures no potential client misses out on discovering their dream home through your video.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Crafting Compact Yet Captivating Videos &#8211; </strong>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world, where attention spans are shorter than ever, crafting concise yet impactful videos is key. It&#8217;s crucial to hone your message, trimming it down to engaging, digestible highlights without sacrificing the unique elements that set your content apart.\n<p>Avoid blathering on and on or diluting your video with unnecessary filler. Stick to what&#8217;s relevant and central to your core message. A tightly edited video that swiftly captures and holds the viewer&#8217;s interest not only shows respect for viewers’ time but also leaves them intrigued and eager for more.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Elevate with Entertaining Edits &#8211; </strong>To truly stand out, infuse your videos with elements that entertain as well as inform. Incorporating B-roll footage adds depth to your narrative, offering viewers a fuller picture of what you have to say about your town, neighborhood, or properties.\n<p>Strategic use of stickers, sound effects, and dynamic pans and zooms can inject personality and flair into your content, making for a more entertaining viewing experience. These creative touches not only enhance the visual appeal of your videos but also significantly improve watch time by keeping viewers engaged and entertained throughout.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start to decide on these entertaining elements? Watch the content of others until you find something that you find entertaining. Try to emulate that.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Sky-High Views with Drone Footage</strong></h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4502 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"452\" height=\"258\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-2.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-2-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" /></p>\n<p>Elevate your town tours, neighborhood tours and property showcases with the magic of drone footage. This isn&#8217;t just about giving a bird&#8217;s eye view; it&#8217;s about offering a mesmerizing perspective that ground-level shots can&#8217;t capture.</p>\n<p>Drone footage turns ordinary tours into an extraordinary visual journey, highlighting homes and places with stunning clarity.</p>\n<p>Does this sound expensive? Well, it can add up if you’re hiring a local expert for every drone shot. But, you don’t need to do that. Invest in your own drone. You can get one for under $400 on Amazon.</p>\n<p>I use DJI Mini Pro 3. It’s more expensive than the starter drones, but I appreciate that it has some settings for moving the drone in the sky. Without those, I find that the drone shots can be a bit jerky and I spend a lot of time just editing out those jerks. So, the drone I use saves me editing time which, for me, is worth the additional expense.</p>\n<h4><strong>Connect and Clarify with Live Q&#038;A Sessions</strong></h4>\n<p>Another way to up your content game is to get more real with live Q&#038;A sessions. This interactive format invites viewers to dive in and ask their burning questions, creating a direct line of communication between you and your audience.</p>\n<p>Tackling topics like the intricacies of mortgages or the specifics of closing costs during these sessions offers a prime opportunity to demystify the real estate process. It&#8217;s a chance to directly address viewer concerns, simplify the complexities of the industry, and highlight your expertise and personality.</p>\n<p>And remember, you don&#8217;t have to go it solo. Bringing in a co-host, whether it’s a colleague or an industry expert, can enrich the session, broadening the scope of knowledge and insights you can offer. This collaborative approach ensures your audience gets comprehensive answers to their questions.</p>\n<p>Unsure of how to kick things off? YouTube Live hosts these engaging streaming sessions. Do a google search on how to get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-mastering-calls-to-action-transform-viewers-into-clients-with-your-real-estate-youtube-content\"><strong>3. Mastering Calls to Action: Transform Viewers into Clients with Your Real Estate YouTube Content</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4500 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"454\" height=\"259\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-1.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-1-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" /></p>\n<p>Crafting compelling Calls to Action (CTAs) in your real estate videos is crucial for converting viewers into active participants in your business. Here’s how to effectively guide your audience to the next step:</p>\n<h4><strong>Grow Your Viewers by Encouraging Subscriptions</strong></h4>\n<p>Building your YouTube presence hinges on expanding your subscriber base. During your video or at its end, remind your viewers to like, subscribe, and hit the bell notifications so that they will be notified of the next time you drop some more information.</p>\n<h4><strong>Offer Value &#038; Personal Contact</strong></h4>\n<p>Conclude your videos with a warm invitation for viewers to connect with you directly. A simple yet effective CTA like, &#8220;To learn more or see this property, reach out to me. My contact information is in the description below.” This prompts immediate action and helps to make viewers feel uniquely valued.</p>\n<p>For those not ready for immediate action, expand your client base by offering a newsletter sign-up or a home buyer or home seller guide. I like to make these CTAs as easy as possible for people. For example, you could say, “To get my free real estate newsletter, email me with the subject line “newsletter”.</p>\n<p>This approach builds your database of interested leads providing you the opportunity for continuous nurturing, keeping you top of mind for when they&#8217;re ready to make their move. By delivering valuable content regularly, you establish a relationship of trust and expertise.</p>\n<h4><strong>Amplify Your Reach: Promote Sharing</strong></h4>\n<p>Leveraging the power of sharing can dramatically extend your video’s visibility. Encourage viewers to pass your content along by saying, &#8220;Found this guide helpful? Share it with someone embarking on their home-buying adventure!&#8221; This strategy not only widens your audience but also enhances your credibility, as personal recommendations carry considerable weight.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-considering-targeting-a-specific-audience-with-relevant-content\">4. Considering Targeting a Specific Audience With Relevant Content</h3>\n<p>Now that you know what topics to cover in your videos, how to keep viewers watching your content, and how to encourage people to reach out to you, you can take your efforts a step further by targeting specific audiences that can truly set you apart as a niche expert.</p>\n<p>This targeted approach to specific audiences not only attracts your ideal market but also positions you as the go-to agent within that niche. Explore these potential focus areas to refine your content strategy:</p>\n<h4><strong>Guidance for First-Time Homebuyers</strong></h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4277 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling.webp\" alt=\"Smiling real estate agent engaged in a cold call conversation, showcasing effective communication for client prospecting.\" width=\"461\" height=\"263\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" /></p>\n<p>First-time homebuyers often embark on their property journey feeling overwhelmed and uncertain. Tailoring your content to demystify the home-buying process for them can be incredibly impactful.</p>\n<p>Start with foundational topics, such as breaking down mortgage basics or strategies for saving for a down payment, presented in straightforward, accessible language. This builds trust and empowers buyers to approach the buying process with confidence.</p>\n<p>Video ideas to consider include: &#8220;Navigating Your First Home Purchase: Avoid These Common Pitfalls&#8221; and &#8220;Essential Saving Tips for Your First Home Investment&#8221;. Your goal is to be the reassuring guide that transforms the daunting into the doable for these buyers.</p>\n<h4><strong>Catering to the Luxury Market</strong></h4>\n<p>Clients in the luxury market have distinct expectations and preferences. Your content should mirror the sophistication and exclusivity they&#8217;re accustomed to, with a focus on high-end properties and the luxurious lifestyle they entail.</p>\n<p>Suggested video topics include: &#8220;A Glimpse into [Your Area’s] Most Opulent Homes&#8221; and &#8220;Navigating the Luxury Real Estate Market: Insider Tips&#8221;. Employ visually striking thumbnails and compelling descriptions to capture the attention of this discerning audience from the get-go.</p>\n<h4><strong>Spotlight on Family-Friendly Living</strong></h4>\n<p>Families looking for the perfect home prioritize factors like education, safety, and community. Videos that spotlight the merits of family-friendly suburbs, emphasizing aspects such as top-rated schools, neighborhood safety, and community events, can resonate deeply with this demographic.</p>\n<p>Demonstrating your knowledge of what truly matters to families shows that you’re not just selling houses, but homes that fit their dreams and needs. Video concepts to explore include: &#8220;Discovering [Your Area’s] Top Family-Friendly Neighborhoods&#8221; and &#8220;What to Look for in Your Next Family Home&#8221;</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Diving into YouTube presents an unrivaled opportunity for realtors to amplify their business, making it an indispensable tool in your digital marketing arsenal.

    "content": "<p>Let’s cut the fluff—starting a real estate career isn’t all sold signs and sunset selfies. Most new agents wash out before their business cards are even scuffed. I knew that. I’m a UC Berkeley Law grad, a former California attorney, and now a lawyer turned real estate agent. Translation: I don’t jump into risky ventures without some serious digging.</p>\n<p>So when it came time to choose my brokerage, I put on my lawyer hat and did the deep dive. Calls. Interviews. More Google tabs than anyone should admit. And what do I find? Most brokerages are stuck in the past, nickel-and-diming agents while offering very little in return. Then I found eXp Realty, and my entire view of what a real estate career could be shifted.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re trying to build a lasting eXp Realty career instead of becoming just another statistic in the 87% failure rate, this story’s for you.</p>\n<p>Here’s your handy-dandy index:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#real-estate-agent-failure-rate\">Real Estate Agent Failure Rate</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#realtors-as-entrepreneurs\">Realtors as Entrepreneurs</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#real-estate-is-risky-business\">Real Estate is Risky Business</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#my-traditional-brokerages-vs-exp-realty-research\">My Traditional Brokerages vs eXp Realty Research</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-split-pay-out\">Commission Split Pay Out</a></p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#traditional-brokerage-commission-split\">Traditional Brokerage Commission Split</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#exp-realty-commission-split\">eXp Realty Commission Split</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#fees-charged-to-real-estate-agents\">Fees Charged to Real Estate Agents</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-for-new-real-estate-agents\">Training for New Real Estate Agents</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#and-theres-more\">And, There’s More…</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-my-e-xp-realty-career-was-the-best-business-decision-ive-made\">Why My eXp Realty Career Was the Best Business Decision I’ve Made</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-estate-agent-failure-rate\"><strong>Real Estate Agent Failure Rate</strong></h2>\n<p>How did I know <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/brokerage-interview-questions/\">choosing the right brokerage</a> would be super important? Well, as a lawyer and real estate agent, I understood the risks involved. The National Association of Realtors reported that <strong>75% of realtors fail</strong> within the first year, and <a href=\"https://blog.tomferry.com/87-of-all-agents-fail-in-real-estate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>87% fail</strong> within five years</a>. <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/broker-news/network/why-do-new-sales-associates-fail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">There are lots of reasons for the agent failure rate.</a></p>\n<p>That’s right! Only <strong>13% of agents make it past a 5-year career</strong>! Oh my, better do some research to increase those odds.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"realtors-as-entrepreneurs\"><strong>Realtors as Entrepreneurs</strong></h2>\n<p>Before I jump into what I learned about different brokerages, the first key thing I learned in my quest to find a great brokerage was that agents operate as sole business owners. I hadn’t thought about that before.</p>\n<p>As a buyer and seller of my personal homes, I’ve worked with many agents over the decades and I always thought an agent’s brokerage was paying for something. I didn’t know what. Maybe the agent’s time? Maybe advertising costs for listings?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1.webp\" alt=\"Calculator with the word &#039;FEES&#039; on the display, surrounded by U.S. currency and coin stacks, depicting realtor expenses.\" class=\"wp-image-4438 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Beats me, but the way agents go on about how great their brokerages are, I assumed brokerages paid for some agent expenses of doing business. That is usually completely wrong. So that you don’t get blindsided, let me fill you in on some of what agents generally pay for:</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Costs of listing a home</strong> <strong>–</strong> Agents also pay for the costs of listing a home for sale – the professional photographers, the drones, the floor plans, the 3d home walk-throughs, the flyers, and other print marketing materials, all the advertising, and even the expense of the signs in front of the homes and the lockboxes that other agents will use to open the homes with their electronic app.</p>\n<p><strong>Association Fees</strong> <strong>–</strong> like fees to be members of professional associations like the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/broker-news/network/why-do-new-sales-associates-fail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Association of Realtors</a>, your state’s Association of Realtors, and your local agent association, and fees from <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/mls-online-listings/multiple-listing-service-mls-what-is-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your MLS</a> (which stands for multiple listing service).</p>\n<p><strong>Key fees</strong> <strong>–</strong> you know, those little electronic apps that agents use to open houses with their phones. Well, agents pay for that key access to their local MLS every month. And, if an agent does business outside their main MLS? Well, they will have to pay key fees for that too, and maybe the association fees of the area as well.</p>\n<p><strong>General Business Expenses</strong> <strong>–</strong> Agents also pay for the cost of <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/errors-omissions-eo-insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">E&#038;O insurance</a>, which stands for Errors &#038; Omissions, and all agents must have it. Agents also usually pay for their business cards, computers, phones, and cars, including all costs associated with using that car for business.</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Generation Costs –</strong> if you send postcards to a neighborhood to try to dig up some prospects, you’ll cover the costs of the design, printing, and postage for those. If you make phone calls, you’ll pay for a service to provide the phone numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you think a real estate agent just cashes big checks, think again. In this eXp Realty career (or any real estate path), agents front the costs—marketing, tools, time, gas, sanity. It’s all on us until (and unless) a deal closes—no salary, no safety net, just pure hustle.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-estate-is-risky-business\"><strong>Real Estate is Risky Business</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-1.webp\" alt=\"eXp Realty Career, Silhouette of a person tightrope walking between cliffs at sunset, embodying the risks of the real estate business.\" class=\"wp-image-4443\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-1-300x107.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-1-768x273.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Let’s be real: if the deal doesn’t close, the agent doesn’t get paid. That means hours (or months) of work can go straight to the unpaid labor hall of fame. As both a lawyer and a real estate agent, I don’t take lightly how unpredictable this career can be.</p>\n<p>You can’t control clients, the market, or whether that dream house suddenly sprouts mold in the attic. What can you control? Your brokerage. Choose wisely—your odds of success depend on it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"my-traditional-brokerages-vs-exp-realty-research\"><strong>My Traditional Brokerages vs eXp Realty Research</strong></h2>\n<p>I started my search for a brokerage online. I narrowed down my choices first based mostly on the size and “success” of the brokerage. Small firms didn’t interest me as I knew that those would never have enough big profits to provide great support, tools, resources, and innovation to meet changing needs over time.</p>\n<p>Here are the brokerages I chose to dive in further with: I researched traditional brokerages &#8211; Compass, Vanguard, Sotheby’s, Coldwell Banker, and Remax &#8211; because they are big names with a local presence.</p>\n<p>And, I also researched eXp Realty because it’s the fastest-growing brokerage in U.S. history and on the planet. That must mean something, and eXp also has listed stock and is part of the S&#038;P 600.</p>\n<p>My research strategy included looking up online information, talking with agents and managers at the various firms, and also meeting in person with some brokerage managers.</p>\n<p>Here are the highlights:</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-split-pay-out\">Commission Split Pay Out</h2>\n<p>What did I care about the most? Of course, how much would I get paid?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traditional-brokerage-commission-split\">Traditional Brokerage Commission Split</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 32%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>With the big traditional brokerages, the first thing I learned is that commission splits vary. That is, there is no transparent split. These brokerages make individual deals with agents based on how much value the agent brings to the brokerage.</p>\n<p>So, what would be my deal as a <a data-wpil-monitor-id=\"13\" href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/is-exp-realty-good-for-new-agents/\">new agent</a>? Higher than I heard was offered to other new agents in my area, probably because of my legal background and long-time local sphere of influence (meaning I know a lot of people already who might become a client). Remember, commission splits vary with these traditional brokerages.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"253\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4439 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>My split offer? At Sotheby’s and Compass, I was told I’d get a 70/30 split &#8211; that’s 70% to me and 30% to them. That seemed pretty good, as those of you watching some of those reality programs about selling real estate have probably heard that most of those agents get a 50% commission split, with the brokerage keeping 50% of their commission checks.</p>\n<p>So 70/30 seemed good. But, then I found out that there’s a huge “transaction fee” aka “franchise fee” of 6% per deal. Wait. What? Doesn’t that make my split 64/36?</p>\n<p>Anyway, the other large brokerages had various payouts, all about the same as Sotheby’s and Compass. All these traditional brokerages are clearly impacted by the high costs of their structures &#8211; physical offices and layers of franchise middlemen.</p>\n<p>The bottom line, traditional brokerages have high expenses and those must all be paid by the agents. Their commission splits need to benefit the brokerage to stay in business. Want to compare these yourself? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/traditional\">real estate brokerage comparisons</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-commission-split\">eXp Realty Commission Split</h3>\n<p>With that knowledge, I researched eXp Realty. Much easier to research because agent pay is totally transparent. Every agent gets paid the same and that is an 80/20 split to start with – so this <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/commission\">eXp commission split</a> is already better than the traditional brokerage’s commission split that I was offered.</p>\n<p>But it gets better! Once an eXp agent has paid eXp Realty just $16,000 from the 20% that eXp earns per deal, that agent then “caps” and eXp pays that agent 100% of their commission for the rest of the agent’s calendar year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:33% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"256\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4440 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This is huge! No traditional brokerage I researched had any cap for agents, so those brokerages continue to take their cut of agent commissions for every single deal an agent does.</p>\n<p>But again, at eXp, it even gets better than that. I know this is crazy! So not only does every agent get an 80/20 split that can turn into a 100% payout, but every agent also has the same opportunity to earn even more.</p>\n<p>That is, when agents meet certain requirements, they get their full amount paid to eXp – the $16,000 – back in company stock. Thereby, those agents – <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/icon-agent\">called ICON agents</a> earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/100-percent\">100% of their commissions</a> for the entire year. Wow! Really?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Are you wondering how eXp Realty can afford to do this? I was. The answer? eXp can do it because they don’t have the huge expenses of the traditional brokerage model.</p>\n<p>They don’t have the expense of physical offices (think Netflix instead of Blockbuster), and they don’t have multi-layers of franchise middlemen (usually 3 or 4 layers deep) who all need their cut of an agent’s commission. At eXp there are 2 layers of payment &#8211; eXp and the agents.</p>\n<p>Oh, and before you think, but I need an office space, let me clarify. eXp’s full staff works on the cloud in our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/exp-world\">eXp World</a> which is easy and fun to access for all agent needs. However, because eXp is a large profitable company, it wields a lot of negotiating power.</p>\n<p>Therefore, they have worked out a deal with <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/offices\">Regus shared offices</a> which are located all over the world. eXp agents can use Regus lounge spaces for free! There are 2 Regus offices by me, so I can go there, if I choose, to meet clients or just hang out if I don’t want to work from home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees-charged-to-real-estate-agents\"><strong>Fees Charged to Real Estate Agents</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4444\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-1-300x103.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-1-768x263.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>What was the next most important thing to me in deciding which brokerage to join? Fees, of course! How much would I have to pay the brokerage in fees?</p>\n<p>All the brokerages, eXp included, have small fees, like $100, $200, or $300 for various things ranging from monthly fees to having a desk in an office, to a broker reviewing agent transactions.</p>\n<p>But I got hung up on this huge difference:</p>\n<p>Both Sotheby’s and Compass said there was a $2200 upfront fee that I would need to pay as soon as I joined their brokerage. I’d owe that amount every year before I did any deals at all.</p>\n<p>What is the charge for? E&#038;O insurance coverage. That’s errors and omissions insurance, and all agents must have it.</p>\n<p>eXp charges agents for E&#038;O insurance too, but it’s much less than what traditional brokerages charge and, most importantly, it’s not paid upfront before an agent makes a single dime.</p>\n<p>Instead, eXp agents pay just <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/e-and-o\">$60 per deal that they close to cover E&#038;O charges</a>. And that caps too. I know another cap! Don’t you love it! E&#038;O insurance caps at $750 for the year, so eXp agents will never pay the $2200 that the traditional brokerages charge.</p>\n<p>The last thing about fees that I want to mention is that <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/fees\">eXp has much lower “smaller” fees</a> across the board, and also, agents get a lot more value from the brokerage for those small fees than what was available from the large traditional brokerages.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-for-new-real-estate-agents\"><strong>Training for New Real Estate Agents</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4441 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The last thing I cared about in choosing a brokerage was the available training. No traditional brokerage came close to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/training\">eXp’s training</a>.  It starts with the over 50 hours of live training every week that is available at eXp Realty. Plus, eXp has four other modes of training with on-demand training in eXp University, new agent training with the Go Curriculum, and live training of KickStart and FastCap.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>On top of that, the quality of the training is top-notch as it’s much of it is taught by currently producing top agents. It’s easy to access any training I want to attend, as they are all video calls. So, no trip to an office.</p>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://eventscalendar.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp publishes a list of what training is available</a> in the upcoming week. That allows me to choose to attend meetings with topics that challenge me and skip ones I am confident about.</p>\n<p>All the traditional brokerages had a much less organized way of agent training, or they just told me to go to a seminar, one that would cost me over $2000 to learn. I preferred the free, cool online access that eXp offers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"and-theres-more\">And, There’s More…</h2>\n<p>So yes—after all my legal sleuthing and brokerage deep dives, I landed at eXp Realty. As a lawyer and real estate agent, I knew I wasn’t signing up for just any brokerage. I wanted one that could actually back me up with the tools, training, and support to make this whole real estate gig work. But what didn’t I expect? How much more there was to the story after I joined, especially when it came to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/basics\">eXp Realty’s sponsor program</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, I’ll admit it: I got lucky. Like four times over.</p>\n<p>First lucky break? I even <em>found out</em> about eXp Realty’s sponsor structure. This isn&#8217;t some tired “team lead gets a cut” model like you see at traditional brokerages. Nope. eXp has a seven-layer sponsor support system. (Yes, seven. Like real estate inception.) It was built to reward agents for helping others grow, not just for recruiting’s sake.</p>\n<p>Second win? I learned early on that <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/find-yours\">choosing your eXp sponsor is a one-shot deal</a>. Once you name someone on your eXp application, that’s your person. No take-backs unless you leave the company for a year and come back. Yikes. So yeah, I took that part <em>very</em> seriously.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/real-estate-transaction-management-Benefits-of-Using-SkySlope.webp\" alt=\"real estate transaction management, Benefits of Using SkySlope\" class=\"wp-image-265291\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/real-estate-transaction-management-Benefits-of-Using-SkySlope.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/real-estate-transaction-management-Benefits-of-Using-SkySlope-300x68.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/real-estate-transaction-management-Benefits-of-Using-SkySlope-768x175.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Third stroke of genius (or maybe obsessive research)? I chose the Wolf Pack. Based on reviews, calls, and actual conversations with agents—not just shiny promo videos—I could tell they were different. They offer video courses, weekly live coaching, and most importantly, real community. This wasn’t just a team—it became my people.</p>\n<p>And finally, let’s talk about the fourth jackpot: <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share-2\">revenue share</a>. I didn’t even dig into that too deeply before I joined, but it turns out eXp Realty isn’t just the best when it comes to passive income—it’s the <em>only</em> brokerage that lets agents get creative about it. You can build your own brand within the model, bring agents into your group, and provide them with your own custom value stack.</p>\n<p>Which is exactly what my partner Doug Smart and I did. We launched Smart Agent Alliance, our own sponsor group within eXp Realty. Agents who name us as their sponsor don’t just get our full arsenal of passive income support, lead generation tools, templates, and training—they also get everything the Wolf Pack offers. That’s right: two powerhouse teams for the price of&#8230; free. Literally. It’s all included.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: I chose eXp Realty, I chose the Wolf Pack, and I built Smart Agent Alliance—and the value we offer is more than anyone else. It’s no wonder eXp keeps topping <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor’s best places to work</a>, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/reviews\">anonymous agent reviews</a>, and smashing growth records. As someone who left law to build something bigger, I’ve found the kind of career support most agents only dream of. And now, I get to offer that same support to others. That’s what I call a solid return on research.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-my-e-xp-realty-career-was-the-best-business-decision-ive-made\"><strong>Why My eXp Realty Career Was the Best Business Decision I’ve Made</strong></h2>\n<p>Looking back, choosing an eXp Realty career wasn’t just a smart move—it was the game-changer. Traditional brokerages made me feel like I’d be running a marathon in flip-flops: high risk, low support, and paying for the privilege. eXp, on the other hand, offered real structure, real value, and real opportunity. The transparent commission splits, capped fees, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/stock-awards\">stock awards</a>, and training that actually teaches you how to succeed? Total no-brainer. Unlike every other brokerage still clinging to outdated models, eXp Realty is the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/profits\"><em>only</em> publicly traded brokerage to stay profitable over the last five years</a>. That tells you everything you need to know about which ship is staying afloat.</p>\n<p>But the real secret weapon? Team support. By joining with the Wolf Pack and starting Smart Agent Alliance, I didn’t just get a brokerage—I got a powerhouse team that offers so much!  <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/smart-agent-alliance\">Smart Agent Alliance</a> runs meetings so you can gain <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share/\">passive income</a>.

Commission is the bread and butter of your income in this business. It&#8217;s the fee that you, as an agent, earn for your top-notch services in making those property deals happen.</p>\n<p>Now, here&#8217;s the nitty-gritty &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a percentage of the final sale price of the property. But remember, if the deal doesn&#8217;t close, there&#8217;s no commission for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"real-estate-agent-commission-mechanics\">Real Estate Agent Commission Mechanics</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how commission fees usually work: when a home gets sold, the seller typically pays the total commission due, and that goes to their trusty seller&#8217;s agent.</p>\n<p>The exact commission percentage? Well, that&#8217;s something the seller and their agent work out and put down in black and white in their contract.</p>\n<p>Now, here&#8217;s where the rubber meets the road &#8211; that contract also spells out what price the seller&#8217;s agent is willing to fork over to the buyer&#8217;s agents so that buyer agents will help them sell the home.</p>\n<p>This buyer agent&#8217;s fee is public knowledge as it is listed in the home&#8217;s MLS (Multiple Listing Service) listing. When the deal goes through and the home changes hands, the agents on both sides of the deal get paid.</p>\n<p>Quick heads up, though &#8211; keep an eye out for potential changes in these payment structures. New laws might be on the horizon, and they could shake things up. But for now, this is how the real estate agent commission game is typically played.</p>\n<h3 id=\"real-estate-agent-commission-payment-process\">Real Estate Agent Commission Payment Process</h3>\n<p>How does this whole process come together? Well, it all revolves around what we call &#8220;escrow.&#8221; Think of escrow as a secure holding area where a chunk of the payment &#8211; called the earnest money deposit &#8211; is safely stashed away until every little home sale detail is sorted out.</p>\n<p>Once the details are sorted, the balance of the sale’s price is deposited for correct distribution to the parties involved. Here&#8217;s the breakdown:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Imagine a buyer is head over heels for a house and agrees on a purchase price with the seller.</li>\n<li>The buyer’s earnest money deposit &#8211; typically 3% of the purchase price in California &#8211; gets parked in escrow while the buyer does their homework on the property and lines up the funds for the purchase.</li>\n<li>Next, the trusty escrow officer steps in and provides a statement detailing how the total purchase amount will be divvied up. That’s when real estate agent commission get subtracted from the seller&#8217;s side of the financial equation.</li>\n<li>When the details are all sorted and the entire sale is funded and recorded in government records, we say the deal &#8220;closes&#8221; and ownership of the home officially passes to the new owner. That’s when we agents get our well-deserved commission for making it all happen.</li>\n<li>Now, when it comes to agents getting that real estate agent commission money into their bank account, here&#8217;s how it usually rolls: initially, agent commissions are paid by escrow to the respective agents&#8217; brokerage firms. These firms take their slice of the commission and then dish out the agent&#8217;s cut.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"services-to-earn-real-estate-agent-commission\">Services to Earn Real Estate Agent Commission</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4325\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"418\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-2-300x125.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-2-768x321.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of what agents typically do to earn their real estate agent commission, it&#8217;s essential to recognize that agents invest their time and their own money to assist clients in buying or selling properties.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the kicker:  brokerages usually do not pay agents anything for their time and brokerages usually do not reimburse agents for their expenses. So let’s look at the typical time and expenses that agents incur to potentially earn a real estate agent commission:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Seller agents dedicate their time to guiding homeowners through the intricacies of the selling process. They offer valuable advice on prepping the home for sale, often arranging for necessary improvements or inspections.Seller agents pay out of pocket for photographers, videographers, drone shots, marketing materials, and all home advertising. Once the home is on the market, seller agents invest their time in scheduling viewings, fielding queries from potential buyers, and ultimately, hammering out deals and handling the essential paperwork.</li>\n<li>On the flip side, buyer agents invest their time in the search for suitable homes and personally accompany prospective buyers on property visits. They also take the time to educate buyers on the home-buying process, even assisting them in connecting with lenders, home inspectors, and other needed real estate vendors. Buyer agents negotiate the deal and once the deal is agreed on, the agents complete the essential paperwork and ensure seamless transactions by coordinating with seller agents, lenders, and escrow officers.</li>\n<li>Buyer and Seller Agents also must shell out money for their business operations &#8211; think licensing fees, MLS expenses, professional association dues, office space, tech gear, advertising, phone bills, and car maintenance and brokerage fees.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Again, real estate agents pour their time and money into these endeavors BEFORE they see a dime in real estate agent commission and with no guarantee that they will ever receive a commission.</p>\n<p>And, frankly, often real estate agents shell out money that is never reimbursed as it’s easy for clients to back out of deals when they have no skin in the game. Some might call “real estate agent” a risky profession.</p>\n<h2 id=\"client-perspective-on-real-estate-agent-commission-rates\">Client Perspective on Real Estate Agent Commission Rates</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4326\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-4.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"457\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-4-300x137.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-4-768x351.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you have insight into how agents invest their precious time and money, all in the hopes of eventually earning a real estate agent commission, let&#8217;s shift our focus to how clients often view the commission issue.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, both sellers and buyers tend to primarily consider what they will owe their agent, overlooking the fact that agents undertake these endeavors with no guaranteed payout &#8211; a risky proposition that, when successful, compensates for the occasions their investment pays nothing.</p>\n<p>Seller Considerations: Sellers carefully weigh commission rates. They want to maximize their proceeds from the sale, but, on the other hand, they often understand that a great agent can help them sell their home quickly and at the best price.</p>\n<p>Of course, market conditions also play into their views. If the market is flooded with homes for sale, sellers may be more satisfied with paying a reasonable real estate agent commission.</p>\n<p>Buyer Perspectives: The rules have changed for buyers and now they make a contract with their buyer agent to pay the agent a fee for the agent&#8217;s service. That agreed upon fee is generally not paid until a deal has closed. That fee will often be covered by the seller as a closing cost, but if not, buyers can pay their agents directly in escrow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"negotiating-real-estate-agent-commission-rates-with-clients\">Negotiating Real Estate Agent Commission Rates with Clients</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4327\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4-1-300x139.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4-1-768x355.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;re aware of how clients might perceive real estate agent commission rates, let&#8217;s explore what real estate agents can do to excel in negotiating their commission rates.</p>\n<p>Negotiation Skills: Real estate agents must possess exceptional negotiation skills, particularly when discussing their compensation with clients or brokers. Agents who excel in this area often have the potential to earn higher incomes.</p>\n<p>Value Proposition: The best method to excel in this real estate agent commission conversation is for agents to know what their unique value proposition is.  What do you bring to the table that other agents don’t have?  Your legal background?  Your 20 years of experience?  Your team’s record of success?  Your deep local knowledge?</p>\n<p>Agents that communicate a unique value proposition, set themselves apart from other agents, and effectively convey why they deserve their real estate agent commission rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"general-real-estate-agent-commission-rates\">General Real Estate Agent Commission Rates</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4328\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"416\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-2-300x125.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-2-768x319.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got some background information on commission rates, let&#8217;s delve into the specifics of what real estate agents can expect to earn from their total commission.</p>\n<h3 id=\"variations-in-real-estate-agent-commission-rates\">Variations in Real Estate Agent Commission Rates</h3>\n<p>The world of commission rates is diverse, but in the United States, residential commission rates are usually 2.5% to 3% of the sale price. </p>\n<p>However, real estate agent commission rates can be both higher and lower. For instance, some may opt for discounted total commission rates as low as 1% to 1.5%.  These lower rates generally come with inexperienced agents or agents who provide less service.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, some agents, with great experience and proven outcomes, may charge 3.5% to 4%. Plus sometime higher commissions come with additional services, such as the agent paying for the home staging, which is an expense typically paid for by the seller.</p>\n<h3 id=\"full-time-vs-part-time-agents\">Full-Time vs. Part-Time Agents</h3>\n<p>Another factor to consider in total real estate agent commission earned is the distinction between full-time and part-time agents. Not surprisingly, full-time agents that can dedicate all their working hours to agent tasks generally earn more income than their part-time counterparts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-countries\">Other Countries</h3>\n<p>Some countries have lower or higher averages than the U.S. For example, in some European countries, rates might be below 4% between both the buyer and seller agent, while in others they could reach up to 7%. It&#8217;s interesting to see how different places value real estate services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commission-rates-vs-brokerage-models\">Commission Rates vs Brokerage Models</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4329\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"451\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6-2-300x135.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6-2-768x346.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>As you know, brokerages take a split of the earned real estate agent commission.  This split is in exchange for the branding, resources, and tools provided by the brokerage to the agents.  Let’s start with how different brokerages tend to allocate their share of your commission. There are various models for this, but we&#8217;ll explore four main ones:</p>\n<h3 id=\"traditional-franchise-model-split\">Traditional Franchise Model Split</h3>\n<p>This model includes the most common names out there like Compass, Sotheby’s, Coldwell Banker, and ReMax.  With these large franchises, agents typically pay the highest real estate agent commission splits to their brokerage.</p>\n<p>While the exact real estate commission split varies between brokerages and even between the agents in the same local brokerage office, common split ratios include 50/50, 60/40, or 70/30, where the agent generally keeps the larger percentage and the lesser one goes to the brokerage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"small-independent-model-split\"><strong>Small Independent Model Split</strong></h3>\n<p>Small independent brokerages often arose by a few agents breaking away from a large traditional model and starting their own brokerage.  As such, real estate agent commission splits tend to follow the traditional franchise model split, but in some cases, the split may be slightly better than the large traditional model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloud-based-model-split\">Cloud-Based Model Split</h3>\n<p>The cloud-based model offers more favorable real estate agent commission splits, typically ranging from 80/20 to 100/0 minus some fees.  Additionally, some cloud-based models also have a cap.  A cap limits the amount of commission earned by the brokerage.</p>\n<p>So, for example, at eXp Realty, agents have an 80/20 split until the agent has paid eXp $16,000 from their earned commissions.  After that, the agent earns 100% of their commissions for the rest of their calendar year.  Oh, and spoiler alert, at exp Realty, there’s also a path for agents to get back the $16,000 they paid to exp back in company stock.  Crazy great for agents!</p>\n<h3 id=\"100percent-real-estate-agent-commission-brokerages\">100% Real Estate Agent Commission Brokerages</h3>\n<p>Some brokerages allow agents to retain their entire real estate commission.  There, agents pay predetermined fees to the brokerage for each transaction.  That sounds great, right?  Well maybe.  It depends on what the brokerage offers in value to the agents.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"production-teams\"><strong>Production Teams</strong></h3>\n<p>Another aspect of all the brokerage models that can significantly impact real estate agent commission is when the agent voluntarily joins a brokerage production team. These teams are found in all brokerage models.</p>\n<p>In essence, agents of production teams allocate a portion of their real estate agent commission to the team in return for various team-related benefits, such as services, leads, or collaborative partnerships.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s typical for a team to claim a commission share from the agent ranging from 25% to 50% of an agent&#8217;s commissions. Importantly, this split is exclusively deducted from the agent&#8217;s earnings and does not impact the brokerage&#8217;s share.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brokerage-value-for-agents\">Brokerage Value for Agents</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4330\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"421\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-1-300x126.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-1-768x323.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you know the various real estate agent commission splits that agents typically receive with different brokerage models, what value do various brokerage models typically provide for the agents?</p>\n<p>Understanding this value can help agents determine which brokerage model is best for them. Agents also need to reflect and understand their own needs to assess which brokerage model is best for them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"types-of-agent-support\">Types of Agent Support</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Technology support – Some brokerages provide tools like CRMs (customer relationship management) systems to streamline and organize the daily work of their agents.</li>\n<li>Websites – Some brokerages offer personalized IDX websites for their agents to market their services and provide to prospective clients to help establish agent credibility.</li>\n<li>Administrative support – Excellent support allows agents to focus their energy on selling homes rather than getting bogged down by paperwork and other tasks.</li>\n<li>Training programs – These hold substantial importance, especially for <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/is-exp-realty-good-for-new-agents/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"10\">new agents</a>. Enhanced training programs often lead to higher real estate agent commission in the long run, equipping agents with the knowledge and skills they need to excel in their roles.</li>\n<li>Networking – Being affiliated with a brokerage that boasts an extensive accessible network can open doors to more opportunities for selling properties and increasing earnings.</li>\n<li>Marketing tools – These include everything useful to agents from designing and sending postcards to having customizable marketing needs like flyers and social media posts.</li>\n<li>Leads – some brokerages have systems in place to generate leads to their agents.</li>\n<li>Mentorship opportunities – These quickly help new agents start to produce real estate agent commission</li>\n<li>Other income opportunities – Some brokerage models offer opportunities to earn an income by growing the brokerage company by encouraging other agents to join.</li>\n<li>Niche support – Some brokerages are set up to support special real estate niches like commercial sales or luxury sales.</li>\n<li>Niche Partnerships – Some brokerages offer specialized services to agents and their clients like partners that prepare homes for sale by remodeling and staging them or partners that provide all cash offers to sellers who want to avoid the complications of selling on the market.</li>\n<li>Niche Vendors – some brokerages have relationships with real estate vendors that can provide discounts for clients, vendors such as lenders, and title companies.</li>\n<li>Healthcare – Most brokerages do not offer any plans for agents but some do.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"comparing-brokerage-advantages-and-disadvantages\">Comparing Brokerage Advantages &#038; Disadvantages</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4331\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"408\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-1-300x122.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-1-768x313.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>First, let’s compare the advantages and disadvantages of large franchise models vs small independent models.  When evaluating large traditional franchise models like Compass, Sotheby’s, and Coldwell Banker against smaller independent brokerages, both frequently maintain physical office spaces for agents to work and meet clients.  Here are some differences:</p>\n<p><strong>Pros of the Large Franchise Model:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong Brand Appeal: Large franchise firms often possess compelling brand recognition that can attract clients.</li>\n<li>Extensive Training: Many of them offer comprehensive training programs, although some may require agents to cover training costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons of the Large Franchise Model:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inflexible Real Estate Agent Commission Splits &#038; Rates: Large firms are less likely to offer much room for agents to negotiate their commission.  Additionally, large firms are less likely to allow agents free reign to set their own commission rates.</li>\n<li>Less Control &#038; Flexibility: With the focus on maintaining the large brokerage’s branding, agents are limited in the choices they can make regarding their business.</li>\n<li>Impersonal Feel: Due to their size, large firms may create an impersonal environment for agents.</li>\n<li>Higher Fees: A portion of an agent’s real estate agent commission goes to the franchisor, raising what agents pay in general.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pros of the Small Independent Model:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flexible Real Estate Agent Commission Splits and Rates – </strong>Independent brokerages are more likely to have more room to negotiate agent splits and more flexibility in allowing agents to set their real estate agent commission rates.</li>\n<li><strong>Control and Flexibility:</strong> Independent firms grant agents more autonomy over their work, allowing them to set competitive rates and exercise complete control over their business practices including their own branding.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower Fees:</strong> Independents do not impose franchise fees, potentially resulting in agents paying lesser fees overall compared to the franchise model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons of the Small Independent Model:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Less-Recognized Brands:</strong> Smaller firms may have lesser-known brands, necessitating extra effort to establish trust with new clients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"franchise-and-independent-vs-cloud-based\">Franchise &#038; Independent vs Cloud-Based</h3>\n<p>Now that we’ve covered the pros and cons of large franchise brokerages versus small independent brokerages, let’s compare both of those against the cloud-based model.</p>\n<p>Cloud-based models are considered a disrupter to the old traditional models – much like how Netflix disrupted video viewing once dominated by Blockbuster. Some believe cloud-based models offer the best of both worlds and more.</p>\n<p>The primary disparity between the traditional brokerages and cloud-based models lies in the absence of physical brokerage office space.  However, there are exceptions like eXp Realty provides free agent access to Regus shared office spaces worldwide.  Still, agents in cloud-based offices may miss the easy access to having interactions with peers around the water cooler.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the primary advantage of cloud-based versus traditional models is the typical much higher real estate agent commission split that can be earned and the “cap” on how much the brokerage can earn from each agent.  Here are some more differences:</p>\n<p><strong>Pros of Cloud-Based Models:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extensive Training: Larger cloud-based models often offer more comprehensive and high-quality training compared to traditional brokerage models. Smaller cloud-based firms may vary in this aspect.</li>\n<li>Brand Appeal: Major cloud-based models boast significant and growing brand appeal, which may not be as pronounced among smaller ones.</li>\n<li>Real Estate Agent Commission Rate Flexibility: Many cloud-based models offer significant flexibility in what rate agents can charge clients providing more ways for agents to attract business.</li>\n<li>Brand Flexibility: Agents in cloud-based models have the freedom to build their personal brands.</li>\n<li>Transparent Real Estate Agent Commission Splits: While often not flexible, real estate agent commission splits in cloud-based models are transparent, more lucrative, and more equal across agents.</li>\n<li>Low Fees: These models typically have lower brokerage expenses, resulting in reduced fees for agents.</li>\n<li>Value Enhancement: Large cloud-based brokerages can leverage higher profits earned, by not maintaining offices, to innovate and enhance agents&#8217; businesses. They also wield influence in negotiating better deals with vendors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disadvantages of Cloud-Based Models:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less-Recognized Brands for Small Firms: Smaller cloud-based firms may struggle with lesser brand recognition.</li>\n<li>Not Feeling Connected: The absence of physical offices can lead to agents feeling disconnected from their colleagues.  Some cloud-based brokerages offer solutions to this disadvantage with the additional camaraderie that sponsorship teams can offer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"external-factors-affecting-real-estate-agent-commission-rates\">External Factors Affecting Real Estate Agent Commission Rates</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4332\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"362\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-1-300x109.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-1-768x278.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve explored the nuances of real estate agent commission splits and the value agents receive from brokerages, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the external factors that can significantly impact real estate agents&#8217; earning potential.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Property Value:</strong> The price of the property plays a pivotal role in an agent&#8217;s commission earnings. Higher-priced homes yield more substantial paychecks for agents. For instance, selling a $1 million property at a 3% commission results in a $30,000 commission, whereas a $500,000 property at the same rate earns $15,000.</p>\n<p>However, agents often adjust their commission rates for very high-priced homes, offering a reduced percentage due to similar effort requirements even though expenses are generally a bit higher for higher-priced homes.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Market Conditions:</strong> The health of the economy affects agent earnings. A robust economy with abundant buyers and sellers leads to more transactions and real estate agent commission.</p>\n<p>Conversely, recessions or limited buyer and seller activity often result in fewer transactions and earnings. Additionally, seasonal variations impact agent incomes.  For example, spring tends to result in more sales and higher prices.  Winter has the opposite effect.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Agent Experience:</strong> Experienced agents with years of expertise can confidently demand higher real estate agent commission rates. Conversely, newer agents may charge a lower commission rate as they establish themselves in the industry. They may also partner with experienced agents and share the commission.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Location Norms: </strong>Real estate agent commission rates vary across regions and types of locations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regional Variations:</strong> Different parts of the United States have varying average commission rates, with some states and counties consistently having higher rates.</li>\n<li><strong>Urban vs. Rural:</strong> Commission rates often differ between urban and rural areas, often reflecting demand and cost of living. Rural areas may have lower rates.</li>\n<li><strong>Coastal vs. Inland:</strong> Coastal areas tend to have higher commission rates due to limited coastal property supply. In contrast, inland states may have lower rates, with some exceptions based on local home prices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding these external factors is essential for both real estate agents and clients, as they influence commission rates and the overall economics of real estate transactions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Navigating the maze of real estate agent commission doesn&#8217;t have to be daunting.

As an agent, this is your chance to show homeowners that you&#8217;re the best real estate agent to sell their house.</p>\n<p>Remember, other real estate agents might be competing for the same listing, so you must bring your A-game to the task. Bringing your A-game entails thorough preparation for the listing presentation appointment.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll showcase your expertise, market knowledge, and dedication to achieving the seller’s real estate goals. This is your opportunity to shine and demonstrate why you are the most qualified and trustworthy agent for the job.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-steps-to-prepare-thoroughly-before-your-listing-appointment\">6 Steps to Prepare Thoroughly Before Your Listing Presentation Appointment</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4299\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/222.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"454\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/222.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/222-300x136.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/222-768x349.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Taking the time to prep for your listing appointment will determine the success or failure of your meeting. Remember, you’re likely competing for the role of listing agent. This is your chance &#8211; be prepared to outshine all other agents.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Review the current local market statistics</strong> so you can accurately describe whether it’s a buyer’s market or a seller’s market. Know what the local market trends are for average and median prices, price per square foot, days on the market, inventory, and whether homes are selling above or below list price.</li>\n<li><strong>Review the neighborhood statistics</strong> and also what properties are currently for sale in the neighborhood as well as other homes in the area that buyers will also likely be comparing to this property. These properties are your seller’s competition as buyers will likely see these too.</li>\n<li><strong>Research the seller</strong> through an online search. You may learn facts that will clue you into how you should do your presentation. You may also discover common interests or connections with the seller, which mentioned appropriately, can help foster a sense of unity and rapport.</li>\n<li><strong>Study the home’s history. </strong>Find out when the home was built, how big is it, and what were the previous sales prices. Demonstrating that you&#8217;ve done your homework will strengthen your credibility and professionalism.</li>\n<li><strong>Do a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA). </strong>A CMA involves comparing the property with nearby, similar houses to arrive at some range of likely value. Create a CMA with your local MLS tools or try our favorite tool, <a href=\"https://www.narrpr.com/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RPR</a>, which we highly recommend for this task. We love it!</li>\n<li><strong>Create a Comprehensive Pre-Listing Packet.</strong> This is a packet that you will leave with the seller. Include market statistics, neighborhood statistics including other homes for sale, the home’s CMA, information about the home selling process, your skills, what your brokerage offers, and a listing agreement. Print it all on at least 32lb paper for a professional look.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"4-rules-for-mastering-communication-and-relationship-building-during-your-listing-presentation\">4 Rules for Mastering Communication and Relationship Building During Your Listing Presentation</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4300\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/333.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"459\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/333.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/333-300x138.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/333-768x353.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Winning this listing is going to, first and foremost, start with your excellent social skills and communication skills. Practice up on skills like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Active Listening:</strong> Pay close attention to the seller&#8217;s needs, concerns, and preferences. Show that you are fully engaged in the conversation by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and asking follow-up questions to clarify their goals. Earn their trust.</li>\n<li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Understand the emotional aspect of selling a home. Acknowledge the seller&#8217;s feelings and validate their concerns. Empathizing with their situation helps build trust and rapport.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Use plain language and avoid jargon. Ensure that your explanations are easy to comprehend, especially when discussing contracts and legal terms. Look for understanding, not confusion, in the sellers’ expressions.</li>\n<li><strong>Answering Questions:</strong> Be prepared to answer all questions regarding the selling process, pricing, and potential challenges. If you don&#8217;t have an immediate answer, tell the sellers that you’ll find out and then promptly do so in your follow-up.</li>\n<li><strong>Body Language:</strong> Make the sellers comfortable by mimicking their actions. For example, if they talk quietly and slowly, do something similar. If they use their hands a lot, use your hands some too. Keep it real and not too matchy-matchy.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"8-steps-for-listing-presentation-day\">8 Steps for Listing Presentation Day</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4301\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/444.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"390\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/444.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/444-300x117.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/444-768x300.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve diligently prepared for the presentation and honed your social and communication skills. Now, it&#8217;s time to rendezvous with the client at their home.</p>\n<p>Arrive at the home at the appointed time. Don’t be late. Don’t park in their driveway (to make sure nothing from your car drips off onto their driveway and creates a problem for them). Knock on the door; introduce yourself; and exchange pleasantries. Next, go through the following steps.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while these steps are listed in a particular order, you must adapt and respond to the sellers&#8217; cues. Being flexible helps the presentation flow naturally.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-make-the-most-of-touring-the-sellers-home\">1. Make the Most of Touring the Seller’s Home</h3>\n<p>After initial pleasantries, say something like, “I’ve brought some things for us to look at but I’d love to see your home first. Would you show it to me?” This demonstrates your respect for their space and the house tour will provide valuable insights for you about the home’s unique features.</p>\n<p>The home sellers will likely say “yes” as they want to tell you about the home and they’d love to see that you like it too. As you tour each room, ask questions about what the seller loves. This provides great information and tunes you into their emotional connection to the house.</p>\n<p>Following the tour, ask where you can all sit down to discuss the selling process. Be sure to sit across from the sellers to provide easy eye contact and good presentation views for the sellers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-time-to-start-your-listing-presentation\">2. Time to Start Your Listing Presentation</h3>\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s time for the pivotal listing presentation. Take a seat with the homeowners and follow these tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Technology to Dazzle. Use laptops or tablets to present visuals that substantiate your points. This presentation along with your meticulously prepared pre-listing packet ups your professionalism and organization and further bolsters seller confidence in you.</li>\n<li>Provide a Comprehensive Outline. Let the homeowners know what your presentation is going to cover and ask them if there is anything on the list that they don’t want to discuss.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"3-leverage-your-brokerage-or-team-for-credibility\">3. Leverage your Brokerage or Team for Credibility</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4004 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-FREE-Value-Packed-Proposition.webp\" alt=\"Intense wolf eyes flanking the bold Wolf Pack logo, representing the focused vision and free value-packed proposition of eXp Realty&#039;s sponsorship team.\" width=\"493\" height=\"202\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-FREE-Value-Packed-Proposition.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-FREE-Value-Packed-Proposition-300x123.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-FREE-Value-Packed-Proposition-768x314.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" /></p>\n<p>Begin by sharing your real estate sales experience so the homeowner will gain confidence in your abilities. If you’re new with no experience, no worries, just highlight the achievements of your team or brokerage. Use statements like “we accomplished this…” or “our firm had this many sales last year”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-review-your-prepped-materials\">4. Review your Prepped Materials</h3>\n<p>Remember that pre-listing packet you prepared? Time to dive into it. Discuss the current market statistics and the neighborhood statistics. Go over the home selling process, your skills, and what your brokerage offers. Save the CMA and competing homes for sale information for a later step.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-explain-your-effective-marketing-plan-for-listings\">5. Explain Your Effective Marketing Plan for Listings</h3>\n<p>Be sure to share your awesome marketing plan for their home. Include as many of the following items as possible to shine above your competition!</p>\n<h4 id=\"utilizing-the-local-mls-to-enhance-listings\">Utilizing the Local MLS to Enhance Listings</h4>\n<p>Let the seller know that you’ll be listing their property on the <strong>Local Multiple Listing Service (MLS)</strong> and on real estate industry sites like Zillow, Realtor.com, and Redfin. Also, inform the sellers that the MLS is hands down the best way to sell a home and only licensed agents can access it. Tell them that the MLS listing will result in buyer agents scheduling house showings.</p>\n<h4 id=\"harnessing-the-potential-of-websites\">Harnessing the Potential of Websites</h4>\n<p>Offer a dedicated website, or a page on your website, for the property that showcases the home.

Explain the Essential Steps to Prepare a Home for the Market</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve completed your marketing plan, you’ll move on to information about prepping the home for sale, staging, photography, and videography. Some of these conversations will be awkward so prime your social skills to create a kind approach. Follow these tips:</p>\n<h4 id=\"making-physical-changes-to-improve-the-homes-look-and-feel\">Making Physical Changes to Improve the Home’s Look and Feel</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Engage Positively:</strong> Start the talk by highlighting the importance of making the home as appealing as possible to potential buyers. Emphasize that this preparation is like getting ready for a grand performance.</li>\n<li><strong>Address Visible Repairs:</strong> Explain that it&#8217;s crucial to begin with visible repairs and updates that immediately catch the eye. Why? Because if a buyer sees something wrong, they often assume there’s a lot more wrong that they don’t see. Mention specific examples like fixing leaky faucets, quieting squeaky doors, and attending to chipped paint.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a Spacious Feel:</strong> Suggest the idea of rearranging furniture to make rooms appear more spacious. Encourage the seller to consider removing personal items such as family photos to help buyers envision themselves living in the space.</li>\n<li><strong>Freshen Up the Look:</strong> Describe the benefits of making improvements like installing new fixtures or applying fresh paint, both in contemporary style. Mention how these enhancements rejuvenate rooms to something that today’s buyers love!</li>\n<li><strong>Introduce Fix Now, Pay Later:</strong> Is the homeowner feeling overwhelmed? If you’re with eXp Realty, introduce the concept of letting someone else handle it all with no upfront cost!From cleaning to painting, kitchen remodels, moving walls, exterior refreshes, and more, our eXp Partner does the work at a competitive price.\n<p>The best part? Homeowners don’t have to pay for the work until their home sells! And, they won’t be charged interest or any fees either during the listing period.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"maximizing-the-impact-of-home-staging-in-listings\">Maximizing the Impact of Home Staging in Listings</h4>\n<p>Next, you’ll need to educate the homeowner regarding staging. Staging a home means decorating it so buyers can imagine living there themselves. Introduce these benefits of staging:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homes that are staged sell on average 50% faster and for more money.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Staging makes spaces feel larger.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Staging helps highlight the best parts of the house.</li>\n<li>Staging makes photos look better online where most buyers start their search.</li>\n<li>Not as nice, but cost-effective, staging can also be done virtually, where the components are added to pictures of empty rooms still helping buyers visualize how to use a room.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"the-power-of-hd-photography-and-videography-in-listings\">The Power of HD Photography and Videography in Listings</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4303 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Small-Blog-Images-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Small-Blog-Images-1.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Small-Blog-Images-1-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Last, you’ll want to introduce the professional images you’ll provide:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HD Photography &#8211; The home needs <strong>HD photography</strong> so every detail shines through online listings. These photos will capture each room from its best angle, showing off space and light beautifully. Professional photographers know how to do this just right &#8211; that is why you hire and pay for them!</li>\n<li>Videography Impact &#8211; Videography takes the home up another notch! Videos give potential buyers a real-life walk-through experience without stepping foot inside. They also share a story of what life could be like in this new place – something still images can’t always convey alone. That’s why you’ll hire and pay for videography too!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"7-discuss-winning-pricing-strategies\">7. Discuss Winning Pricing Strategies</h3>\n<p>Now the most important conversation you’ll have &#8211; at what price will the home be listed? Here’s how to move through this critical and sometimes emotional discussion:</p>\n<h4 id=\"setting-realistic-expectations\"><strong>Setting Realistic Expectations:</strong></h4>\n<p>Begin by stressing the importance of a realistic listing price. Explain that homeowners often value their properties higher than potential buyers. To establish realistic expectations, provide a brief overview of the current market conditions and the state of the neighborhood.</p>\n<h4 id=\"introducing-the-comparative-market-analysis-cma\"><strong>Introducing the Comparative Market Analysis (CMA):</strong></h4>\n<p>Introduce the meticulously prepared CMA that you&#8217;ve created and introduce the other homes on the market that their home will compete with for a buyer. Emphasize that the final price will be determined by prospective buyers comparing their property to others currently available.</p>\n<p>Want to be a super agent? Plan a tour for your sellers to see every house that competes with theirs. This goes a long way to getting the homeowner to be realistic in their price expectations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"discussion-on-price\"><strong>Discussion on Price:</strong></h4>\n<p>Ask the sellers for their opinion on the home&#8217;s value. This approach provides valuable insights into the sellers&#8217; expectations. You need to know their expectations before sharing your own beliefs so that you’ll know whether they are realistic (easy to work with) or not (harder).</p>\n<h4 id=\"explaining-pricing-strategies\"><strong>Explaining Pricing Strategy:</strong></h4>\n<p>Once you have the sellers&#8217; desired price, share your strategy. Layout 3 possibilities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Discuss whether it&#8217;s advantageous to list at a lower price to potentially incite a bidding war for multiple offers leading to a swift sale at a potentially higher-than-expected price.</li>\n<li>Consider if it’s better to price the house just right for a fairly fast sale.</li>\n<li>Mention the option of pricing higher if the property is exceptionally appealing but be sure to stress the need for a periodic reevaluation, ideally within a month, to adjust the price if necessary.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"8-listing-agreement\">8. Listing Agreement</h3>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve decided on the right price, it&#8217;s time to make things official. The listing agreement is the contract between you and your sellers giving you the exclusive right to sell their home.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll ask the sellers if they would like to go over the listing agreement now to sign today. Or, you can offer as we do, that they read the listing agreement at their leisure and then you’ll contact them to answer any questions and then email them an electronic version to sign.</p>\n<h2 id=\"effective-strategies-for-following-up-after-a-listing-presentation\">Effective Strategies for Following Up After a Listing Presentation</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4027\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT.webp\" alt=\"Real Estate Professional Reflecting on Mastering ChatGPT Techniques with Laptop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"408\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT-300x122.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Reflecting-on-Your-Journey-to-Master-ChatGPT-768x313.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Congratulations on completing your listing presentation.

It&#8217;s like your audition for the lead role in their home-selling journey.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-should-i-deliver-my-listing-presentation\">How should I deliver my listing presentation?</h3>\n<p>Deliver it with confidence and clarity. Think of it as storytelling—with you guiding them through a tale where they happily sell their home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-is-explaining-my-marketing-strategy-important\">Why is explaining my marketing strategy important?</h3>\n<p>It’s crucial because sellers want to know how you’ll make their property shine in the marketplace—like revealing the secret sauce that makes a dish irresistible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-goes-into-preparing-a-home-to-list\">What goes into preparing a home to list?</h3>\n<p>A lot if you want buyers to visualize themselves in the home. Examples of changes include decluttering, repairs, and staging—the makeover that turns an everyday house into every buyer&#8217;s dream home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-discuss-winning-pricing-strategies-during-a-listing-presentation\">Can you discuss winning pricing strategies during a listing presentation?</h3>\n<p>Absolutely! It’s about hitting the sweet spot—pricing that attracts buyers without leaving money on the table. Like finding Goldilocks&#8217; &#8220;just right&#8221; porridge temperature.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-next-steps-after-a-listing-presentation\">What are the next steps after a listing presentation?</h3>\n<p>Post-presentation, it’s action time: signing agreements, setting timelines—it’s like mapping out our treasure hunt for the perfect buyer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-buyers-market\">What is a buyer’s market?</h3>\n<p>A buyer&#8217;s market in real estate refers to a market condition where there is an abundance of homes available for sale, and the number of potential buyers is relatively low. In this scenario, buyers have the upper hand as they have more choices, negotiate favorable terms, and often enjoy lower prices due to the surplus of homes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-sellers-market\">What is a seller’s market?</h3>\n<p>A seller&#8217;s market in real estate is a market condition where there is a high demand for homes, but the supply of available properties is relatively limited. In this scenario, sellers have the upper hand as they have fewer homes to choose from, which often leads to increased property prices and favorable terms for sellers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-cma\">What is a CMA?</h3>\n<p>A Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) is a method used in real estate to estimate the value of a specific property by comparing it to similar properties that have recently been sold in the same area. Real estate agents and professionals typically conduct CMAs to help sellers determine an appropriate listing price for their property or to assist buyers in making informed decisions about how much to offer for a home.</p>\n<h3>How long should a listing presentation be?</h3>\n<p>The length of a real estate listing presentation can vary, but it&#8217;s generally recommended to keep it concise and focused, typically lasting between 30 minutes to 1 hour. Don’t bore the sellers but be sure to answer all their questions.</p>\n<h3>What does listing presentation mean?</h3>\n<p>A real estate listing presentation is a formal meeting or presentation that a real estate agent conducts with a potential seller who is interested in selling their property. The agent should aim to present why they are the best agent for the job.</p>\n<h3>What to bring to a listing presentation?</h3>\n<p>Not much &#8211; car keys, cell phone, pre-listing packet, and a laptop or tablet to display information.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s all about how you talk, listen, understand, and get along with people. If chatting, making friends, and tuning into people’s emotions isn&#8217;t your thing, then being a realtor will be tricky.</p>\n<p>Your goal is to work every day with people who may want to buy a house or sell a house. Buyers and sellers will have questions and they’ll likely be emotional whether it’s nervous, scared, excited, confused or something else.</p>\n<p>Your job is to be their guide, someone they can trust and feel comfortable talking to.  You’ll need excellent social skills to pull that off. And it&#8217;s not just the people looking to buy or sell houses that you need to have excellent social skills for.</p>\n<p>You also must work with real estate agents on the other side of the deal. You’ll need make nice with that agent &#8211; be friendly while getting answers that will help your client.  If you’re inclined to be confrontational, you won’t get far in helping your client get the best deal for them.</p>\n<p>And there are even more people involved in deals, like loan officers, inspectors, and escrow officers. You will likely be interacting with all of these people and your fabulous social skills will again help your client get the best outcome.</p>\n<p>If you’re not sure where to start to brush up on having great social skills, practice listening first.  Listen twice as much as you talk. Also, ask questions so you really understand what people want. Last, keep your smile ready because a friendly face can make a huge difference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"agent-communication-skills\">Agent Communication Skills</h3>\n<p>Communication skills for real estate agents are different from social skills. Social skills are more about creating harmonious working relationships likely to create advantageous outcomes.</p>\n<p>But communication skills? They&#8217;re a whole different ball game. They&#8217;re about clarity, precision around complex issues, and sometimes, tackling awkward issues with finesse.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4278 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/communication.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/communication.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/communication-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Regarding complexity, breaking down real estate contracts into bite-sized, understandable pieces is important. That&#8217;s what you’ll need to do. At the same time, make sure your customers don&#8217;t feel overwhelmed. Instead, you want them to feel empowered and informed.</p>\n<p>Regarding awkward information, take, for example, advising a client on prepping or staging their home for sale. Let’s say that to get top dollar on the home’s sale, or sometimes just to sell the house at all, you know their house needs some changing.</p>\n<p>Whether those changes are merely removing items from a too-crowded room or making big physical changes, you’ll need awesome communication skills and some social skills too.</p>\n<p>Almost every seller loves their home as is and no one wants to hear that they must make changes to “improve” it.  So, in presenting this “your home needs changes” talk, it will matter what you say and how you say it.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve got to blend honesty with tact. It&#8217;s a skill to convey a clear message on how the changes will benefit them while leaving the sellers still believing that you love their home enough to be a great salesperson on their behalf.</p>\n<h3 id=\"negotiation-techniques-for-new-real-estate-agents\">Negotiation Techniques for New Real Estate Agents</h3>\n<p>As new agents in the real estate industry, <strong>honing your negotiation techniques</strong> is crucial. It&#8217;s about finding win-win situations. To do this, you’ll need to understand the needs and desires of the buyers and sellers and then find common ground to work with.</p>\n<p>For example, if your buyer loves a house but it&#8217;s slightly out of their budget, find out if the seller has other needs and desires that your buyer might meet to thereby create an offer where a lower price may still satisfy the seller while meeting the buyer’s budget.</p>\n<p>Never get confrontational. That will not serve the best interests of your client. Your social skills in playing nice, as well as being respectful and professional, with the opposing agent will help your client get information that can lead to a successful negotiation and a great outcome.</p>\n<p>Remember, good negotiators are patient and think before they speak. They are prepared. They know when to push forward and when to step back, all while maintaining emotional control.</p>\n<p>Don’t know where to start? We recommend the book “Never Split the Difference” by Chris Voss. It’s not about real estate, but the principles are gold.</p>\n<h3 id=\"time-management-skills-for-agents\">Time Management Skills for Agents</h3>\n<p>In real estate, juggling various tasks efficiently is a necessity, especially for new busy agents. The ability to manage time effectively is vital as you&#8217;ll find yourself swamped with diverse responsibilities and the constant need to learn new and evolving information.</p>\n<p>Start by prioritizing tasks each day—listing appointments, generating new leads, meetings you must take, and deadlines you must meet.</p>\n<p>Use tools like calendars, task organizers, or apps to keep track of everything you need to do. Try asana.com &#8211; that’s my favorite free task organizer.</p>\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget: delegating or automating are fantastic goals for real estate agents!  You can delegate with the help of a virtual assistant. <strong>Virtual assistants</strong> provide a variety of skills to help you perform a variety of tasks from editing your social media content to making cold calls for leads. Some overseas assistants can also be cost-effective even for new real estate agents.</p>\n<p>Regarding automation, a customer relationship management (CRM) tool can help. We’ll dive into CRMs in more detail below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-ways-to-get-your-first-real-estate-deal\">5 Ways to Get Your First Real Estate Deal</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4275\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, there are only five strategies to land your first deal. All five are about prospecting techniques for new real estate agents. Leads are people who may hire you to help them buy or sell property. Without leads, you won&#8217;t have deals to close. You can find dozens of strategies to get new leads. Let’s make it simple and break it down to just five.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-tapping-your-sphere-of-influence\">1. Tapping Your Sphere of Influence</h3>\n<p>People do business with those that they know, like, and trust. You already know lots of people who know, like, and trust you. These people are your personal network, your “Sphere of Influence”. You may already know someone who is looking to buy or sell real estate.</p>\n<p>You need to let your sphere know you’re a real estate agent. Craft a compelling announcement to let everyone know that you’re in the real estate business. Don’t just say “I’m in real estate, come work with me”.</p>\n<p>Instead, make your message more compelling, provide context as to why you became a real estate agent, why you are passionate about it, and what you bring to the table that&#8217;s different than other agents. That’s your unique value proposition and it sets you apart.</p>\n<p>Your unique value could be something from your past that helps potential home buyers and sellers like you worked in construction or lived in some location long enough to be an expert about it.</p>\n<p>Or your unique value could be something you offer that many agents don’t, like staging homes or more flexible commissions and agent contracts. Whatever it is, tell everyone you know about it.</p>\n<p>Prepare a proper announcement with your picture. Email everyone you know. Share it on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, and TikTok. People who already know may work with you as a new agent to support you. That happens all the time.</p>\n<p>Last, even if no deals flow immediately from your announcement, your friends, family, and connections may refer you to others. So don&#8217;t miss the opportunity to announce yourself. Don&#8217;t be shy. Your sphere can be a gold mine for leads.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-attending-networking-events-for-real-estate-leads\">2. Attending Networking Events for Real Estate Leads</h3>\n<p>This is all about making connections. Attend networking events with local startup business owners, real estate investors, or any other group that has something to do with real estate. The more people you know, the more deals you&#8217;re going to do.</p>\n<p>Plan to do one event every single week and stick to that plan. Here are some pro tips:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Going Alone is best &#8211; you’ll be more likely to talk to others if you are alone.</li>\n<li>Listen more than you speak &#8211; that way you learn what others need.</li>\n<li>Offer value &#8211; what can you do or provide that will help others accomplish their goals?</li>\n<li>Bring business cards &#8211; share them with the people you meet. They might call you when they need a real estate agent or they may refer you to others.</li>\n<li>Follow-up &#8211; after the event, don&#8217;t forget to reach out quickly! Send thank-you notes or emails that show detail the value you plan to provide…and then provide it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"3-prospecting-for-real-estate-clients\">3. Prospecting for New Clients</h3>\n<p>Prospecting means you reach out to people that you don’t know and see if they may need to buy or sell real estate. Reaching out to strangers is not easy but deals can flow fast. Again, there are many methods to prospect strangers but there are only two very effective choices.</p>\n<h4>Cold Calling</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4277 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Cold calling refers to calling people you have never met and have no connection with. But, as a new agent, don’t cold-call just anyone! Instead, call only homeowners who have listed their home as <strong>“For Sale By Owner” (FSBOs)</strong> and sellers whose previous home sale listing expired (so it didn’t sell).</p>\n<p>This is a lot better than calling random people. These two groups are people who definitely are selling their homes.</p>\n<h4>Door Knocking</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4280 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/door-knocking.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/door-knocking.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/door-knocking-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Door knocking is just like it sounds, you go around a neighborhood and knock on doors looking to strike up conversations with the homeowners. Of course, with door knocking you&#8217;ll meet lots of people who don&#8217;t want to sell their house right now but they may later.</p>\n<p>Be sure to offer people something of value. For example, you might offer to email them a free monthly newsletter about which homes sold in their neighborhood and at what price.</p>\n<p>Neighbors are almost always interested in knowing the details of homes in their own neighborhood. And, you get their email address in exchange which will help you stay in touch.</p>\n<h4>Pro prospecting tips for new real estate agents:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>You don’t have to do both cold calling and door knocking. Pick one or the other.</li>\n<li>Prepare scripts but keep it natural</li>\n<li>Be ready for “no” but stay positive</li>\n<li>Keep it short to be respectful of people’s time</li>\n<li>Commit to it &#8211; like you will door knock every single day for 3 hours a day in any weather every day for 6 months straight or you will call every FSBO or owner with an expired listing each week.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The bottom line, no one likes to prospect. But smart prospecting, like the above two strategies, can land you deals fast. Also, there is a great side benefit. That is, as you prospect, you&#8217;ll get better and better at it. That will develop your communication skills which will take you far in the industry.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-open-house-strategies-for-successful-lead-generation\">4. Open House Strategies for Successful Lead Generation</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4281 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open-house.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open-house.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/open-house-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Doing an open house refers to being the agent that sits at a home’s open house. You do not need to be the listing agent to “host” the open house. Some brokerages do require that you only host open homes for listing agents of your brokerage. Check your broker for the rules.</p>\n<p>Many busy agents with listings love to have another agent sit at their open houses. This is a huge opportunity for you to perhaps meet a person who wants to buy the house. If they are not already represented by a buyer’s agent, they may decide to hire you for the job.</p>\n<p>Also, even for people not interested in the home, you may meet others who are interested in a real estate transaction. There may be real buyers who could use a buyer’s agent. There may be neighbors who are planning to sell and have come by to see their competition.</p>\n<p>Doing open house is four open houses is yet again another way to meet potential prospects and hone your communication skills.</p>\n<p>Hosting open houses has so many benefits and intricacies that we devoted an entire blog just to that topic. You can <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/open-house-tips-for-real-estate-agents-in-2024-to-get-quality-leads/\">read it here</a>. Learn to get the most from your open house. They don’t cost much money, but they do take up your weekend. Make the most of your time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-using-social-media-to-create-a-strong-online-brand\">5. Using Social Media to Create a Strong Online Brand</h3>\n<p>Now, building an effective online presence as a realtor will help you grow. So let&#8217;s talk about social media for growing your business. Leveraging social media is clearly my favorite way to get business and it is what brought my first deal and nearly all my deals thereafter. Here are some amazing benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Attract New Clients: When people reach out to you for their real estate needs, they usually become your customers right then. You won’t have to do lots of <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/listing-presentation-tips/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"41\">presentations</a> or compete with other agents.</li>\n<li>Work Satisfaction: When people call you to help them, instead of you reaching out cold to others, you will likely meet people you enjoy working with. People call people they like and, it’s been my experience, that I like them too!</li>\n<li>Low Views: You don’t need a lot of views, subscribers, or comments to gain customers. You only need the few that are interested in buying or selling real estate.</li>\n<li>Low Expense: Doing social media doesn’t need to be expensive. Filming with your phone works great.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Being successful at social media means being consistent &#8211; at least posting every week. It can also be a huge time commitment and it does take time to pay off. In my experience, most agents start to see the fruits of their labor after roughly six months, but I’ve seen it pay off in as little as 3 months and as long as a year.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to unpack about social media and I can’t provide even the tip of the iceberg here. But, for <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/is-exp-realty-good-for-new-agents/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"9\">new agents</a> who want to join our free team at eXp Realty, we provide step-by-step training for all platforms, making it easy to find your way to lead generation through social media</p>\n<h2 id=\"long-term-success-in-real-estate\">Long-Term Success in Real Estate</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4274\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Long-Term.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Long-Term.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Long-Term-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Long-Term-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now you know the five ways to get your first deal and every deal after that. But there’s more secret sauce to being a successful real estate agent. Let’s get into that sauce.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-importance-of-a-written-business-plan-for-new-agents\">The Importance of a Written Business Plan for New Agents</h3>\n<p>Yes, we know writing a business plan can feel like a chore. But after you read these reasons why you should, we know you’ll be all over it.</p>\n<h4>Goal Setting</h4>\n<p>You need clear goals to succeed as a real estate agent. A <strong>written business plan</strong> helps you set targets and take action. It&#8217;s like having a map on your journey.</p>\n<p>Think about what you want in your <strong>real estate career</strong>. Do you aim to sell ten houses this year? Do you want to connect with fifty <strong>potential clients</strong>? It’s imperative to document your goals so you can later determine if your plan is working. So, write it down!</p>\n<h4>Strategy Planning</h4>\n<p>Next, your plan needs strategies for reaching your goals. Will you use social media, call FSBOs or expired listings, or host open houses? Will you invest upfront money toward your goals by paying for magazine ads, postcard campaigns, or targeted social media advertising? The key is to decide how you prefer to generate new leads to make your business grow.</p>\n<p>Later, after some reasonable time, you’ll evaluate whether your strategies are working. A written plan makes this evaluation process objective, clear, and useful. If your strategies aren’t providing the success you desire, increase your efforts, better your skills toward the tasks, or adopt new strategies.</p>\n<h4>Prioritizing Actions</h4>\n<p>Besides goals and strategies, be sure to prioritize the actions that are most imperative for getting real estate deals. Those are the actions that yield the greatest value. Prioritize connecting with customers and new lead generation over administrative work.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to get distracted from your goals in the real estate business. New circumstances come up every day, personal stuff too. Prioritizing your actions ensures that you’ll get the most important things done each day. Never miss what must be done today!</p>\n<h3 id=\"consistency-and-habits\">Consistency</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4279 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/consistancy.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/consistancy.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/consistancy-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Alright, let&#8217;s get into gear with your business plan. It&#8217;s all about putting that plan into consistent, daily action. Whether your goal is to reach out to a set number of prospects or make a certain number of calls, commit to it.</p>\n<p>Each day you hit those targets, mark it down as a victory. Why not reward yourself too? Maybe with a little treat or activity you enjoy. It&#8217;s crucial to shift your perspective on success. Don&#8217;t just wait for the big wins like landing a new client or closing a deal.</p>\n<p>Real estate can be challenging, and it&#8217;s the small, daily achievements that create success. By celebrating these everyday accomplishments, you keep your motivation high and your focus sharp. The big wins will follow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximizing-referrals-in-the-real-estate-industry\">Maximizing Referrals in the Real Estate Industry</h3>\n<p>One cool thing about real estate is that those that you work with might tell their friends about you, and just like that, you might get a new customer! Here are two tips to get referrals flowing.</p>\n<p>1. **Be Awesome at Your Job**. Make sure every client is super happy. When people are happy, they share that with others. So, treat each customer like they&#8217;re the most important person. Listen to them carefully, always be on time, and get back to them quickly when they need something.</p>\n<p>2. **Give Gifts for Referrals**. People love getting treats for helping out! If someone tells their friends about how great you are and it brings in a new customer, say thanks by giving them something nice like a gift card or a cheaper price on your services next time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"stay-connected\">Stay Connected</h3>\n<p>Now that you understand referrals, the key is to keep in constant touch with your network. This is what we call staying &#8220;top of mind&#8221; in real estate jargon. It means you&#8217;re the first person they think of when real estate needs pop up.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4283 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/stay-connected.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/stay-connected.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/stay-connected-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>How do you achieve this? Simple: use emails for updates, engage on social media or make quick calls just to check in. You could share fun facts about different houses or neighborhoods, or send out timely updates about the real estate market and home care tips.</p>\n<p>These small but consistent interactions are not just about being remembered; they&#8217;re about building a lasting relationship. By doing this, you ensure a steady flow of deals and referrals coming your way.</p>\n<p><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems</strong></p>\n<p>Feeling swamped with all the tasks and client interactions you’ll need to manage? CRM, which stands for Customer Relationship Management, is here to save the day! It&#8217;s a fantastic tool that streamlines your work, making you more effective and efficient.</p>\n<p>Imagine this: every interaction, every detail about your client’s needs and preferences, all neatly organized in one place. No more trying to recall your last conversation or jotting down notes in a dozen places.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s something cool for eXp Realty agents. We get access to a top-notch CRM called kvCORE, absolutely free. This CRM costs up to $5000 a year elsewhere!</p>\n<p>CRMs like kvCORE are about smart client management. You’ll be able to neatly keep track of clients and can segment them by their readiness to buy or sell, ensuring you send appropriate messages to them. Clients will say content and you’ll demonstrate your understanding of their unique needs.</p>\n<p>CRMs like kvCORE can also automate follow-ups. Think of it as having a virtual assistant who keeps you on top of mind with your clients, sending out timely reminders, birthday wishes, or even monthly newsletters &#8211; all without you lifting a finger.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s not all. kvCORE and similar CRMs offer a variety of other features, like running your personal IDX website and creating landing pages to generate more leads. It&#8217;s essential to know what your CRM offers, so you can make the most of these powerful tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"handling-recessions-in-the-real-estate-market\">Handling Recessions in the Real Estate Market</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4282 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/recession.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/recession.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/recession-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Ok, you’ve followed our advice and now your business is sailing along.

Relying solely on commissions from home sales can leave you vulnerable during a recession.</p>\n<p>Diversifying your real estate business can provide stability during economic downturns. Here are some solutions to doing just that!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exploring alternative revenue streams beyond traditional home sales:</strong> Real estate agents can expand their income sources by maintaining their real estate career and also consider providing additional services such as property management for rental homes.By taking on the responsibility of managing rental units on behalf of landlords, agents can earn steady monthly income through property management fees. This allows them to tap into a stable market segment and mitigate the impact of fluctuations in home sales.\n<p>Plus renters, often become buyers in the future, so be sure to show your agent value. Note &#8211; not all brokerages allow this. Check before you jump on it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Invest in Rental Properties:</strong> Owning rental properties can provide a consistent source of income even when home sales are slow.Conduct thorough market research and analysis before investing in rental properties to increase the chances of not only a stable income but also a profitable home sale in the future.</li>\n<li><strong>Join us at eXp Realty and Gain Revenue Share:</strong> <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp/\">Revenue share at eXp Realty</a> is no joke!

Don&#8217;t wait until you&#8217;re shipwrecked – equip yourself with the skills needed to navigate this tempestuous journey!</p>\n<h4 id=\"1-recession-requires-real-estate-agents-to-adaptquickly\">1. Adaptability</h4>\n<p>As we set sail into potentially choppy economic waters, it is crucial to swiftly adjust to shifting market dynamics. Staying well-informed about current trends, understanding evolving buyer preferences, and promptly altering strategies are vital.</p>\n<p>Effective communication with customers to explain market changes is equally important. Be prepared to discuss what you know about the changed market with your buyers and sellers to keep them adaptable to what changes are needed. Agents must adapt first to help their customers adapt next.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3-maintaining-a-positive-mindset-and-staying-motivated\">2. Mindset and Staying Motivation</h4>\n<p>Navigating the tempestuous economic conditions can be mentally taxing for real estate professionals. However, maintaining a positive outlook is paramount:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on Opportunities: Instead of dwelling on recession-related challenges, seek out emerging trends and underserved market niches.</li>\n<li>Sustaining Motivation: Define clear objectives and formulate an action plan to stay motivated even when facing adversity.</li>\n<li>Seeking Support: Connect with experienced industry peers who have successfully traversed previous economic downturns for guidance and encouragement.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"2-hard-times-require-real-estate-agents-to-be-resilient\">3. Real Estate Agent Resilience</h4>\n<p>Weathering a recession requires unwavering determination and resilience. Equip yourself with a resilient mindset by delving into resources on the resilient mindset, such as books, and educational videos, or just search “secrets of resilience” on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Also, having a motivational mantra on hand for you to automatically repeat when rain just keeps coming down can be a valuable anchor during challenging times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"change-sales-approach-to-changing-client-needs\">Change Sales Approach to Changing Client Needs</h3>\n<p>During recessions, the needs and priorities of people in the real estate market often shift. As a savvy agent, it&#8217;s crucial to adapt your sales approach accordingly. This means understanding that buyers may be more cautious and sellers may face difficulties in achieving their desired price points. To meet these changing needs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Be flexible</strong>: Offer alternative financing options or creative solutions to help each buyer navigate challenging economic times.</li>\n<li><strong>Price competitively</strong>: In a downturned market, setting realistic prices is key to attracting potential buyers.</li>\n<li><strong>Highlight long-term benefits</strong>: Emphasize the stability and growth potential of properties even during uncertain times.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"offering-more-to-differentiate-you-from-competitors\">Offering More to Differentiate Yourself from Competitors</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4225 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/44444.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/44444.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/44444-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Dig deep and figure out what extra value you can provide. From above, you’re already providing market insights, trends, and data to buyers and sellers so they make informed decisions. You’re also networking with industry professionals, so use those new connections to help provide a ray of sunshine for your customers.</p>\n<p>Refer your customers to reputable financial advisors or lenders that provide more insight and help in tough times. Also, consider adding home staging to your list of value provided or perhaps pay for a seller’s staging upfront and allow the seller to pay you back in a closed escrow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nurturing-relationships-for-repeat-business-opportunities\">Nurturing Relationships for Repeat Business Opportunities</h3>\n<p>If you’re following our blueprint for a recessionary storm, you’re already nurturing your past buyers and sellers with consistent communication, exceptional care, market insights, and the like. Remember to regularly reach out to past clients through personalized emails or phone calls to check on their well-being and offer any assistance they may need.</p>\n<p>Share relevant market updates, home improvement tips, or local events that demonstrate your commitment to their success beyond the initial transaction. Gently encourage satisfied clients to refer you to their friends, family members, or colleagues who may be needing real estate services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"staying-informed-about-market-trends\">Staying Informed About Market Trends</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4227 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/555555.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/555555.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/555555-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Staying informed about market trends is crucial for talking to buyers and sellers and adapting your strategies. Keep an eye on key economic indicators such as interest rates, unemployment rates, and GDP growth that can impact the housing market.</p>\n<p>Stay updated on local inventory levels, average days on the market, and home prices in your area to better advise your clients. Attend industry conferences, webinars, or workshops to stay abreast of new technologies and emerging trends that can give you a competitive edge by more thoroughly understanding the impact of what is happening in the real estate business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"assisting-investors-with-distressed-property-acquisitions-or-short-sales\">Assisting investors with distressed property acquisitions or short sales</h3>\n<p>During a recession, there is often an increase in distressed properties available at discounted prices. This is one area that gets bigger &#8211; be ready for it! Real estate agents can position themselves as experts in assisting investors looking to acquire these properties or navigate short-sale transactions.</p>\n<p>By understanding the intricacies of distressed property deals and having access to relevant listings and resources, agents can provide valuable guidance and support to investors while earning commissions on successful transactions. This is a must-have education course.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collaborating-with-local-businesses-on-joint-marketing-initiatives\">Collaborating with local businesses on joint marketing initiatives</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4094 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8.webp\" alt=\"Local Business Collaboration - Friendly Interaction at a Bakery Checkout as a Real Estate Networking Opportunity\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Real estate agents can maximize their visibility and reach. One effective way is to collaborate with local businesses on joint marketing initiatives. How? Partner with complementary businesses such as mortgage brokers, home stagers, or interior designers, to increase the value you bring.</p>\n<p>Provide value to local businesses by advertising their companies on your Instagram, TikTok, or Facebook. Invite these companies to come to your open houses or “lunch and learn” gatherings where they can meet new customers too. This collaborative approach benefits everyone and fosters community during the recessional time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leverage-technology-to-streamline-operations\">Leverage Technology to Streamline Operations</h3>\n<p>Technology plays a vital role in streamlining operations and reaching clients &#8211; two critical factors for surviving a recession as a real estate agent. Invest in tools (while being careful about your expenses) that automate administrative tasks, such as customer relationship management (CRM) software and internet scheduling platforms.</p>\n<p>Some brokerages, like eXp Realty, even provide tools for automation that agents haven’t accessed yet. Now’s the time. Also, use virtual tours and video walkthroughs to showcase properties to clients who may not be able to attend in-person showings.</p>\n<p>And, don’t waste your time or efforts, embrace digital marketing strategies like search engine optimization (SEO) to increase your internet visibility. That’s the way to success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-thought-a-big-overhaul-of-transitioning-to-a-digital-operation\">Final Thought &#8211; A Big Overhaul of Transitioning to a Digital Operation</h2>\n<p>Real estate agents must embrace technology to thrive in any economic climate &#8211; whether clear skies or hurricanes. With a digital operation, agents more easily become recession-proof as they reach a wider audience, and streamline processes, all while providing exceptional service.</p>\n<p>Use online marketing strategies like social media advertising with SEO search engine optimization and you can attract potential clients and establish yourself as an expert in the real estate industry.</p>\n<p>Transition by focusing on building a strong online presence through engaging content and interactive platforms. Leverage social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and TikTok.</p>\n<p>With those, you can showcase listings, share valuable insights about the real estate market, and connect with potential clients. Invest in user-friendly websites and mobile apps that make it easy for clients to browse listings and communicate with you directly.</p>\n<p>Remember &#8211; transitioning to a digital operation is not just about embracing technology; it&#8217;s about providing exceptional value and service to your customers.

That way real estate agents will attract more potential buyers. Here are some factors to consider when scheduling your open house:</p>\n<h4>Weekends Are Prime Time for Real Estate Agent Open Houses</h4>\n<p>Not surprisingly, weekends are the optimal choice as most people are free to come then. Therefore, Saturdays and Sundays tend to have higher attendance rates compared to weekdays.</p>\n<p>However, to take your open house to the next level, find out when most open homes are conducted in your area. Consider hosting your open house a bit before the other open houses in the area, or extend yours when others have closed.</p>\n<p>For example, if the “normal” time for holding open houses is 1 &#8211; 4 pm, do your open house from 12 &#8211; 3 pm or 2 &#8211; 5 pm. That way buyers who are planning to see lots of homes in a row will have more opportunities to attend your open house.</p>\n<p>By carefully selecting the right time and day for your real estate open house, you increase the chances of attracting more people and generating more real estate leads.</p>\n<h4>Research Local Events and Holidays</h4>\n<p>Before finalizing the open house date, research any local events or holidays happening nearby in the area. These can significantly impact attendance rates.</p>\n<p>For example, if there&#8217;s a major sporting event or festival occurring on a particular weekend near the area of your open house event, it might be best not to do an open house during that time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maximize-advertising-channels-for-open-houses\">Maximize Advertising Channels for Open Houses</h3>\n<p>To ensure a successful open house, it&#8217;s crucial to <strong>maximize advertising</strong>. Whether you are the listing agent or not, advertising beyond listing the open house in your local MLS can attract more potential buyers to your open house.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/real-estate-in-a-digital-age\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">93% of homebuyers</a> use the internet in their open house search so make sure the listing agent has added the open house to your local MLS. That way your open house event will pop up on sites like Zillow.</p>\n<h4>Utilize Online Platforms for Your Open House Event</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4095 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9.webp\" alt=\"Maximizing Reach on Social Media - Logos of Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok for Real Estate Content Creation\" width=\"434\" height=\"145\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9.webp 434w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-300x100.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px\" /></p>\n<p>Take advantage of the power of social media and your websites to advertise your open house. Create engaging posts or short-form videos for platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Twitter to reach a wider audience.</p>\n<p>Share attractive photos of the property along with compelling captions that highlight its unique features and, of course, make sure you are in the posts or videos too.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you’re the listing agent, create a dedicated webpage or landing page on your website where guests can find detailed information about the open house.</p>\n<h4>Send Email Invitations For Your Open House</h4>\n<p>Harness the power of email marketing by sending personalized invitations to buyers in your database as well as fellow realtors in your network. Craft compelling subject lines that grab attention and make sure to include enticing details about the open house in the body of the email.</p>\n<p>Don’t know what to say? Use ChatGPT to help you come up with a creative, fun invite. If you don’t know how to use ChatGPT, check out our other blogs.</p>\n<h4>Don’t Forget to Attract the Neighbors to Your Open House Event</h4>\n<p>Make a special neighborhood invitation flyer and mail it, drop it off on doorsteps, or door knock with it in the neighborhood. Tell neighbors that only neighbors are invited during that hour and include your business card.</p>\n<p>When they arrive at your open house, listen up! Neighbors can provide you with a wealth of information making you more of a neighborhood expert.</p>\n<p>Then you can provide that information to other guests at your open home, allowing you to provide more value and drive more conversations.</p>\n<p>Additionally, sometimes neighbors are people considering a move too. You might even pick up a seller lead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"efficient-open-house-record-keeping-with-digital-sign-in-open-house-sheets\">Efficient Open House Record Keeping with Digital Sign-In Open House Sheets</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4152 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-2.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-2-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Collecting visitor information</strong> at an open house is crucial for realtors, but keeping track of all those sign-in sheets and business cards can be a hassle. That&#8217;s where digital sign-in sheets come in handy!</p>\n<h4>Accurate Open House Data Collection Made Easy</h4>\n<p>With digital sign-in sheets, you collect guest data accurately and efficiently. Instead of relying on handwritten forms, leads can easily input their details into a secure platform. This ensures that you have the correct contact data without errors or missing fields.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, ask for each person’s name, phone number, email address, and whether they are working with an agent. For those not working with an agent, you can reach out at a later date to offer those visitors some type of value for their continued search.</p>\n<p>Other items you may want to ask include home addresses, if they plan to buy soon, months or years from now, if they are currently renting, or if they own their home. Having this data upfront will allow you to prioritize your follow-up organization.</p>\n<h4>What Digital Sign-In Should You Use For Your Open House Event</h4>\n<p>There are many options to choose from. Be sure to google it as well because it’s an ever-changing landscape. Here are some current ideas: Curb Hero, KVCore (note &#8211; KVCore is included in our $85 a month fee at eXp Realty while it costs others up to $500 per month), or Google Forms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"successful-open-house-tips-for-the-day-of-event\">Successful Open House Tips for the Day-of-Event<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4161\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tips-Title-Image.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tips-Title-Image.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tips-Title-Image-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tips-Title-Image-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><!--more--></h2>\n<p>To make your open house a <strong>HUGE success,</strong> it&#8217;s important to follow some guidelines and execute some <strong>creative ideas</strong> that will attract guests and leave a lasting impression. Here are a few suggestions to consider:</p>\n<h3 id=\"set-up-open-house-signs-to-direct-people-to-the-home-and-advertise-you\">Set Up Open House Signs to Direct People to the Home &#038; Advertise YOU</h3>\n<p>Catch the attention of potential real estate leads by placing in advance eye-catching signs strategically around the neighborhood and further away to drive the public to the home. Generally, the more open house signs you set up, the more visitors you will attract to your open house.</p>\n<p>And, make sure your open house signs include your name and phone number. These signs will help advertise your name as a local realtor to all who see it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"create-an-inviting-atmosphere-with-fresh-scents-and-proper-lighting\">Create an Inviting Atmosphere with Fresh Scents &#038; Proper Lighting</h3>\n<p>Get to the open house early and make sure all rooms smell good and are well-lit. Open up windows for fresh airflow and turn on all the house lights. Open drapes and shutters. You want a clean fresh smell and as much light as possible so guests don’t get turned off right away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-engage-with-open-house-visitors\">How to Engage with Open House Visitors</h3>\n<p>As an agent hosting an open house, engaging with guests is something you want to do to build rapport and address any questions or concerns people may have. Be approachable, friendly, and knowledgeable about the property and its surrounding area.</p>\n<p>When attendees talk, be a good listener and provide clear answers to their inquiries without overwhelming them with unnecessary jargon. Building trust through effective communication is the way to go. It can greatly influence their decision-making process and help you build rapport.</p>\n<h3 id=\"provide-property-details-and-your-personal-brand-information\">Provide Property Details and Your Personal Brand Information</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4148 alignright\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-2.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-2-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Start by providing free value immediately at the door &#8211; maybe hand each guest a map of all similar properties in the area with their price and other detailed information, or a list of the nearby schools, or other neighborhood information.</p>\n<p>Providing value right away increases the chance that open house guests will talk to you and that what you want, the chance to build rapport.</p>\n<p>Display detailed property information that is easy for open-house visitors to pick up and review on the spot or later after they’ve left. Provide personal brand handouts with your contact information, business card, and an introduction of you as a buyer’s agent.</p>\n<p>Be sure to include what unique value you bring as a real estate agent. Use a QR code with your links to your website, social media, or buyer’s guide.</p>\n<h3 id=\"offering-guided-tours-highlighting-key-features-of-the-house\">Offering Guided Tours Highlighting Key Features of the House</h3>\n<p>Engage your guests by greeting them at the door and providing a guided home tour that showcases the unique selling points of the home. Chat with guests, answer their questions, and share the knowledge you know about the neighborhood. Provide value and you will build rapport.</p>\n<h3 id=\"offer-refreshments-to-make-visitors-feel-welcome\">Offer Refreshments to Make Visitors Feel Welcome</h3>\n<p>Okay, sometimes people just don’t want to talk to real estate agents. One way to break the ice with people and make them feel more open and welcome &#8211; and perhaps more talkative &#8211; is to offer refreshments during their visit. Provide simple snacks like cookies and water.</p>\n<p>This creates a positive experience, demonstrates hospitality, and encourages visitors to stay longer exploring the property and talking to you!</p>\n<h3 id=\"conducting-interactive-activities-such-as-raffles-or-giveaways\">Conducting Interactive Activities such as Raffles or Giveaways</h3>\n<p>Spice up your open house even more by organizing interactive activities like raffles or giveaways. This adds excitement and provides more opportunities for you to chat with people there and build a rapport.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collaborating-with-local-businesses-for-your-open-house\">Collaborating with Local Businesses for Your Open House</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4094 alignleft\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8.webp\" alt=\"Local Business Collaboration - Friendly Interaction at a Bakery Checkout as a Real Estate Networking Opportunity\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Regarding those refreshments and giveaways, you don’t have to provide them yourself! They can be free for you! Collaborating with local businesses can help add value to your open house.</p>\n<p>Partner with nearby restaurants or cafes, title companies, and lenders to provide the needed refreshments and offer to display their business cards or other information.</p>\n<p>Also, collaborate with home improvement stores or interior designers to provide giveaways gift cards, or vouchers for their services. These collaborations not only enhance the overall experience of the open home but also demonstrate your commitment to supporting local businesses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"collaborate-with-other-real-estate-agents-for-a-joint-open-home\">Collaborate with Other Real Estate Agents for a Joint Open Home</h3>\n<p>Teaming up with other real estate professionals who specialize in different areas or neighborhoods can expand your network and provide valuable opportunities for joint open houses.</p>\n<p>By combining resources and sharing marketing efforts, you can attract a larger pool of leads who are interested in various property types or locations. Check with your brokerage to make sure you are allowed to host an open house with an outside agent.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exclusive-incentives-for-attendees\">Exclusive Incentives for Attendees</h3>\n<p>If you are the listing agent, offering exclusive incentives can create a sense of urgency and motivate prospective buyers to attend your open house. Consider providing discounts or upgrades for attendees who express genuine interest in the home.</p>\n<p>This could include offering reduced closing costs, covering home warranty fees, or even including certain furnishings or appliances as part of the deal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"livestreaming-the-open-house-on-social-media\">Live Streaming the Open House on Social Media</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4150\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"332\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-1-300x100.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-1-768x255.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you have learned about hosting a successful real estate open house, it&#8217;s time to take your open house to the next level.

I mean goldmine! If you want to take your real estate career to the next level gaining real estate leads, this is an essential part of your lead generation strategy.</p>\n<p>What makes getting real estate leads from LinkedIn so compelling?  Why is it a special opportunity?  There are 4 main reasons:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-not-crowded-for-real-estate-leads\">1. Not Crowded for Real Estate Leads</h3>\n<p>Right, believe it or not, LinkedIn’s power is easier to access because there are not many realtors doing it.  So it’s not a crowded space.  Yes, of course, there are loads of real estate agents on LinkedIn!</p>\n<p>However, the vast majority don’t have a clue about using the platform for marketing to its greatest potential.  Instead, you’ll discover that generating LinkedIn real estate leads just isn&#8217;t as crowded as what you&#8217;ll find on other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.  That means there is an opportunity to be had.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-different-than-other-platforms\">2. Different than Other Platforms</h3>\n<p>Of course, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok do have their merits too. They absolutely do. But unlike those other platforms that focus on entertainment, LinkedIn is all about professional networking and building business relationships.</p>\n<p>Potential clients on LinkedIn expect value propositions over entertainment. So your goal of real estate leads is more aligned with people using LinkedIn than on other platforms. That means you can get real estate leads faster.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-targeted-audience-on-linkedin\">3. Targeted Audience on LinkedIn</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of using LinkedIn is its ability to help you reach a highly targeted audience through your profile and connections. LinkedIn allows you to filter your search based on specific criteria such as location, industry, job title, profile, source, and connections.</p>\n<p>This means you can find people who fit your ideal client profile and connect with them directly. By targeting the right connections, you increase your chances of converting real estate leads into actual clients.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-linkedins-statistical-advantage\">4. LinkedIn’s Statistical Advantage</h3>\n<p>Statistics don&#8217;t lie and they reveal the true power behind getting LinkedIn real estate leads. For instance, did you know that <strong>80% of B2B</strong> (business-to-business) leads come from LinkedIn connections? Wait! What? I know, it’s huge!</p>\n<p>Also, studies show that professionals with a strong profile and connections on LinkedIn have higher incomes compared to those on other social media sites. Whoa! Cool! That helps to get higher ticket sales.</p>\n<p>Last, check out this statistic about spending money on ads for LinkedIn real estate leads.  NewCred says that its LinkedIn marketing has <strong>6 times the ROI</strong> (that means return on investment) and <strong>75% lower cost</strong> per lead compared to Google AdWords.</p>\n<p>Really?  Wow! These statistics highlight how effective LinkedIn can be in attracting high-quality real estate leads &#8211; leads that translate into real estate transactions for you! Ok, so those stats aren’t derived from the free use of LinkedIn. We’ll cover some of the paid ways at the end of this article.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"complete-your-linkedin-profile\"> <strong>Complete Your LinkedIn Profile</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"999\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Leveraging-Profile.webp\" alt=\"Two professional men and two professional women showcasing effective LinkedIn profile pictures for real estate lead generation.\" class=\"wp-image-4115\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Leveraging-Profile.webp 999w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Leveraging-Profile-300x93.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Leveraging-Profile-768x239.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" /></figure>\n<p>To begin your journey to gaining real estate leads on LinkedIn, it&#8217;s essential to fully complete your profile.  Make sure you fill out every bit of your profile from your past related resumes, to your unique value, to your website and other social media links. Be sure to showcase your expertise in the real estate industry.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-professional-headshot\">1. Professional Headshot</h3>\n<p>Your profile picture is the first impression on LinkedIn. <strong>Choose a professional headshot</strong> that shows your face clearly. Smile in the photo so you appear approachable. Make sure the photo has <strong>good lighting</strong> and high resolution.</p>\n<p>Dress as you would for an important client meeting. This shows you understand real estate professionalism.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-add-real-estate-keywords\">2.  Add Real Estate Keywords</h3>\n<p>Now add relevant keywords throughout your profile.  That will enhance searchability so that people can find you! Add keywords like “real estate agent”, “realtor”, “homebuyer”, “home seller”, and your location, like “San Francisco real estate”, etc.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-add-personal-banner\">3. Add Personal Banner</h3>\n<p>Create a visually appealing banner with all the right information.  You can do this yourself, free on <strong>canva.com,</strong> or hire someone. <strong>Fiverr.com </strong>is a good place to find freelancers.  Make sure your banner has a compelling headline that highlights your role as a realtor and showcases your expertise as a real estate agent. Make your headline pop by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-ideas-create-eye-catching-linkedin-banner-sarah-clay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">following LinkedIn’s suggestions</a>. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-description\">4. Description</h3>\n<p>Write a concise and engaging summary that showcases your experience, skills, and unique selling points. Highlight any certifications or awards you have received within the field of real estate. Include specific details about the types of properties you specialize in or the areas you serve.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-endorsements-and-recommendations\">5. Endorsements &#038; Recommendations</h3>\n<p>Request recommendations and testimonials from satisfied clients who can vouch for the quality of service you provide.  Display endorsements from colleagues or industry professionals who can validate your expertise.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-updates\">6. Updates</h3>\n<p>Regularly update your profile with current sales statistics, new certifications, and other changes that occur over time.  Most people don’t update their profile very often.  Be different!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7-add-a-button\">7. Add a Button</h3>\n<p>Add a LinkedIn Share Button to your company’s real estate website. With this button, your website users can easily share your content with their LinkedIn audience and networks. It’s free and easy to install. There are many options to create the button, one source is <strong>Sharethis.com</strong>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"content-for-realtors-to-gain-real-estate-leads\">Content for Realtors to Gain Real Estate Leads</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Compelling-Content.webp\" alt=\"Notebook with &#039;Content Strategy&#039; text next to a lightbulb and laptop, symbolizing innovative content planning for LinkedIn real estate marketing.\" class=\"wp-image-4113\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Compelling-Content.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Compelling-Content-300x148.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Compelling-Content-768x378.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Ok, now that you know why you want to use LinkedIn for real estate leads, let’s go over what your content can and should be:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Real Estate Information.</strong> Create and share a video about a specific neighborhood, market statistics, local businesses, and/or an introduction to your services.  Anything that provides value to the viewer.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Transaction Stories with images or videos.</strong>  Share your buying and selling success stories but focus on the story of how you helped your clients. Don’t just say you did the transaction, no one cares about your business. They care about the stories of obstacles overcome.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li> <strong>Recommendations &#038; Testimonials</strong>. Request recommendations and testimonials from satisfied clients who can vouch for the quality of service you provide. Make a post of it with a beautiful picture in the background.  Having other people sing your praises is best.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Trending News</strong>. If there is a real estate topic that is trending in the news, be sure to create content about that. For example, in 2022, prospective clients were very interested to hear how increasing interest rates might affect the housing market.  Now that’s creating value!</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Your Brokerage</strong>. Leverage your brokerage’s unique value. For example, eXp Realty includes Express Offers where sellers can get cash offers. That’s helpful for sellers to know.  Creating a post about that will draw out those looking to sell because the information is helpful for them.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Best Content</strong>.  This is about reviewing your content analytics to determine what content is getting more likes and views for you.  Once you know what your best content is, do more of that type of content.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-compelling-linkedin-content\">Create Compelling LinkedIn Content</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn.webp\" alt=\"Hand holding a large magnet towards LinkedIn icon and cut-out figures, illustrating the power of LinkedIn in attracting real estate leads.\" class=\"wp-image-4117\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn-300x111.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LinkedIn-768x284.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Ok, now that you know what to create, this is about how to make that content most compelling to get the most out of your efforts to get real estate leads on LinkedIn.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-engaging-posts\">1. <strong>Engaging Posts</strong></h3>\n<p>To make engaging posts, you need to craft posts that resonate with your target audience. To do that, you’ll need to understand their needs, interests, and pain points, and then you’ll tailor your content to address them directly. By doing that, you&#8217;ll capture their attention and keep them coming back for more. </p>\n<p>PRO TIP- If you don’t know your ideal prospective clients’ needs, interests, and pain points, ask <strong>ChatGPT</strong>.  And, if you don’t know how to do that, check out our blogs and videos about ChatGPT.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-visuals\">2. <strong>Visuals</strong></h3>\n<p>Use visuals, such as images or videos, to make your content more appealing. People are visual creatures, and incorporating eye-catching visuals will help grab their attention as they scroll through their feeds.</p>\n<p>For example, you can share photos of beautiful properties or create informative videos showcasing the latest real estate trends.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-engagement\">3. <strong>Engagement</strong></h3>\n<p>Encourage engagement by asking questions or prompting discussions in your posts. By initiating discussions through thought-provoking questions or inviting opinions from your audience, you&#8217;ll foster engagement and create a sense of community around your content.  We will go deeper into engagement below.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-hashtags\">4. <strong>Hashtags</strong></h3>\n<p>Include targeted hashtags related to real estate and your location of business in your posts to expand reach and attract potential clients. Try #realestate, #homebuyer, #luxuryhomes, etc…</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-quality\">5<strong>. Quality</strong></h3>\n<p>Remember that quality trumps quantity. Focus on creating high-quality posts rather than bombarding your audience with frequent but mediocre updates. Consistency is important but not at the expense of value.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"linkedin-real-estate-leads-with-engagement\"><strong>LinkedIn Real Estate Leads with Engagement</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4344\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1.png 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-300x171.png 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-768x438.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>To gain real estate leads, there is a proper way to engage. But, first, there is one overriding principle that will keep you on track &#8211; build meaningful relationships by offering value. Keep that in mind…always.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-proper-engagement\"><strong>1. Proper Engagement</strong></h3>\n<p>Let’s talk about how to properly engage with those who have engaged with you first by liking, commenting, or messaging you.  It’s time for you to build a relationship to gain a real estate lead.  Therefore, don’t ignore it when people merely “like” your content. </p>\n<p>And, don’t just say “thanks” when someone compliments your content.  Instead, plan to respond to their engagement in a meaningful and thoughtful way. </p>\n<p>To that end, start by viewing the profile and content of the person who engaged with you.  Ask them a sincere question about their work or find something to compliment them about &#8211; a genuine comment, not a fake one. </p>\n<p>Once that’s determined, comment back to them with a “thanks you for your comment and I really like the way you…” or “Thanks and I was looking at your profile and I’m wondering…”  Both approaches are thoughtful and much more likely to open further dialogue. </p>\n<p>Also, consider going the extra mile by sharing the content of others with your connections.  That is a sure way to get another person’s attention and let them know that you genuinely appreciate their work. </p>\n<p>That’s a huge compliment to other’s work without any words.  But use your words too like we already mentioned – in a meaningful and thoughtful way.</p>\n<p>Now that you’ve got the initial engagement going, keep the conversation going by stepping up your value proposition. Offer your support, insights, or resources that could benefit the connection or their audience.</p>\n<p>Here’s the key &#8211; by providing value without expecting anything in return, you establish trust and credibility. That is the way to real estate leads!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-more-engagement\"><strong>2. More Engagement</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you know how to properly engage, how can you create more of it?  Easy, reach out to your connections and start the engagement by commenting on their content.  Share some love with other people by reaching out with meaningful and thoughtful comments. </p>\n<p>That means you won’t just say “Nice post” or “Congrats”.  Instead, ask questions and make deeper comments that make it clear to your connection that you have completely read or watched their content. It takes effort. Keep your eye on the prize &#8211; real estate leads!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-increase-connections\"><strong>3. Increase Connections</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you’re engaging with your connections, you’ll want to increase your connections so that you’ll be able to engage with more people and find more real estate leads. To find more people to connect with, use Linkedin’s search bar to search for individuals and companies. </p>\n<p>You also can request connections with your network’s connections.  Do that by navigating to the profile of the person whose connections you want to view and tapping the number of connections below their profile.  Then just hit connect to anyone of interest that could result in more real estate leads.</p>\n<p>Last, LinkedIn’s premium service offers advanced search filters that allow you to narrow down your search based on various criteria such as location, industry, and job title. You can even find background information to identify potential clients.  LinkedIn’s premium service comes at a cost, but it can make this process of gaining real estate leads faster and potentially more effective.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-who-to-connect-with\"><strong>4. Who to Connect With</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you know how to increase your connections, it’s time to go over who you should request a connection from. Think about who are potential real estate leads or would have contact with other people who are real estate leads.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-real-estate-groups\"><strong>a.  Real Estate Groups</strong></h4>\n<p>Join groups relating to the real estate industry like real estate investment groups or real estate vendor groups by hitting the <strong>“Groups”</strong> button on LinkedIn’s navigation bar.  Then search for the groups by searching topics or keywords related to the group. </p>\n<p>Once found, go on to the Group&#8217;s profile page and click <strong>&#8220;Request to Join&#8221;</strong> to send a request to the Group Admins. The Group Admins reviews requests and may approve your membership.</p>\n<p>Once approved, contribute valuable insights and participate actively in discussions within the group. Share informative articles, blog posts, and industry updates.  Remember the overriding principle – build meaningful relationships by offering value!  That’s how to get real estate leads.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a group member, you can now message other group members. So, reach out to members with some proper engagement!</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-b-influential-people-businesses\"><strong>b. Influential People &#038; Businesses</strong></h4>\n<p>Connecting with local influential people and business is also great as collaborating with key players in the industry allows you to leverage each other&#8217;s networks and attract more real estate leads.</p>\n<p>Send connection requests to real estate industry people such as loan officers, escrow officers, home inspectors, title companies, local thought leaders, and industry experts.  Reach out first to individuals who have a significant number of followers and regularly share valuable content related to real estate.</p>\n<p>Once connected, explore collaboration opportunities that can help both of you including co-hosting webinars or events, contributing guest articles to each other&#8217;s blogs or newsletters, partnering up for joint marketing campaigns, or merely referring clients to each other.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-proper-connection-request\"><strong>5. Proper Connection Request</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that you know who to request a connection with, how do you do it?  Because these are people that you don’t know, take the time to introduce yourself by sending a personal message along with your request to connect. </p>\n<p>Your message needs to follow the rules of proper engagement. Avoid generic messages that do not convey that you took the time to view their profile and content. It takes time and care to get real estate leads.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6-engaging-without-connection\"><strong>6. Engaging without Connection</strong></h3>\n<p>We’ve covered how to reach out and request to connect with others so that you can begin the conversation.  However, there is also a way to begin the conversation even though you haven’t requested to connect with them or they haven’t accepted your connection request. How?</p>\n<p>With LinkedIn’s premium service, you can send <strong>InMails</strong> to anyone. InMails are like emails but they have a higher response rate compared to connection requests. That’s an advantage, but you’ll have to pay the price of LinkedIn’s premium service to get it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-steps-to-epic-linkedin-real-estate-leads\"><strong>5 Steps to EPIC LinkedIn Real Estate Leads</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4343\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2.png 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-300x171.png 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-768x438.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>This information focuses on maximizing real estate leads through LinkedIn advertising and sponsored content.  By utilizing these paid services, you can even more effectively reach your target audience and drive engagement that converts into real estate leads.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn is the champ when it comes to turning visitors into real estate leads. It boasts a 2.74% success rate of converting visitors into leads for both B2B and B2C audiences, which is way better than what you get from Facebook (0.77%) or Twitter (0.69%).</p>\n<p>Ok, let&#8217;s explore how you can maximize getting real estate leads on LinkedIn.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1-advertising\"><strong>1. Advertising</strong></h3>\n<p>Utilize LinkedIn&#8217;s advertising features to target specific demographics of potential real estate leads. That is, you can use <strong>text &#038; banner ads</strong> to promote your services and capture the attention of your target audience. </p>\n<p>You can also use LinkedIn&#8217;s advanced targeting options to narrow down your audience based on factors such as location, industry, job title, and more. Experiment with different ad formats to see which ones resonate best with your target real estate leads audience.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2-sponsored-content\"><strong>2. Sponsored Content</strong></h3>\n<p>Create compelling sponsored content that drives engagement and captures real estate leads. Craft engaging posts that provide valuable information about the real estate market or offer tips for home buyers/sellers.</p>\n<p>Include eye-catching visuals such as high-quality images or videos to grab attention. Use a clear call-to-action (CTA) in your posts, encouraging users to click, share, or provide their contact information for more details. Viola, those are real estate leads!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3-analytics\"><strong>3. Analytics</strong></h3>\n<p>Leverage LinkedIn&#8217;s analytics to track the effectiveness of your advertising campaigns. Monitor key metrics such as impressions, clicks, shares, and conversions to gauge the performance of your ads.</p>\n<p>Identify trends or patterns in user behavior to optimize future campaigns for better results toward your goal of real estate leads. Use A/B testing to compare different ad variations and determine which ones are most effective at capturing real estate leads.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4-budget-maximization\"><strong>4. Budget Maximization</strong></h3>\n<p>Make the most of your money by optimizing your ads and sponsored content based on performance data.   See what’s doing great and what’s not doing so great.  Allocate more budget towards ads consistently generating high click-through rates (CTR) or conversions.</p>\n<p>Continuously refine your targeting criteria based on data insights to ensure you&#8217;re reaching the right audience to get real estate leads. Regularly review and adjust bidding strategies to maximize your return on investment (ROI).</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5-linkedin-premium\"><strong>5. LinkedIn Premium</strong></h3>\n<p>Ok, we already touched on LinkedIn premium services &#8211; which come at a cost. However, there’s even more to LinkedIn Premium than advanced searching and the ability to message anyone. That is, LinkedIn Premium lets you know who is looking at your profile.</p>\n<p>Knowing who is looking at your profile is useful information as that LinkedIn member could be a high-quality real estate lead, someone considering doing business with you. If they are, put the wheels in motion to properly engage with them.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wrapping-it-up\">Wrapping it Up</h2>\n<p>Congratulations on completing the sections on harnessing the power of LinkedIn for <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-use-linkedin-real-estate-leads-dave-byrnes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate leads</a>!
