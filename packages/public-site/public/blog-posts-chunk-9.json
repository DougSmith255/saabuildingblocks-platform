As of May 1, 2025, the new eXp <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-launches-co-sponsor-program/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Co-Sponsorship Program</em></a> lets new agents join with not one but <em>two</em> sponsors. Yep, double the support, double the strategy.</p>\n<p>Once again, eXp is out here lapping traditional brokerages by making moves that actually benefit <em>you</em>, the agent. This new twist means you can choose both:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A powerhouse sponsor team</strong> packed with free resources and organized value</li>\n<li><strong>A local sponsor</strong> who’s boots-on-the-ground and gets your market.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The message? eXp wants agents to win. But here&#8217;s the catch &#8211; only agents who are paying attention (hi, that’s you) will even know this is a thing, let alone how to use it to their full advantage. So stick around and let’s break down how to make this work for you.

Think: free training, support systems, people who’ll spend their time and money for your success… not just your friend or someone who said, “eXp is great, you’ll love it.”</li>\n<li><strong>Co-Sponsor</strong> – This is optional and gets added <em>after</em> onboarding. You’ll likely want someone local for this &#8211; someone who knows your market, can meet up in person, or just makes the whole eXp experience feel a little more grounded. But you can also just name a friend if you’re looking to pass them some free money.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/What-Is-eXps-Co-Sponsor-Program-Really.webp\" alt=\"what is co-sponsorship at eXp?

Need help growing your production with social media? Want a sponsor with a supercharged community? Craving a team that’s already built the systems and is ready to plug you in so you can start earning passive income? Yeah, <strong>Smart Agent Alliance</strong> checks all those boxes. Just saying.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>The bottom line: eXp</strong> knows that agents who join well-organized sponsor teams are more successful and satisfied. But they also know agents still want that local connection. Now? You don’t have to choose. You can get both.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-do-e-xp-agents-want-to-be-your-sponsor\">Why do eXp Agents Want to Be Your Sponsor?</h2>\n<p>Before we go on, let’s answer the question every skeptical agent asks: “Why would another eXp agent help me &#8211; for free?” The short answer? They’re not saints &#8211; they’re smart. Thanks to the eXp Realty revenue share model, agents who bring others into the company get paid by eXp, not by you.</p>\n<p>Yep, your sponsor earns a slice of the company dollar (not your commissions), for supporting your success. So helping you isn’t just nice &#8211; it’s profitable. That’s the magic of shared revenue done right.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>By the way, if you don’t know about eXp’s revenue share model, now’s the time to check out how revenue share works and how it can earn you loads of money while at the same time setting you up with willable income that you can also keep in retirement. Ok, we know you’re not likely joining eXp because of revenue share but trust us, once you see how lucrative it can be, you’ll want in.  So, it’s time to understand it so you can make the best primary sponsor choice – it matters a lot (psst &#8211; our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share/\">Revenue Share 2.0 post</a> breaks it down without the legalese.)</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Why-do-eXp-Agents-Want-to-Be-Your-Sponsor.webp\" alt=\"Why do eXp Agents Want to Be Your Sponsor\" class=\"wp-image-268408 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Why-do-eXp-Agents-Want-to-Be-Your-Sponsor.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Why-do-eXp-Agents-Want-to-Be-Your-Sponsor-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-the-co-sponsor-program-works-for-new-e-xp-agents\">How the eXp Co-Sponsor Program Works for New eXp Agents</h2>\n<p>Before you start tossing names on your eXp sponsorship forms like darts at a board, let’s break down what you need to know about how exp sponsorship works.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sponsor-upline-red-flags-youve-been-warned\">Sponsor Upline Red Flags (You’ve Been Warned)</h3>\n<p>At eXp Realty, your sponsor line runs <em>seven levels up</em> &#8211; like a family tree, if your relatives got paid when you succeeded. But here’s the dirty little secret: some eXp sponsor uplines are more like ghost towns. Maybe you’ve got 7 levels on paper, but if 6 of them are retired, MIA, or only reply “Sounds good” to every question? You’re basically solo. That’s why choosing the <em>right</em> primary sponsor is key before you start filling out your forms.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-most-important-thing-youll-read-today\">The Most Important Thing You’ll Read Today</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Just because someone’s your eXp sponsor doesn’t mean they’re obligated to lift a finger. Being your sponsor gets them a cut of eXp&#8217;s company dollar &#8211; not your commission &#8211; but it doesn’t require them to answer a single email, text, or desperate late-night question about your first listing appointment.</p>\n<p>So ask yourself: if a sponsor isn’t offering clear value, why am I giving them free income? The best sponsors actually show up, offer support, and help you thrive. (Shocking concept, we know.)</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Most-Important-Thing-Youll-Read-Today.webp\" alt=\"The Most Important Thing You’ll Read Today\" class=\"wp-image-268406 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Most-Important-Thing-Youll-Read-Today.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Most-Important-Thing-Youll-Read-Today-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-choose-a-primary-sponsor-this-one-really-counts\">How to Choose a Primary Sponsor (This One Really Counts)</h3>\n<p>Think of your primary eXp sponsor as your golden ticket &#8211; <em>and you only get one shot at it</em>. You’ll only get access to <em>their</em> upline, not your eXp co-sponsor’s. So if you want layers of organized, actually-there-when-you-need-them humans who deliver real value (not just hype), your primary sponsor needs to be part of a serious sponsor <em>team</em> &#8211; not just a solo agent winging it.</p>\n<p>Let’s be honest: no single agent has the time, money, or systems to support you like a group of organized agents can. When you choose a sponsor team with a full value stack and strong upline, you&#8217;re setting yourself up for way more than just a welcome call.</p>\n<p>So what should you look for in a powerhouse sponsor upline? Here’s what agents say they <em>actually</em> want once they join:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A value package </strong>that they actually receive, not one that’s promised and that’s the end of it</li>\n<li><strong>A community &#8211; </strong>because everyone performs better and is happier with a sense of belonging and connection</li>\n<li><strong>Production support</strong> that provides the best of the best strategies and evolves with the market, not something stuck in 2019 tactics</li>\n<li><strong>Revenue support &#8211;</strong> the kind that builds your passive income without stealing your production hours</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/How-to-Choose-a-Primary-Sponsor-This-One-Really-Counts.webp\" alt=\"How to Choose a Primary Sponsor (This One Really Counts)\" class=\"wp-image-268405 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/How-to-Choose-a-Primary-Sponsor-This-One-Really-Counts.webp 498w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/How-to-Choose-a-Primary-Sponsor-This-One-Really-Counts-300x172.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Want a plug-and-play example? If you name <strong>Smart Agent Alliance</strong> as your primary sponsor, you get all of that. Not just hype &#8211; <em>actual</em> strategy, support, and a community that shows up.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"choosing-your-co-sponsor-bonus-round\">Choosing Your eXp Co-Sponsor (Bonus Round)</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve signed up with eXp and locked in your primary sponsor, you’ve got five days to name youreXp co-sponsor. No pressure &#8211; but don’t sleep on it either.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already have someone in mind, hit up the eXp Agent Directory. You can filter by location, reach out to local agents, and find someone who fills in the gaps. Just keep your expectations realistic &#8211; your local eXp co-sponsor is also your competition. So if you’re hoping they’ll hand over their secret lead gen playbook… yeah, probably not happening. Save those top-tier tips for your <em>primary</em> sponsor.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>And don’t forget that key difference from your primary sponsor: your <strong>co-sponsor is always just one person &#8211;</strong> you do <em>not</em> get access to your co-sponsor’s upline. That means any value they bring is entirely up to them &#8211; not a team, not a system, just <em>them</em>. So choose wisely. Look for someone who:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Has the time (and actual willingness) to support you</li>\n<li>Knows your market inside and out</li>\n<li>Does what they say they’re gonna do</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Choosing-Your-Co-Sponsor-Bonus-Round.webp\" alt=\"Choosing Your Co-Sponsor (Bonus Round)\" class=\"wp-image-268409 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Choosing-Your-Co-Sponsor-Bonus-Round.webp 498w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Choosing-Your-Co-Sponsor-Bonus-Round-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>If they can’t clearly explain what they bring to the table, that’s a red flag on fire. And, here’s the super good news &#8211; if you realize later that your co-sponsor is all talk and no follow-through, you <em>can</em> request a change. There’s a process, and you’ll need a valid reason. “They ghosted me after onboarding” might just make the cut.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"re-cap-of-the-process\">ReCap of the Process</h3>\n<p>Find an awesome sponsor team to name as your primary sponsor. Fill out your eXp application and name a founding member of that team as your sponsor (that’s Sheldon Smart for our team, aka Doug Smart).</p>\n<p>Find and name your co-sponsor within 5 days of your join date.</p>\n<p>Easy enough. Just don’t rush the choice &#8211; this is your career we’re talking about, not a group project where you do all the work.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-bigger-co-sponsorship-picture\">The Bigger Co-Sponsorship Picture</h2>\n<p>The eXp Co-Sponsor Program isn’t just a nice little perk &#8211; it’s a power move in eXp’s mission to be the most agent-focused brokerage on the planet. This is collaboration over competition. Mentorship over isolation. Long-term success over short-term burnout.</p>\n<p>By letting agents team up with <em>two</em> sponsors, eXp is doubling down on what makes it different: a revenue share model built on support, not secrecy. And the best part? You’re not stuck relying on just one person who might disappear faster than a lead after a bad listing photo.</p>\n<p>Wondering what this change looks like if you’re already an eXp agent?

Your Co-Sponsor (who you add after onboarding) is generally chosen to offer individual, usually local support.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Can agents change Primary Sponsors or Co-sponsors?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">The Co-Sponsorship Program does not allow agents to change their Primary Sponsor. However, they can request to change their co-sponsor. They must go through an approval process to ensure compliance with eXp’s policies.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Can agents &#038; advisors have multiple Co-Sponsors?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">No, an agent can only have one Co-Sponsor in addition to their Primary Sponsor.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">Is the Co-Sponsor program replacing the Mentor Program?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">No &#8211; they serve different purposes. The eXp Mentor Program is for new or inactive agents who need hands-on help with their first few deals. You’ll be paired with a certified mentor to guide you through at least three transactions and there’s required training. The Co-Sponsor Program adds potential extra support, but it doesn’t replace mentorship. However, a sponsee can choose the same person to be both their mentor and co-sponsor.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

I’m good.” Fair. But here’s the problem no one warns you about: real estate can be lonely even for agents with decades of experience. Sure, you can plan to meet up with other local eXp agents, but that takes effort.</p>\n<p><strong>You’ll soon miss what you didn’t realize you needed:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Planned weekly team meetings that keep you motivated and inspired.</li>\n<li>A family-like community where you’re seen, supported, and encouraged.</li>\n<li>A place to ask questions without feeling stupid &#8211; and get real answers.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"585\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/First-Thing-Youll-Regret-No-Weekly-Motivation-or-Support.webp\" alt=\"First Thing You’ll Regret No Weekly Motivation or Support\" class=\"wp-image-267904 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/First-Thing-Youll-Regret-No-Weekly-Motivation-or-Support.webp 585w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/First-Thing-Youll-Regret-No-Weekly-Motivation-or-Support-300x146.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Without it? You’re building a business solo. And when the inevitable slumps hit (because they will), agents without community quit or burn out way faster.</p>\n<p>At eXp, some sponsors offer thriving, built-in communities that completely change the game.  Agents who plug into these organized teams aren’t just happier – they’re the ones sticking around, driving the highest retention rates across all of eXp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"second-thing-youll-regret-missing-out-on-revenue-share-the-smart-way\">Second Thing You’ll Regret: Missing Out on Revenue Share the Smart Way</h2>\n<p>Maybe you’re thinking, “I don’t care about revenue share right now.” Totally fair. Most agents don’t when they first join.</p>\n<p>But fast forward six months &#8211; now you’re hearing about agents making $5K, $10K, even over $100K a month… and not from closings. They’re earning passive income through revenue share &#8211; just for helping others join the brokerage.</p>\n<p>That’s when it hits: <em>not</em> building a revenue share downline is the #1 regret of long-time eXp agents. Five, ten, fifteen years in &#8211; and these agents will tell you the same thing: they waited too long. They missed out. You don’t have to.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s the part no one tells you upfront:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Some sponsors actually invest time, money, and tools to help <em>you</em> grow a downline and build passive income.</li>\n<li>The best sponsors give you a full value package—so good that other agents <em>want</em> to name you as their sponsor. And the wild part? You don’t have to do the heavy lifting yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you care.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"585\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-Thing-Youll-Regret-Missing-Out-on-Revenue-Share-the-Smart-Way.webp\" alt=\"Second Thing You’ll Regret Missing Out on Revenue Share the Smart Way\" class=\"wp-image-267905 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-Thing-Youll-Regret-Missing-Out-on-Revenue-Share-the-Smart-Way.webp 585w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Second-Thing-Youll-Regret-Missing-Out-on-Revenue-Share-the-Smart-Way-300x146.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>If your sponsor doesn’t offer a crazy-good value package, good luck convincing anyone else to join you. Revenue share at eXp isn’t about “selling” people. It’s about offering such ridiculous value and support that agents WANT to be part of your group. If your sponsor doesn’t help you build that from Day 1, you’ll be stuck trying to find the money, time, and energy to piece it together yourself &#8211; while other agents race past you with built-in marketing machines.</p>\n<p>And here’s the brutal truth: once you realize you picked the wrong exp sponsor, fixing it means <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/basics/\">quitting eXp entirely</a>, sitting out for a full year, and rejoining under your better sponsor. And yes, people actually do  &#8211; the right sponsorship makes that much of a difference. It’s way easier to just choose wisely now.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bottom-line-your-sponsor-choice-shapes-everything\">Bottom Line: Your Sponsor Choice Shapes Everything</h2>\n<p>Your sponsor isn’t just a person you name once and forget about.<br />They shape whether you have a thriving career &#8211; or a lonely grind.<br />They shape whether you ever build passive income that you can retire with or will to your loved ones.<br />They shape whether you stay fired up and inspired &#8211; or burn out wondering if you made a mistake.</p>\n<p>Choosing a sponsor at eXp is choosing your business future.<br />Choose like your career depends on it.

Now imagine building it with someone who already knows where you hide the snacks and how you load the dishwasher wrong. Welcome to the wild ride of domestic real estate teams, where your coworker is also the person you share a Netflix password &#8211; and a mortgage &#8211; with.</p>\n<p>While successful real estate teams come in all shapes and sizes, real estate couple teams bring a whole new level of strategy (and occasional eye-rolls). When a married couple realtor team gets it right, they’re unstoppable: blending trust, hustle, emotional support, and just enough patience to survive both inspections and family dinners.</p>\n<p>At brokerages like eXp Realty, domestic teams even score major perks like shared commission caps &#8211; a huge bonus for couples serious about stacking wins instead of stacking arguments. (More on how Exp Realty teams make the math work later.)</p>\n<p>So, how do successful real estate agents balance a business, a marriage, and all the fun questions like <em>&#8220;How does a real estate team work?&#8221;</em> without wanting to throttle each other? And what should you be asking before joining forces (<em>or asking about Exp Realty commission splits for teams, for that matter</em>)?</p>\n<p>Let’s dive into how real estate teams &#8211; especially domestic ones &#8211; make it work (and what happens when they don’t).

Unlike traditional real estate teams where agents clock out and flee in separate directions, domestic teams (aka husband and wife teams, real estate couples, or real estate agent teams built at home) live together, work together, and, yes, probably argue about who left the lockbox in the wrong car.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/center-for-realtorr-development-podcast/working-with-teams-in-real-estate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Every successful real estate team needs defined roles</a>, but with a real estate couple, it&#8217;s even more crucial. One of you might dominate negotiations while the other shines in client care or marketing &#8211; and because you’re basically sharing a brain at this point, you spot the little things that solo agents and even big traditional real estate agent teams miss.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"493\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/What-Is-a-Domestic-Real-Estate-Team.webp\" alt=\"What Is a Domestic Real Estate Team\" class=\"wp-image-267764 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/What-Is-a-Domestic-Real-Estate-Team.webp 493w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/What-Is-a-Domestic-Real-Estate-Team-300x173.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Compared to flying solo, a husband and wife realtor team gets the bonus round: double the experience, double the skill sets, and built-in emotional backup. When you have trust, complementary strengths, and shared goals, your business isn’t just functional &#8211; it’s a freaking machine.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-e-xp-realty-couples-bonus\"><strong>The eXp Realty Couples Bonus</strong></h3>\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;re smart enough to be building your real estate team at eXp Realty, congratulations &#8211; you just unlocked one of the best perks around. Thanks to the <strong>eXp Realty team cap</strong> model, domestic teams only pay one $16,000 cap, not two. Once that’s hit, you&#8217;re rolling with 100% commission &#8211; not a typo, not a drill.</p>\n<p>What’s considered a <a href=\"https://explore.exprealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Teams-at-eXp.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">domestic team at eXp Realty</a>? All married persons or all persons who file a joint tax return.</p>\n<p>This is a <em>huge</em> advantage for any exp realty domestic team trying to maximize profits while avoiding the classic “double the fees, double the stress” trap. And while <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/commission\">exp realty commission splits</a> for teams are already generous, that shared cap structure for domestic teams turns the math seriously in your favor.</p>\n<p>Heads up, though: if you and your partner both become <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/icon-agent\">eXp ICON agents</a> (where you can earn your cap back in company stock), only <em>one</em> of you gets the official bragging rights each year. So, choose wisely, gentlemen &#8211; or start working on your “I’m just proud of us” speech.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>On top of that, with <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share/\">eXp Realty’s revenue share model</a>, one spouse can sponsor the other. It’s basically like getting paid just for being married &#8211; and way more profitable than arguing over whose turn it is to cook.

In successful real estate teams, having shared values, ambitions, and a long-term vision creates a built-in team culture that’s tough to beat. And trust us: when your real estate couple dynamic works, clients feel it &#8211; and so does your bottom line.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about the real keys to winning the game together.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"define-clear-roles-and-responsibilities\"><strong>Define Clear Roles and Responsibilities</strong></h3>\n<p>You know what kills real estate agent teams faster than a bad lead list? Overlapping roles. Couples who want to thrive need to divide and conquer like it’s a competitive sport. Successful real estate agents working as a team clearly define who’s handling lead gen, who’s nurturing client relationships, who’s <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/real-estate-agent-job/marketing/open-house-tips\">running open houses</a>, and who’s making sure the printer isn&#8217;t spitting out blank contracts again.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://blog.tomferry.com/real-estate-team-roles-and-options\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">each partner knows their lane &#8211; and stays in it</a> &#8211; the real estate business flows smoother, clients get better service, and nobody has to passive-aggressively remind anyone to update the<a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/boldtrail\"> CRM</a>.</p>\n<p>Real estate agent teams (especially domestic teams) that treat their roles seriously tend to scale faster &#8211; and fight less.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"set-shared-objectives-and-career-goals-together\"><strong>Set Shared Objectives and Career Goals Together</strong></h3>\n<p>A real estate team with no shared values or goals is like a GPS with no destination set: you’ll drive around forever and eventually throw the GPS out the window.  Shared values help form a consistent brand identity that makes clients trust you faster &#8211; and trust equals faster closings and better referrals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>Successful real estate teams (especially couple teams) check in often on the big stuff:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What does success look like to <em>both</em> of us?</li>\n<li>What kind of client experience do we promise?</li>\n<li>How do we want to show up in the market?</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"492\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Set-Shared-Objectives-and-Career-Goals-Together.webp\" alt=\"Set Shared Objectives and Career Goals Together\" class=\"wp-image-267762 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Set-Shared-Objectives-and-Career-Goals-Together.webp 492w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Set-Shared-Objectives-and-Career-Goals-Together-300x173.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Goals are important too. Whether it&#8217;s capping faster, expanding to new markets, or earning ICON agent status, goal-setting keeps both partners aligned and moving in the same direction.</p>\n<p>Pro move: Celebrate those milestones the same way you’d celebrate a big closing &#8211; and yes, that might include champagne or at least really good tacos.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"effective-communication-techniques\"><strong>Effective Communication Techniques</strong></h3>\n<p>Even if you think you communicate &#8220;pretty well,&#8221; spoiler alert: you can do better. Successful real estate couples don’t just wing it &#8211; they <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/broker-news/network/team-management-strategies-for-real-estate-brokers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">systematize communication</a> like it’s part of the business model.</p>\n<p>Set recurring meetings.

And don’t just talk about problems &#8211; celebrate wins, too.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leveraging-partnership-strengths\"><strong>Leveraging Partnership Strengths</strong></h3>\n<p>Real estate couple teams become unbeatable when they stop trying to be carbon copies of each other and start playing to their strengths. Maybe one of you is the social butterfly who charms clients, while the other is the logistics ninja who keeps contracts clean and timelines tighter than a listing price in a bidding war.</p>\n<p>By <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/broker-news/network/tips-for-couples-who-run-a-real-estate-business-together\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leveraging each other&#8217;s natural abilities</a>, real estate agent teams create smoother transactions, better client outcomes, and way less internal drama. Successful real estate teams know this: play your position, trust your partner, and build momentum together.</p>\n<p>Also, support each other&#8217;s growth. A real estate couple that learns together stays together&#8230;and makes more money doing it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-a-business-plan-that-fits-your-market-and-lifestyle\"><strong>Create a Business Plan That Fits Your Market and Lifestyle</strong></h3>\n<p>Here’s the thing: a <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/writing-a-business-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate business plan</a> isn’t optional, especially for spouses building a real estate team.

Your checklist is your passport to winning more listings.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Why-a-Checklist-is-a-Game-Changer.webp\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Why a Checklist is a Game Changer\" class=\"wp-image-267739 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Why-a-Checklist-is-a-Game-Changer.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Why-a-Checklist-is-a-Game-Changer-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-prepare-for-the-appointment\">How to Prepare for the Appointment</h2>\n<p>Winning the listing starts <em>before</em> you knock on the door. Prep like a pro, or risk looking like an amateur. Here’s how to make sure you’re locked, loaded, and ready to impress.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gather-essential-documents\">Gather Essential Documents</h3>\n<p>Nothing kills credibility faster than shuffling through your bag looking for a missing form. Plan to have your listing agreement, seller disclosures, and any required documents ready to go &#8211; neatly organized, digital or printed. Bonus points for a sleek presentation folder.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"analyze-market-comparables\">Analyze Market Comparables</h3>\n<p>Sellers want numbers, not guesswork. Do a solid Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) and plan to show them where their home stands in the market. For a step-by-step guide on creating an <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/sales-marketing/seven-steps-for-creating-a-useful-cma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">effective CMA, refer to the National Association of REALTORS®&#8217; resource</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Analyze-Market-Comparables.webp\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Analyze Market Comparables\" class=\"wp-image-267741 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Analyze-Market-Comparables.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Analyze-Market-Comparables-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>?Use recent sales, active listings, and expired listings to back up your pricing strategy. But plan to hold your final price until after you see the home and after the seller tells you what THEY think their home is worth. Then you’ll know what you’re dealing with as far as seller expectations go.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"understand-the-sellers-needs\">Understand the Seller’s Needs</h3>\n<p>Not all sellers are the same. Some want top dollar, some need a quick sale, and some just want an agent who will <em>actually</em> answer their calls. Plan to ask questions that will pull out what they want, and then tailor your approach to their priorities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"identify-communication-preferences\">Identify Communication Preferences</h3>\n<p>If you’re a great agent, you’ll be communicating frequently and regularly with your clients.  So, plan to ask how they want that communication to happen. Some clients love phone calls, others only want texts or emails. Get clear on how they prefer to communicate and respect that &#8211; it makes working together a whole lot smoother.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-a-standout-listing-presentation\">Create a Standout Listing Presentation</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Plan a listing presentation that will be clear, engaging, and to the point, and keep it short and visually appealing. Nobody wants a 45-minute PowerPoint. Bring printed materials or a slick digital version they can reference. And, hey, by the way, we at Smart Agent Alliance provide a great digital listing presentation, one that you can easily customize as your own, when you join Exp Realty and name us as your sponsor.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Create-a-Standout-Listing-Presentation.webp\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Create a Standout Listing Presentation\" class=\"wp-image-267736 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Create-a-Standout-Listing-Presentation.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Create-a-Standout-Listing-Presentation-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"running-the-appointment-like-a-pro\">Running the Appointment Like a Pro</h2>\n<p>Alright, you’re in the door. Now what?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"first-impressions-matter\">First Impressions Matter</h3>\n<p>Smile. Make eye contact. Be confident. If you fumble your introduction, you’ll spend the rest of the appointment trying to recover. So practice if you need to and, of course, be interested in their home and confident about selling it. And, remember, no one wants to hire an agent who points out all the home&#8217;s negatives. That just makes the seller think that you’re not the right agent to put the positive spin on it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"present-market-insights-like-a-boss\">Present Market Insights Like a Boss</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Sellers don’t care about <em>your</em> opinion &#8211; they care about <em>facts</em>. So, you already did your pricing homework.  Now bring charts, graphs, and data to back up your pricing recommendations. Make it visual and easy to understand. And if they hit you with the dreaded “I want to price it higher than that” objection? Show them the expired listings and explain why overpricing is the fastest way to <em>not</em> sell a house.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Present-Market-Insights-Like-a-Boss.webp\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Present Market Insights Like a Boss\" class=\"wp-image-267737 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Present-Market-Insights-Like-a-Boss.webp 498w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Present-Market-Insights-Like-a-Boss-300x172.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"handle-objections-before-they-come-up\">Handle Objections Before They Come Up</h3>\n<p>Expect objections and be ready with solid responses. If they push back on commission, break down the value you bring. If they’re hesitant to list right away, discuss market trends and timing strategies. The Mike Ferry Organization offers a <a href=\"https://assets-prod.mikeferry.com/main/files/40RealEstateObjectionsHandled.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">comprehensive list of 40 real estate objections</a> and how to handle them.</p>\n<p>The key? Stay calm, confident, and solution-focused.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"outline-your-marketing-strategy\">Outline Your Marketing Strategy</h3>\n<p>Here’s where you show them why <em>you</em> are the best agent for the job. Explain your marketing plan &#8211; professional photos, social media ads, virtual tours, open houses. Show them real examples of how you market homes. For inspiration, explore these <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-plan/real-estate-marketing-plan-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate marketing plan examples</a> from industry leaders.</p>\n<p>If another agent is promising the world, remind them that flashy talk is easy; <em>proven</em> results are what matter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"practicing-and-role-playing\">Practicing and Role-Playing</h2>\n<p>Hey, if you don’t feel like you&#8217;re ready to conquer the appointment, even the best agents practice. If you haven’t role-played a listing appointment before, now’s the time.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-role-playing-works\">Why Role-Playing Works</h3>\n<p>Ever heard of muscle memory? Practicing responses to objections makes them second nature. That way, when a seller asks a tough question, you won’t freeze up – instead, you’ll deliver a smooth, confident response.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"be-ready-for-common-objections\">Be Ready for Common Objections</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The Seller says, “I think my home is worth more.” You say, “I totally understand, and I want to get you the best price possible. Let’s look at what buyers are actually paying in your area so we can price it right and get it sold fast.”  Or the seller says, “Another agent said they’d do it for a lower commission.”  You say: “That’s great! But do they offer the same level of marketing and negotiation expertise? The right agent makes you more money, not just saves you a little upfront.”</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Be-Ready-for-Common-Objections.webp\" alt=\"Listing Checklist, Be Ready for Common Objections\" class=\"wp-image-267742 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Be-Ready-for-Common-Objections.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Listing-Checklist-Be-Ready-for-Common-Objections-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nail-the-tough-questions\">Nail the Tough Questions</h3>\n<p>If you can answer these questions without hesitation, you’re in good shape:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What makes you different from other agents?</li>\n<li>How will you market my home?</li>\n<li>What happens if my home doesn’t sell?</li>\n<li>Why should I list with you today?  So, work on your answers to those!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Spend some serious time determining what your answers will be to those questions.  That way, you won’t be caught off guard and instead will come off as the polished, experienced, professional that you are.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"follow-up-after-the-appointment\">Follow Up After the Appointment</h2>\n<p>Okay, the appointment is over.

Or maybe you just want more connection in between the big shows? That’s where eXp regional rallies come in.</p>\n<p>These localized events offer a more intimate way for agents to plug into eXp’s culture without hopping on a cross-country flight. Whether it’s in Portland, Phoenix, or Peoria, regional events bring the energy of EXPCON to your backyard—minus the long buffet lines and badge scanners.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re a key part of how eXp Realty fosters connection, learning, and collaboration on a hyper-local level. And yes, they’re still packed with value, insight, and people who get what it’s like to chase down appraisers and explain escrow in the same breath.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"whats-the-point-of-these-regional-events\">What’s the Point of These Regional Events?</h3>\n<p>Simple: to build real community and offer boots-on-the-ground support where agents live and work.</p>\n<p>eXp regional rallies give agents a space to trade market-specific tactics with people who understand their local pain points. Think less “generic real estate hype,” and more “here’s how I’m closing listings in this exact zip code.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 33%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>You’ll get:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Networking with agents you might actually see again (hello, referral network!)</li>\n<li>Training that’s tailored to your region’s quirks, competition, and client base</li>\n<li>Workshops led by agents who have actually <em>been there, done that</em>—and have the market share to prove it</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Point-of-These-Regional-Events.webp\" alt=\"What’s the Point of These Regional Events\" class=\"wp-image-267578 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Point-of-These-Regional-Events.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Point-of-These-Regional-Events-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Whether it’s pricing strategy for high desert homes or creative ways to market fixer-uppers during a rainy season, these regional convos are pure gold for real estate pros navigating their niche markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-regional-events-matter-even-if-you-go-to-e-xpcon\">Why Regional Events Matter (Even If You Go to eXpcon)</h3>\n<p>eXp regional events are more than just filler—they’re the connective tissue between the big ideas at EXPCON and your day-to-day grind.

You’ll still meet powerhouse agents and industry leaders, but you’ll also get face time with nearby colleagues who understand your market and speak your language.</p>\n<p>And that’s not just warm fuzzies—it’s referral-building, co-marketing potential, and real-deal support from people who want to see you win.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sponsor-team-meetups-like-a-family-reunion-but-with-less-potato-salad\">Sponsor Team Meetups: Like a Family Reunion, But With Less Potato Salad</h2>\n<p>Here’s the thing about eXp Realty—it’s massive. Like, <em>“real estate agents on five continents”</em> is massive. But just like a big university splits into smaller clubs, sororities, or fantasy football leagues, eXp agents often find their home base in a sponsor team.</p>\n<p>And that’s where sponsor events come in.</p>\n<p>Some of the more organized sponsor groups—like Smart Agent Alliance—host their own in-person meetups to bring their agents together. These aren’t official eXp Realty events, but they’re one of the best-kept secrets of life at eXp. You get the global support of a top online real estate brokerage <em>and</em> the cozy camaraderie of a tight-knit team.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-at-sponsor-events\">What Happens at Sponsor Events?</h3>\n<p>Honestly? It depends on the group. Some do structured training sessions that go deeper than what you’ll find in eXp World. Others keep it casual—think hiking, dinners, coworking days, or just grabbing a drink with people who <em>actually</em> get your pain when a client ghost-texts you mid-contingency.</p>\n<p>Teams like Smart Agent Alliance already meet on Zoom every week, so when we show up in person, it’s less “awkward handshake” and more “hug your accountability partner and swap listing war stories.”</p>\n<p>These events are designed to:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Build friendships that don’t feel like networking</li>\n<li>Strengthen your referral connections inside the team</li>\n<li>Learn, laugh, and maybe even vent a little with people who <em>get it</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"not-every-sponsor-does-this-but-the-good-ones-do\">Not Every Sponsor Does This—But the Good Ones Do</h3>\n<p>Let’s be real: most sponsors at eXp don’t organize local events or offer ongoing team connection. They bring you in… and then it’s radio silence.</p>\n<p>But a few sponsor teams treat this like a real commitment. They offer weekly masterminds, agent training, and occasional in-person meetups to make sure their agents are supported <em>beyond</em> the onboarding checklist.</p>\n<p>So if you’re at one of those special teams? These sponsor meetups are your people-powered bonus. And if you&#8217;re not? It might be time to ask yourself if your “team” is just a name on paper.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"local-agent-meetups-because-zoom-friends-are-even-better-in-real-life\">Local Agent Meetups: Because Zoom Friends Are Even Better in Real Life</h2>\n<p>At eXp Realty, agents are everywhere—literally everywhere. But that doesn’t mean they’re working in silos. Thanks to the company&#8217;s “we’re-in-this-together” culture, many eXp agents take it upon themselves to create local connections, with or without a formal event invite.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Local-Agent-Meetups-Because-Zoom-Friends-Are-Even-Better-in-Real-Life.webp\" alt=\"Local Agent Meetups Because Zoom Friends Are Even Better in Real Life\" class=\"wp-image-267581 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Local-Agent-Meetups-Because-Zoom-Friends-Are-Even-Better-in-Real-Life.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Local-Agent-Meetups-Because-Zoom-Friends-Are-Even-Better-in-Real-Life-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>These real estate agent networking events might be as simple as coffee with colleagues or as organized as a standing monthly meetup. Some groups even host weekly Zoom calls, so by the time you meet face-to-face, you already know who loves scripts and who’s always multitasking with their mic off.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-do-agents-bother\">Why Do Agents Bother?</h3>\n<p>Simple: eXp Realty’s culture is built for collaboration, not competition. That tagline about being “the most agent-centric brokerage on the planet”? It’s not just marketing fluff. When your brokerage actively encourages sharing, growth, and cross-market teamwork, local meetups happen organically.</p>\n<p><strong>Agents gather to:</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Swap strategies, templates, and war stories</li>\n<li>Roleplay scripts or talk through tricky transactions</li>\n<li>Celebrate wins (and survive the occasional appraisal fail)</li>\n<li>Get that sense of team camaraderie—minus the office drama</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes these local events pop up around eXpcon or a regional rally, giving agents a chance to debrief, decompress, and dream big together. Other times, it’s just a Thursday coffee catch-up where someone casually drops a million-dollar idea.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"no-stage-no-sponsors-no-pressure\">No Stage, No Sponsors, No Pressure</h3>\n<p>What makes these local meetups special is that they’re grassroots. There’s no PowerPoint, and no guest speaker has flown in from corporate. It’s agents supporting agents. And in a virtual real estate brokerage, that kind of IRL connection can make a huge difference.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking for tactical advice, referral partners, or just some humans who understand the chaos of back-to-back showings, local agent meetups give you a place to plug in.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-e-xp-realty-events-and-smart-agent-alliance-take-collaboration-to-the-next-level\">How eXp Realty Events (and Smart Agent Alliance) Take Collaboration to the Next Level</h2>\n<p>Whether it’s the massive energy of EXPCON, the hands-on vibe of a regional rally, the team bonding at sponsor events, or the grassroots charm of local agent meetups, one thing is clear: eXp Realty events are built around connection. And not the fake, handshake-and-a-business-card kind. Real, collaborative, career-boosting connection.</p>\n<p>This kind of support doesn’t happen by accident. It’s baked into the eXp Realty culture, aligning with the professional standards upheld by the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Association of REALTORS</a>.  Yep, eXp is an open-book, team-first, idea-sharing environment where agents actually <em>want</em> to help each other succeed. That’s rare. And it’s why agents stick around.</p>\n<p>At Smart Agent Alliance, we take that collaborative spirit even further. As part of our sponsor team, you’re not just signing up for a brokerage—you’re joining a support system.

Basically, some companies like Compass want them, love them, and heavily promote their usage to their clients.  However, Zillow, eXp Realty, and other real estate industry companies are taking a stand against these listings. Before we dig into why that is, let’s get clear about the primary types of listings.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"498\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Issue.webp\" alt=\"What’s the Issue\" class=\"wp-image-267599 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Issue.webp 498w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Whats-the-Issue-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exclusive-private-listings\">Exclusive Private Listings</h3>\n<p>These live deep in the “If You Know, You Know” category. These off-market listings are only visible to the listing brokerage. No MLS. No yard sign. No Zillow. No other brokerages.  These listings are needed by some sellers for their privacy or safety.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coming-soon-listings\">Coming Soon Listings</h3>\n<p>These are like teaser trailers. Technically, Coming Soon homes are on the MLS, but they are not yet live for showings. Maybe the staging isn’t done, the dog’s still shedding all over the guest room, or hammers are still banging on the upgrades.  Coming soon listings are great for agents and their clients because they create a “heads up” to all brokerages and all agents so they know what’s coming soon to the market, giving everyone more time to prepare for their desired action.</p>\n<p>But whether these “Coming Soon” listings show up immediately on Zillow depends on the local MLSs.  For example, in Marin County, CA, “Coming Soon” homes are not released to Zillow until the listing goes “active,” &#8211; which could be up to 30 days.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"active-mls-listings\">Active MLS Listings</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"499\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Off-Market-Home-Sales-Active-MLS-Listings.webp\" alt=\"Off Market Home Sales, Active MLS Listings\" class=\"wp-image-267596 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Off-Market-Home-Sales-Active-MLS-Listings.webp 499w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Off-Market-Home-Sales-Active-MLS-Listings-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Which brings us to Active Listings. They’re what most of us are here to do: get listings maximum exposure, get the best terms, and actually close deals. They’re the opposite of off-market listings—they’re visible to everyone, even  Zillow’s 3 a.m. scroll crowd.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exclusive-delayed-listings\">Exclusive “Delayed Listings”</h3>\n<p>And herein lies the center of the new real estate industry struggle.  These exclusive delayed listings have big “test balloon” energy.  They’re basically a “soft” open where the listing gets shown to the brokerage’s private network of agents and clients before going public. Brokerages like Compass push this strategy hard. Called <a href=\"https://www.compass.com/private-exclusives/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">private exclusives</a>, they pitch it like it helps sellers test pricing or build buzz without the ding of MLS days on market or price drops.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-truth-about-on-exclusive-delayed-listings\">The Truth about Exclusive Delayed Listings</h2>\n<p>So, are exclusive delayed listings good for consumers?  For that answer, we can tap into a wealth of studies regarding exclusive listings. Let&#8217;s unpack the realities.?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"off-market-homes-often-sell-for-less\">Off-Market Homes Often Sell for Less</h3>\n<p>Research indicates that “<a href=\"https://cdn.bfldr.com/BI7DUWTF/at/tgpgnx62k9gs45963k24tg/Bright-Research-MLS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">office exclusives offer no price advantage</a>s over immediately promoting a home through the MLS”.  According to new <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/mls-pln-sale-price-34846/?fbclid=IwY2xjawIkYpFleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHbppzmcr7MH4uhTLPDt_BjFVElve1c_Mf3pLktqO3c_oE40rG3nn7jb14g_aem_c55ua33LyWDKlPuAUWdh9g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zillow research</a>, private home sales don&#8217;t necessarily equate to higher profits for sellers. In fact, homes sold off the MLS fetched nearly $5,000 less on average than those listed publicly. In California, that median loss jumped to over $30,000. Ouch.?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"longer-time-on-market\">Longer Time on Market</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Patience might be a virtue, but in real estate, time is money.

The temptation to prioritize personal gain over client interest becomes a real concern, potentially compromising the fiduciary duty owed to clients.?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-some-brokerages-are-obsessed-with-off-market-listings\">Why Some Brokerages Are Obsessed with Off-Market Listings</h2>\n<p>So if exclusive listings aren’t great for clients or consumers in general, why are some brokerages pushing exclusive delayed listings like it’s the smartest thing ever? The real reasons? Money. Control. And did we mention money?</p>\n<p>Here’s how the math works out in the exclusive delayed listings brokerage’s favor:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"double-dipping-commissions\">Double-Dipping Commissions</h3>\n<p>When a listing stays off the MLS and a home sells, that brokerage gets the commission from the seller and from the buyer. That’s double the commission, half the objections, and no outside brokerage cutting into the profits. Great for the brokerage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"recruiting-hook\">Recruiting Hook</h3>\n<p>Brokerages can use these private listings as a way to entice agents to join them.  They say “Hey, we’ve got off market listings you won’t find anywhere else.”  That talk gives agents the illusion of exclusivity—even when it’s just a private home sale pulled from a shared internal folder.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lead-hoarding\">Lead Hoarding</h3>\n<p>Brokerages can also get plenty of new buyer leads from these listings.  That is, if a listing doesn’t hit the MLS or Zillow, that brokerage controls every single buyer lead. They collect emails, phone numbers, and future business off the backs of their private listings.</p>\n<p>In the end, while off-market listings might offer a cloak of exclusivity, they&#8217;re all about increasing brokerage profits.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profit-needs\">Brokerage Profit Needs</h3>\n<p>And, don’t get us wrong…a lot of brokerages seriously need these extra profits. For example, take Compass, which has rebranded these exclusive delayed listings into a full-blown strategy, pitching them as a “sophisticated” way to test the market. Spoiler: it may be less strategy and more of a survival tactic.</p>\n<p>That’s because Compass, a publicly traded brokerage, has never had a profitable quarter. Not one.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"718\" height=\"409\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.png\" alt=\"Compass Earnings History\" class=\"wp-image-267590\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.png 718w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-300x171.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px\" /></figure>\n<p>On the flip side? eXp Realty is the ONLY profitable brokerage in the past 5 years among all publicly-traded brokerages.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"732\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1.png\" alt=\"eXp World Holdings Earnings History\" class=\"wp-image-267591\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1.png 732w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1-300x176.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" /></figure>\n<p>Which might leave you thinking that Compass isn’t alone in being unprofitable.  That’s true, except Compass is dead last among all of them, and it’s not pretty.

Platforms like Zillow make money by aggregating listings, putting them in front of buyers, and cashing in when someone clicks “Request a Tour.” That lead goes straight to a real estate agent who pays Zillow for the privilege. No listing? No lead.

While other brokerages stayed quiet, eXp took action to protect sellers by ensuring they fully understand the risks of going off-market.</p>\n<p>For years, many exclusive listings slipped through without confirming whether the seller actually understood the downsides. eXp changed that. With an <a href=\"https://cdn.bfldr.com/BI7DUWTF/at/s666742zf7ghjjg2mgqn9hc/Seller-Advisory-Risks-of-Limited-Market-Exposure-FORM-Version_R_USA_EN_04102025-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp exclusive advisory</a>, every seller considering a private listing with an eXp agent must acknowledge those risks, and in a show of leadership, eXp made their exclusive listing seller advisory publicly available to all brokerages, large or small.</p>\n<p>But they didn’t stop there. eXp has officially banned “delayed exclusive listings” across the board. If you’re an eXp agent, you play by the new rules—no exceptions.</p>\n<p>For those rare cases where confidentiality is critical, sellers still have a path.

Here’s what you need to know so you’re not caught flat-footed.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wont-zillow-ban-coming-soon-listings-that-are-delayed\">“Won’t Zillow Ban Coming Soon Listings That Are Delayed?”</h3>\n<p>Nope. Coming Soon listings aren’t the same as private exclusives. They’re fully MLS-sanctioned and visible to all agents and clients across brokerages. Think of them as a heads-up to the market—“Hey market, this home’s almost ready—hang tight.”  . <a href=\"https://www.realestatenews.com/2025/04/11/the-latest-on-zillows-new-listings-rules-as-2nd-brokerage-commits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Zillow rep said this complies with Zillow&#8217;s standards</a> as long as a Coming Soon listing is entered in the MLS and is displayable on all sites receiving a feed. When the MLS syndicates these listings, Zillow will show them.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-happens-if-a-listing-gets-banned-from-zillow\">“What Happens If a Listing Gets Banned from Zillow?”</h3>\n<p>If a listing gets banned under Zillow’s new rule, the property isn’t blacklisted forever, but the original brokerage is. According to Zillow’s Errol Samuelson, if the listing is &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.realestatenews.com/2025/04/11/the-latest-on-zillows-new-listings-rules-as-2nd-brokerage-commits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">relisted with a different brokerage</a> and entered into the MLS within 24 hours of marketing, Zillow will display it.<br />Translation: if your brokerage messes up, the seller can fire you, relist with someone else, and still make it onto Zillow. But at that point, you’ve lost the listing, the client’s trust, and possibly your reputation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"will-there-still-be-off-market-private-listings\">“Will There Still Be Off-Market Private Listings?”</h3>\n<p>Yes—because sometimes privacy is the priority. Whether it’s a celebrity, a high-net-worth individual, or just someone who doesn’t want a sign in the yard or neighbors snooping, some sellers have no intention of going public. And, at eXp, sellers are fully informed of the tradeoffs. These homes aren’t meant for public marketing, and as long as the seller sticks to that plan, Zillow’s rule doesn’t apply.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-the-off-market-listing-battle-actually-matters\">Why the Off-Market Listing Battle Actually Matters</h2>\n<p>Off-market listings aren’t just a quirky tactic—they’ve become a flashpoint in real estate.

These aren’t your typical real estate sites that make agents fight for attention. Each one is purpose-built to support the agent experience from lead gen to closing (and all the chaos in between).</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re working with luxury buyers, savvy investors, or first-timers looking for homes on the MLS, eXp gives you a polished, tech-forward ecosystem that makes you look good and work even better. Here’s how agents benefit:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"attract-more-clients\">Attract More Clients</h3>\n<p>eXp websites open doors—literally and figuratively—by helping you connect with buyers and sellers through dynamic, customizable platforms.
