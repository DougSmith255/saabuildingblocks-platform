    "content": "<p>When comparing Fathom Realty and Douglas Elliman, the differences go far beyond just commission splits. These brokerages represent opposite ends of the spectrum—one built for independence and simplicity, the other grounded in luxury branding and traditional structure. This comparison breaks down the core categories agents care most about, so you can see which model fits your goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Douglas Elliman</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a true 100% commission model. Agents pay no franchise or royalty fees and keep all of their earnings. The only costs are a $700 annual fee and a flat transaction fee that ranges from $165 to $465 per deal, depending on plan structure and production volume. For agents who value transparency and want to control their income, Fathom makes it easy to calculate exactly what you’ll take home on every sale.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman sticks to the traditional commission split model, ranging from 50/50 up to 70/30 depending on experience, production, and negotiation. On top of that, agents are charged a 6% franchise fee that applies to every transaction. Monthly office fees vary by location, adding another layer of unpredictability for agents trying to manage expenses.</p>\n<p>For any agent focused on profitability, Fathom’s structure offers a clear advantage. With Douglas Elliman, the prestige of the brand comes at a real financial cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty does not offer any additional income opportunities such as stock programs, revenue share, or legacy income. Agents earn what they sell. This model is best suited for agents who want to stay focused on transactions and don’t mind that their earning power ends with their last closed deal.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman is built similarly. There is no revenue share, no profit share, no stock plan, and no path to earn passive or willable income. Just like Fathom, your only income source is what you close. That’s fine if your only goal is to sell, but limiting if you’re trying to build wealth or future-proof your business.</p>\n<p>For agents looking for a brokerage that offers long-term financial opportunity beyond the next commission check, neither of these two delivers.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty keeps overhead low by forgoing formal training programs. There’s no in-house coaching or structured onboarding beyond basic tools and materials, which works well for experienced agents who already have systems in place. But for newer agents or those switching markets, the lack of support can feel like a gap.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman does offer training, but like many traditional brokerages, it’s handled locally. What you get will depend entirely on your office, your manager, and your specific location. There’s no centralized platform or 24/7 support network to lean on, which can leave agents in a tough spot if they need help outside of business hours.</p>\n<p>In both cases, agents must be self-starters. Fathom agents benefit from a low-cost model but are largely on their own. Douglas Elliman agents may get more in-office attention—if they’re in the right office.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a lean tech platform centered around transaction management and internal communications. It gets the job done but doesn’t offer the kind of integrated marketing, CRM, or automation tools that some competitors do. Agents who are already using outside tools may not mind, but those looking for a fully supported system will need to invest in add-ons.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, in contrast, puts a lot of focus on luxury presentation. The marketing assets are polished, high-end, and geared toward luxury clientele. CRM and digital tools are available and generally more robust, but not always customizable or tech-forward compared to what’s offered at modern cloud brokerages.</p>\n<p>If you want simple systems and the freedom to run your business your way, Fathom will likely suit you. If you’re in luxury markets and need strong brand support and marketing materials that impress, Douglas Elliman brings more to the table.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty earns a strong 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor, with agents praising the 100% commission model and minimal fees. The most common complaints are tied to the lack of training and ongoing support, which can be a dealbreaker for agents who aren’t already self-sufficient.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman has a 3.9-star rating, based on over 600 reviews. While some agents appreciate the brand recognition and the opportunity to work in luxury markets, many mention the commission structure and high fees as sources of frustration. Support and training also receive mixed reviews, depending on the office.</p>\n<p>In short, Fathom agents tend to be satisfied with the financial model, while Douglas Elliman agents are split between loving the brand and feeling constrained by the cost of being there.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Douglas Elliman</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is ideal for independent agents who want to keep their full commission, work without micromanagement, and skip the endless fee structures that cut into profitability. It’s a streamlined model that rewards agents who already know how to run their business.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, on the other hand, appeals to agents who value brand prestige and operate in high-end markets. But that comes with a price—lower splits, franchise fees, and inconsistent training that make it harder for many agents to scale.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for simplicity and net income, Fathom wins. If you’re prioritizing luxury clientele and marketing presentation, Douglas Elliman might be worth the cost. Either way, it pays to consider what kind of growth you want—and whether your brokerage is really helping you build it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>This comparison between Real Broker and Sotheby’s International Realty will help agents determine which brokerage better fits their professional and financial goals. Both brokerages cater to different agent needs and preferences, offering distinct commission structures, income opportunities, and support systems.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-sothebys\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Sotheby’s</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers a highly competitive commission structure with splits ranging from 85/15 to 100/0. Agents at Real Broker don’t have to worry about franchise or royalty fees, allowing them to keep more of their earnings. The production cap is $12K, meaning once agents hit this cap, they retain 100% of their commission. On top of that, there’s a top agent bonus of $24K, which adds an extra incentive for high-performing agents. Monthly fees are $750/year, with no transaction fees until the cap is reached, making it a straightforward and agent-friendly fee model.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s, on the other hand, has commission splits ranging from 70/30 to 90/10, which can be lower than Real’s most favorable splits. The brokerage also charges a 6% franchise fee, which impacts agents’ take-home pay. Additionally, Sotheby’s does not offer a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split their commissions with the brokerage no matter how much they earn. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty structure, offering some predictability in costs, but the absence of a cap can significantly reduce an agent’s earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker stands out with its revenue share program, which allows agents to earn income by attracting new agents to the brokerage. This adds a passive income stream on top of commissions, making it an appealing option for agents who want to build a team. Real Broker also offers a retirement income path and willable income with time qualification, giving agents more control over their long-term financial planning.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income path, or willable income. Agents at Sotheby’s are limited to their commission-based income, which may not provide the same long-term wealth-building opportunities as Real Broker.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides agents with 30+ live training sessions per week and offers 24/7 agent support, ensuring agents can access resources and assistance whenever they need them. This extensive support structure makes Real Broker ideal for agents who want continuous education and real-time support.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s provides training that varies by office, meaning the quality of training may depend on the specific location. While the brokerage is known for its prestigious brand and client base, it does not offer 24/7 agent support, which can be a limitation for agents who need immediate help.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker has a modern, cloud-based platform that streamlines transactions and marketing efforts. Agents have access to advanced CRM systems and marketing tools, helping them optimize their workflows and provide top-tier service to clients.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s, being a traditional luxury brand, also offers powerful marketing tools and resources, particularly when it comes to branding and reaching high-end clientele. However, its technology offerings are more geared toward marketing luxury properties rather than cloud-based efficiency.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker holds a strong Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews, with agents praising the transparent fee structure, revenue share program, and agent support.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s has a 4.0-star rating from 501 reviews on Glassdoor. While the brand prestige and luxury market focus are often cited as benefits, agents also mention concerns over the higher fees and lack of additional income opportunities outside of commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-sothebys\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Sotheby’s</h3>\n<p>Real Broker is the better option for agents seeking more favorable commission splits, lower fees, and opportunities to earn passive income through a revenue share program. Its cloud-based platform and comprehensive agent support make it a standout choice for agents looking to build a modern, scalable real estate career.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s, however, is a good fit for agents targeting luxury clientele who value brand prestige. Its focus on marketing high-end properties and an established global brand are key advantages, but the higher costs and absence of a cap on commissions may not be ideal for every agent.</p>\n<p>For more information, explore our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to get a clearer understanding of which brokerage is right for you.

When agents think about real estate brokerage fees, they’re usually thinking of everything that comes <strong>out of their pocket.</strong></p>\n<p>That may be part of a commission split with the brokerage or a fee that gets tacked on annually, monthly, or when deals close. All of these fees have a <strong>direct impact</strong> on your take-home pay, and it’s crucial to know what to expect.</p>\n<p>This blog will focus on real estate brokerage fees that are charged to agents beyond brokerage commission splits. We did another video on just commission splits called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-pCC1QvFQc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Real Estate Companies to Work For &#8211; Highest Commissions Exposed</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-good-bad-and-ugly\">The Good, Bad, &#038; Ugly</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"good\">Good</h3>\n<p>Some non-franchise brokerages are <strong>super transparent</strong> and consistent with their fees, which is a huge win for agents. These brokerages offer more predictability, so you’ll know exactly what you&#8217;re paying each month or per transaction—no surprises.</p>\n<p>With the rise of <strong>cloud-based models</strong>, more brokerages are moving in this direction, making it easier for agents to plan their expenses.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bad\">Bad</h3>\n<p>Even with thorough research, it’s impossible to uncover every single broker fee out there. Why? Because many real estate brokerage fees <strong>vary from office to office</strong> within the same brokerage. This inconsistency is common in franchise models where individual real estate broker-owners have the freedom to set their own fee structures based on local costs and even personal preferences.</p>\n<p>So, what you pay at one office might be totally different from what an agent at another office is paying—even within the same brand.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ugly\">Ugly</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, real estate brokerage fees—including commission splits—aren’t set in stone and can change. Brokerages may adjust their fee structures if they’re facing financial difficulties or if the cost of running certain services goes up.</p>\n<p>When that happens, <strong>agents often end up footing the bill.</strong></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"avoiding-the-ugly\">Avoiding the Ugly</h3>\n<p>While you can’t always predict when a brokerage will hike up their fees due to rising service costs, you can keep an eye on their financial health. Brokerages struggling financially are more likely to raise fees. So how do you check a brokerage&#8217;s financial status?</p>\n<p>Look into publicly traded brokerages as those have transparent balance sheets.

I’m not talking about your professional association or MLS fees—those are paid directly to those organizations, not through your brokerage.</p>\n<p>Here, we’re focusing solely on what your brokerage charges you as an agent.</p>\n<p>Some real estate brokerage fees are due upfront annually or monthly, which can be a pain if you haven’t closed a deal yet. But, many brokers ease the burden by charging some fees as you complete transactions. Agents tend to prefer this setup since the fees align with the cash flow of closing a deal.</p>\n<p>We’ll start by breaking down the real estate brokerage fees you’ll be on the hook for whether or not you close deals, then move into the ones that can vary—sometimes upfront, sometimes taken out during transactions. Finally, we’ll wrap it up with fees which are typically only due when you complete a deal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-estate-brokerage-fees-due-regardless-of-income\">Real Estate Brokerage Fees Due Regardless of Income</h2>\n<p>These are often <strong>monthly fees, sometimes called desk fees</strong>, and you pay these real estate brokerage fees to your brokerage whether you’ve closed deals or not. They typically cover things like tech support, office space, and other resources.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty\">eXp Realty</h3>\n<p>eXp charges a flat monthly fee of $85. This covers your cloud-based tech, CRM, training, 24/7 broker support, and access to a vast and ever-growing array of resources. Since eXp is a cloud-based brokerage, this fee doesn’t include a physical desk at a local office.</p>\n<p>However, eXp does give agents access to 4,000 Regus business lounges worldwide, where you can meet clients if needed. Plus, eXp agents can even create their own custom virtual office to match their brand and meet with clients in the cloud. I know, it’s pretty wild, right?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-agency-berkshire-hathaway-better-homes-and-gardens-douglas-elliman-sothebys-coldwell-banker-keller-williams-remax-compass\">The Agency, Berkshire Hathaway, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Douglas Elliman, Sotheby’s, Coldwell Banker, Keller Williams, RE/MAX, Compass</h3>\n<p>These brokerages have office-specific monthly fees that vary widely. Some may have no fee at all, while others can charge up to $2,500 a month.</p>\n<p>From what we’ve gathered through agent reports and online resources like Reddit and Glassdoor, the most common monthly fees hover between $145 and $350. What does that get you? It varies, but typically it’ll get you a desk at your local office and access to the office’s amenities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees-upfront-or-per-sale\">Real Estate Brokerage Fees Due Upfront or Per Sale</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247778\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/c2ee1323835e9501-Real-Estate-Brokerage-Fees-Due-Upfront-or-Per-Sale.png/public\" alt=\"Real Estate Brokerage Fees, Real Estate Brokerage Fees Due Upfront or Per Sale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"240\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Real-Estate-Brokerage-Fees-Due-Upfront-or-Per-Sale.png 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Real-Estate-Brokerage-Fees-Due-Upfront-or-Per-Sale-300x72.png 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Real-Estate-Brokerage-Fees-Due-Upfront-or-Per-Sale-768x184.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about <strong>Errors &#038; Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance fees</strong>. These real estate brokerage fees can either be charged per transaction or upfront annually, and they’re crucial because they protect both you and your brokerage from legal issues. How E&#038;O fees are charged varies greatly depending on the brokerage.</p>\n<p>Paying upfront for E&#038;O fees can be a significant financial hit, especially if you haven’t closed any deals yet. All of the following results for these fees can vary according to location – except for eXp Realty which is always the same in every state.</p>\n<p>Let’s break it down:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-agency-sothebys-compass\">The Agency, Sotheby’s, Compass</h3>\n<p>At these brokerages, E&#038;O fees are paid upfront annually, meaning you’re on the hook for the fee whether or not you close any deals. The typical range is from $1,900 to $2,200, due when you first join and every year after that.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coldwell-banker-keller-williams\">Coldwell Banker, Keller Williams</h3>\n<p>These brokerages take a different approach by charging E&#038;O fees monthly, which means you’re still paying upfront, regardless of your sales. Fees range from $122 to $350 a month depending on the location and brokerage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-agency-berkshire-hathaway-better-homes-and-gardens-douglas-elliman-remax-refin\">The Agency, Berkshire Hathaway, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Douglas Elliman, RE/MAX, Refin</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, we couldn’t nail down specific E&#038;O fees for these brokerages. However, we know they exist, so if you’re considering joining one of these companies, make sure to ask about them when discussing your agreement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-2\">eXp Realty</h3>\n<p>Here’s where things get really interesting. At eXp Realty, E&#038;O insurance is charged per deal at a flat rate of $60. This fee is predictable, affordable, and capped at $750 per year. So, once you’ve hit that $750, you’re done for the year!</p>\n<p>How does eXp manage to keep these rates so low? It’s all about the economy of scale. While most brokerages have individual state policies, eXp uses one national policy, saving millions in costs and passing those savings on to agents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees-per-closed-deal\">Real Estate Brokerage Fees Due Per Closed Deal</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247777\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/2f1f821c39fd632b-Real-Estate-Brokerage-Fees-Due-Per-Closed-Deal.png/public\" alt=\"Real Estate Brokerage Fees Due Per Closed Deal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Real-Estate-Brokerage-Fees-Due-Per-Closed-Deal.png 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Real-Estate-Brokerage-Fees-Due-Per-Closed-Deal-300x59.png 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Real-Estate-Brokerage-Fees-Due-Per-Closed-Deal-768x152.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Let’s get into <strong>Franchise or Royalty Fees</strong>. These are real estate brokerage fees due when your brokerage is part of a franchise system. Here’s how it works: A global brand sells a franchise in the U.S., which then sells a franchise in each state, and further down to individual locations.</p>\n<p>Each layer of the franchise structure takes a piece of the pie, and that slice comes directly from your commission.</p>\n<p>Typically, these franchise fees range around 6%, meaning on top of your commission split, you’re paying this fee with every deal you close. And that fee gets spread across all those franchise levels above you.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-3\">eXp Realty</h3>\n<p>Good news here—eXp Realty is not a franchise, so franchise or royalty fees are $0 at eXp. That means you keep more of your hard-earned commission, which is a major plus for agents.</p>\n<p>The Agency, Berkshire Hathaway, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Douglas Elliman, Sotheby’s, Keller Williams</p>\n<p>These brokerages hit agents with a 6% royalty fee on every deal they close, or in Keller Williams case, until agents cap.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"century-21\">Century 21</h3>\n<p>Century 21 agents pay an even steeper franchise fee, coming in at 8%.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coldwell-banker\">Coldwell Banker</h3>\n<p>Coldwell Banker’s royalty fees range from 5% to 6.5%, depending on the office location.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"remax\">RE/MAX</h3>\n<p>RE/MAX agents are charged a 5% royalty fee on each closed deal.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>It’s important to note that franchise fees are tough to pin down, as many franchise brokerages aren’t upfront about these numbers. If you’ve worked at one of these brokerages and experienced a different royalty fee, drop a comment below and let us know!</p>\n<p>Another type of fee that is charged on each deal you close is the <strong>transaction fee</strong>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-4\">eXp Realty</h3>\n<p>eXp Realty charges a transaction fee of $25 per deal until you cap.  After you cap and you’re earning 100% of your commissions with no brokerage split or franchise fee, then you pay $250 per deal for your next 20 transactions at which point your transaction fee is reduced to $75 per deal.</p>\n<p>At eXp Realty, agents pay a $25 transaction fee per deal until they cap. Once you hit your cap and start earning 100% of your commissions, you’ll then pay a $250 transaction fee per deal for your next 20 transactions.</p>\n<p>After those 20 deals, your transaction fee drops to just $75 per deal for the rest of the year. So while the fee increases post-cap, it’s a small price to pay when you&#8217;re keeping 100% of your commissions!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-agency-better-homes-and-gardens-century-21-douglas-elliman-sothebys-coldwell-banker-keller-williams-remax\">The Agency, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Century 21, Douglas Elliman, Sotheby’s, Coldwell Banker, Keller Williams, RE/MAX</h3>\n<p>All of these brokerages, with their steep commission splits and franchise fees, cut agents a break here by not charging an additional transaction fee.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"berkshire-hathaway\">Berkshire Hathaway</h3>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway charges $295 &#8211; $625 per transaction, which admittedly seems out of line with all the other players we’re looking at.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap on Real Estate Brokerage Fees</h2>\n<p>And there you have it—a solid breakdown of real estate brokerage fees across some top brokerages. From franchise fees to monthly costs and E&#038;O insurance, these expenses can seriously eat into your bottom line.</p>\n<p>If keeping more of your hard-earned money matters to you, a brokerage like eXp Realty with its lower, more transparent and predictable fees, is worth a closer look.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

All of these fees have a direct impact on your take-home pay, and it’s crucial to know what to expect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-fees-do-real-estate-brokerages-charge-their-agents\">What real estate brokerage fees do agents pay?</h3>\n<p>There are a variety of real estate brokerage fees charged to agents. Most charge a commission split for closed deals. Franchise models also charge a franchise fee on top of the commission split percentage. Other fees could be desk fees, tech fees, and transaction fees. All brokerages charge some form of Error &#038; Omission (E&#038;O) insurance fees.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-brokerage-fee-structures-vary\">How do real estate brokerage fees differ in structure?</h3>\n<p>The structures for real estate brokerage fees vary widely, with some brokers charging a fixed fee for a particular fee either upfront annually or monthly regardless of agent closed sales and others taking a percentage of the sale price for the same fee. Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance fees are an example of wildly different brokerage fee structures. Agents need clarification of the structure of all fees at each brokerage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-do-real-estate-brokerage-fees-differ-between-states\">Why do real estate brokerage fees differ between states?</h3>\n<p>While eXp Realty’s fees do not differ between states, most real estate brokerage fees differ between states and between offices within states due to variations in local markets, regulatory environments, and competitive pressures among brokerages. Each franchise office has its unique dynamics that influence fee structures.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-it-better-to-choose-a-real-estate-broker-with-lower-fees\">Is it better to choose a broker with lower real estate brokerage fees?</h3>\n<p>Choosing a broker with lower real estate brokerage fees can save money, but it&#8217;s essential to consider the quality of service you and your clients will receive. A more experienced broker with a higher fee might offer better marketing strategies and negotiation skills, leading to a more favorable sale outcome.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-brokerage-fees-change\">Do real estate brokerage fees change?</h3>\n<p>Agents can’t predict when a brokerage will hike up their fees due to rising service costs, but agents can keep an eye on a brokerage’s financial health to indicate if real estate brokerage fees may go up at a particular brokerage. Brokerages struggling financially are more likely to raise fees. Look at publicly traded brokerages to determine this as those have transparent balance sheets.

These fees range from 25% to 55%, and they are well worth it for the quality business you gain. Plus, any future referral business you earn from doing a great job is all yours to keep—no more fees to Revenos.</p>\n<p>This is a fantastic opportunity for agents because:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Superior Lead Quality:</strong> Revenos leads are nothing like the 25% – 40% fees you pay to Realtor.com for Opcity leads, which are often low quality and rarely close. With Revenos, you&#8217;re investing in high-quality leads that convert.</li>\n<li><strong>Top Agent Pay:</strong> eXp Realty offers some of the highest agent pay in the real estate industry. Top agents can even earn more than 100% of their commission each year. If you&#8217;re not familiar with eXp Realty&#8217;s pay structure yet, check out our blog “2024 Guide to eXp Realty Commission and Fees” or visit our website at <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">Smart Agent Alliance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And there you have it.  eXp Realty with its Revenos division is the only real estate brokerage company constantly working and succeeding in supplying agents with quality leads. No other brokerage has a lead program like Revenos. That’s one of the advantages of being an agent at the most profitable brokerage out there, that’s the most agent-centric brokerage on the planet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Real Estate Agent Leads That Actually Work—Only at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>If you’re tired of paying top dollar for bottom-barrel leads, you’re not alone—and you’re definitely not stuck. At eXp Realty, the Revenos division flips the script by giving agents access to real estate agent leads that actually convert. These are serious buyers, motivated sellers, corporate relocations, military families, investors, and more—all matched to eXp agents through smart data and free training.</p>\n<p>And this isn’t just a “nice to have” perk.

    "content": "<p>When deciding between Real Broker and Keller Williams (KW), agents must weigh differences in commission splits, fees, training, and overall agent support. This comparison highlights key factors to help you determine which brokerage aligns best with your career objectives.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-kw\">Final Thoughts on Real vs KW</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> provides agents with a highly competitive commission split structure, offering 85/15 to 100/0 splits, with no franchise or royalty fees. Real Broker also has a production cap set at $12K, meaning once agents hit this cap, they keep 100% of their commissions. Furthermore, top producers can qualify for a $24K bonus, which significantly boosts their earning potential. The annual fees are a flat $750 per year, and there are no transaction fees until the cap is reached.</p>\n<p><strong>KW (Keller Williams)</strong>, in contrast, offers commission splits starting at 70/30 and going up to 100/0, depending on the office location. However, agents are required to pay a 6% franchise fee until they reach the cap, which impacts their overall earnings. KW&#8217;s production cap varies between $21K and $30K, depending on the market center, which is higher than Real Broker’s cap. Monthly fees at KW also vary based on the office, and transaction fees are generally included within the royalty fee structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>One area where <strong>Real Broker</strong> shines is through its revenue share program, which allows agents to earn passive income by recruiting new agents to the brokerage. This revenue-sharing opportunity creates an additional income stream for agents interested in building a team. Real Broker also offers both retirement income and willable income options, providing long-term financial stability.</p>\n<p><strong>KW</strong> also offers a revenue share model, often referred to as &#8220;profit share,&#8221; which rewards agents for recruiting others. However, KW does not offer retirement income or willable income paths, which limits some of the long-term financial planning options that Real Broker provides.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> stands out with its extensive training options, providing over 30 live training sessions each week. These sessions cover topics ranging from lead generation to transaction management, ensuring agents are equipped to succeed. Additionally, Real Broker offers 24/7 agent support, which is critical for agents who need real-time help or guidance during transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>KW</strong> is well-known for its comprehensive training programs, which are widely regarded as some of the best in the industry. The KW University platform provides agents with various training modules to enhance their skills. However, unlike Real Broker, KW does not provide 24/7 support, which could be a limitation for agents who need assistance outside of regular business hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> provides its agents with an advanced, cloud-based system that integrates CRM, marketing platforms, and transaction management tools seamlessly. This streamlined technology stack makes it easier for agents to manage leads and grow their businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>KW</strong> also offers a solid technology platform through its proprietary <strong>Command</strong> system, designed to help agents track leads, manage transactions, and create marketing campaigns. While KW has invested heavily in its tech, some agents report challenges with its functionality compared to Real Broker’s more straightforward, cloud-based tools.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p><strong>Real Broker</strong> has a Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars based on 109 reviews, with agents praising its transparency in fees, multiple income streams, and excellent support systems.</p>\n<p><strong>KW</strong> holds a 4.3-star rating from 7.9K reviews. Many agents appreciate the comprehensive training and the brand’s established reputation but have expressed concerns about the higher fees and office-based variations in support.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-kw\">Final Thoughts on Real vs KW</h3>\n<p>For agents seeking a modern, cloud-based brokerage with lower fees, a lower production cap, and robust income opportunities, <strong>Real Broker</strong> is an excellent choice. The added benefit of 24/7 support and multiple revenue streams make it a top contender for agents looking for flexibility and long-term career growth.</p>\n<p><strong>KW</strong> offers strong training programs and a well-known brand, but higher fees and the lack of some income opportunities may make it less appealing for agents looking to maximize their earnings and wealth-building potential.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to explore further, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to dive deeper into how these brokerages compare.

First up, youve got the <strong>pre-licensing course</strong>, which typically costs between $150 and $1,000, depending on your state and whether you opt for online or in-person classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Study guides</strong>, which make prepping for your exam easier, can add another $35 to your expenses. Then theres the <strong>state exam fee</strong> itself, usually around $100 to $400, plus the <strong>background check</strong>, which runs anywhere from $22 to $100 depending on where you live.</p>\n<p>Once you pass the exam, youll need to pay a fee to obtain your <strong>real estate license</strong>anywhere from $150 to $350. But dont forget, some states also require <strong>post-licensing education</strong> to keep your license active, which can range from $50 to $450.</p>\n<p>All in all, getting your real estate license will likely cost you between $500 and $1,500, depending on your state and choices. For more exact information on the licensing process and fees in your state check out <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/how-to-get-a-real-estate-license/\">more information here</a>. https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/how-to-get-a-real-estate-license/</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-fees\">Brokerage fees</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247680\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ebf484a8c48b5a2d-Brokerage-Fees.webp/public\" alt=\"Real Estate Agent Expenses, Brokerage Fees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"179\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Brokerage-Fees.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Brokerage-Fees-300x54.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Brokerage-Fees-768x137.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Once you have your real estate license, the next step is joining a brokerage, and with that comes a whole new set of real estate agent expenses. First off, theres the <strong>commission split</strong>this is where the brokerage takes a percentage of your earnings. Splits can vary widely, mostly in the range from a generous 90/10 split to a heftier 50/50, which can make a big difference in your take-home pay.</p>\n<p>On top of that, many brokerages charge an <strong>initial start-up fee</strong>, usually around $50 &#8211; $150, just for joining. After that, youll likely be paying <strong>monthly fees or annual fees. </strong>These range from about $85 to thousands per month, which covers the brokerages ongoing support, office space, tech platforms, tools, and resources.</p>\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s <strong>Errors &#038; Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance</strong>, a necessary protection against potential lawsuits, which typically costs anywhere from $60 per transaction to $2200 upfront before you have any deals. So, yes, this is a big one to know the exact amount.</p>\n<p>All these real estate agent expenses vary wildly between brokerages. To get more thorough information on brokerage splits and fees check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\"><strong>brokerage comparison tool here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Overall, these expenses can add up quickly, so its essential to compare brokerages and to know what brokerages offer in return, whether its resources, training, or marketing materials.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"professional-fees\">Professional Fees</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247684\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0f3dff2f01dbdfe7-Professional-Fees.webp/public\" alt=\"Professional Fees\" width=\"1000\" height=\"195\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Fees.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Fees-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Fees-768x150.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Once youve joined a brokerage, there are some additional professional fees to consider. One of the most common is the cost of joining the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>National Association of REALTORS</strong></a> (NAR), which can be a great boost to your career.</p>\n<p>While not always mandatory, NAR membership gives you access to valuable tools like marketing guidance, tech solutions, exclusive discounts, and a network of over a million associates. Membership also offers you the prestigious REALTOR designation, which can elevate your credibility. <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/membership/dues-information\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NAR dues</a> are around $150 per year. https://www.nar.realtor/membership/dues-information</p>\n<p><strong>State and local real estate boards</strong> may also charge a few hundred dollars or more annually for membership. On top of that, there are MLS (Multiple Listing Service) fees, which run about $150 to $500 per year. The MLS is essential for real estate agents as it gives you access to property listings, making it a must-have for anyone serious about their real estate career.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"operational-expenses\">Operational Expenses</h2>\n<p>When it comes to operational real estate agent expenses, things can add up quickly in your real estate career. One of the first expenses youll need to consider is <strong>building and maintaining a website</strong>, which can cost anywhere from $180 to $3,480 per year, depending on how fancy you want it to be.</p>\n<p>Other website options can be to use a personal website that your brokerage offers. For example, eXp Realty agents get a personal IDX website (more than a page on the brokerage website) that is part of their $85 monthly fee. That helps keep costs down!</p>\n<p>Then there are the <strong>business cards</strong>around $500 a year for a memorable design that leaves an impression. Plus, <strong>promotional items</strong> like branded pens or magnets can keep your name in front of clients, helping you stay top of mind for future business.</p>\n<p>Also dont forget about <strong>travel expenses</strong>, especially since real estate agents are always on the move. Expect to pay at least $2,000 a year on gas, car maintenance, insurance, and maybe even the occasional plane ticket if youre attending national conferences.</p>\n<p>If you work from home, <strong>office expenses</strong> like internet, paper, and pens will add up to about $2,400 per year. Plus, youll need a reliable printer and scanner to keep your documents in check.</p>\n<p><strong>Health insurance</strong> is another biggie, costing roughly $450 per month for individuals and more for families. However, again, large brokerages like eXp Realty that leverage their size and influence have access to much lower-cost healthcare options for individuals and families. More about that <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-healthcare/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>And there are more operational real estate agent expenses. There are <strong>transaction coordinators</strong> to help with deal paperwork likely costing from $300 &#8211; $700 per transaction.</p>\n<p>Even small costs like <strong>lockbox keys</strong> (about $15-$25 a month), and all-important <strong>client lunches and gifts</strong> ($25-$150 a month) can make a dent. But remember, these tools and services keep your real estate business running smoothly, so its smart to budget for them upfront!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"listing-expenses\">Listing Expenses</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247682\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d45f0894eb64c3c2-Listinng-Expenses.webp/public\" alt=\"Real Estate Agent Expenses, Listing Expenses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"223\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Listinng-Expenses.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Listinng-Expenses-300x67.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Listinng-Expenses-768x171.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>When it comes to listing expenses, they can stack up quickly, but theyre key to making your properties stand out and attracting potential buyers.</p>\n<p>First off, youll want to invest in <strong>real estate signs</strong>, which typically run between $50 and $150 per sign. Youll also need <strong>lockboxes</strong> for your listings, usually around $100 each, to keep the property secure during showings.</p>\n<p>Hiring <strong>professional photographers or videographers</strong> is crucial to showcase the homes best features online, with costs ranging from $100 to $500 per listing.</p>\n<p>You also may need <strong>2D or 3D floor plans, single property websites, drone shots, and 3D walkthroughs</strong>. Expect to tack on $500 to $1500 more here. And if youre listing luxury properties, expect these costs to be closer to $5000.</p>\n<p><strong>Printing listing flyers</strong> adds another $50 &#8211; $300 to your expenses while promoting the listing through social media ads or classifieds could cost anywhere from $100 to thousands.</p>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>open houses</strong>, youll need to budget for snacks, drinks, and other refreshments to make the experience inviting, typically costing $50 to $250 per open house.</p>\n<p>If you really want to go the extra mile, and if its economically feasible, consider <strong>staging</strong> the home, which can lead to faster sales and higher prices, making it a worthy investment.</p>\n<p>All in all, listing-related expenses for each listing can range from $1,000 to multi-thousands annually, depending on how you choose to market the property. Its these extra touches that can make a big difference in how quickly and successfully you close deals. And, thats what you want &#8211; a payday to refund you for all your expenses!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lead-generation-expenses\">Lead Generation Expenses</h2>\n<p>When it comes to generating leads, real estate agent expenses can add up, but theyre crucial for growing your business. <strong>Advertising</strong> your services is one of the biggest investments, with most agents costs ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 annually or more!</p>\n<p>In your first year, marketing will likely take a big chunk of your budget. Youll either pay for it upfront or invest your <strong>blood, sweat, and tears</strong> with low-cost methods such as door-knocking, calling FSBOs, or creating organic social media accounts and YouTube channels. </p>\n<p>On top your actual advertising, youll need a process to keep your leads and communication with them all organized. Youll need a <strong>CRM</strong> &#8211; customer relationship management tool &#8211; to accomplish that. CRMS can cost $1000, $3000, or even more. But some brokerages, like eXp Realty, include top-end CRMs as part of their agent fee package without additional agent expense.</p>\n<p>While advertising significantly adds to your real estate agent expenses, it increases your visibility and provides prospects for you to convert to deal-closing clients!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"professional-development-fees\">Professional Development Fees</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247683\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/234af035cda493be-Professional-Developmennt.webp/public\" alt=\"Professional Development\" width=\"1000\" height=\"174\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Developmennt.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Developmennt-300x52.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Professional-Developmennt-768x134.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Staying sharp in real estate means ongoing learning, and that comes with a price tag. <strong>Continuing education</strong> (CE) courses are essential for agents who want to keep their licenses and thrive in a competitive market. On average, agents spend around $200 per year on these courses, but costs vary by state.</p>\n<p>Beyond the basic requirements, agents often take classes to<strong> earn certifications and gain designations</strong> to boost their expertise and credibility. These investments enhance skills and open doors to new client opportunities and specialized niches. Costs range from hundreds to thousands.</p>\n<p><strong>Networking events</strong> are another real estate agent expense, allowing agents to meet new people, exchange ideas, and grow their businesses. Sometimes, these events require travel and accommodations, adding to the cost, but the payoff in connections and potential clients makes it worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Hosting your own events can also be a smart investment, giving you a platform to stand out and expand your network in the real estate world.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"financial-planning\">Financial Planning</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re a real estate agent, financial planning is a must, especially since most agents are classified as independent contractors. This means youre responsible for covering self-employment taxes, which include both Medicare and Social Securitythe costs that a typical employer would handle.</p>\n<p>But dont worry; there are perks too! Many work-related expenses, like gas, office supplies, and even marketing costs, can be claimed as tax deductions. Keeping track of these deductions helps offset the self-employment tax burden.</p>\n<p>Its also important to budget for quarterly tax payments to avoid a hefty bill at the end of the year. Agents should also work closely with a tax professional who can ensure theyre taking advantage of all possible deductions, making tax time smoother and more financially beneficial.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">Thats a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Becoming a real estate agent comes with exciting opportunities, but it carries significant real estate agent expenses. From licensing and brokerage fees to ongoing expenses, agents face a variety of costs that can add up quickly.</p>\n<p>However, you can manage these expenses effectively while building a successful and lucrative career. Understanding these financial commitments upfront will help you stay ahead and thrive in the competitive world of real estate.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>By partnering with us, youll be joining the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\">ONLY profitable public brokerage in the past 5 years</a> that agents rank as the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>With Smart Agent Alliance</strong> youll enjoy personalized day-to-day concierge care plus assets like customizable agent presentations, business automation, production checklists, customizable social media posts, and <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/team-benefits/\">so much more.</a></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d64578f59bcb5588-Resize-3.webp/public\" alt=\"Group photo of Wolf Pack team members at eXp CON\" class=\"wp-image-3493\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3.webp 960w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-300x169.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Resize-3-768x432.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n<p>As a member of our team, youll also enjoy exclusive access to the <strong>Wolf Pack weekly webinars</strong>, <strong>Social Agent Academy</strong> for social media training, the <strong>Wolf Pack Hub</strong> for easy onboarding, Investor Army for investing and flipping houses training, and more.</p>\n<p>Dont miss out on this amazing opportunity to maximize your earnings and build a thriving agent business. <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-our-exp-realty-sponsor-team/\">Join eXp Realty today</a> and <strong>experience unparalleled support</strong> from our FREE team.</p>\n<p>Not quite convinced?

There’s no production cap, which means that even top-producing agents continue to split commissions and pay fees indefinitely. Transaction fees are wrapped into that structure, but Corcoran also charges separate costs for E&#038;O insurance—often on the higher end. Monthly office fees vary by location, adding more inconsistency to an agent’s cost structure.</p>\n<p>If your goal is maximizing profit, Fathom offers clarity and savings. Corcoran, while built for luxury branding, definitely takes a bigger cut.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is strictly transactional. There’s no revenue share, no stock awards, and no pathway to earn retirement or willable income through the company. You earn what you sell—full stop. That’s great if you’re focused on commissions today but offers no passive income potential for the future.</p>\n<p>Corcoran operates similarly. There are no residual income paths, equity awards, or wealth-building opportunities beyond traditional sales. Like Fathom, you sell, you earn, and that’s where the income stops.</p>\n<p>Neither brokerage supports agents in building long-term financial freedom. If you want your income to grow beyond what you personally produce, you’ll have to look elsewhere.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty keeps things lean, which means there’s no formal in-house training and no around-the-clock agent support. This model works well for seasoned agents who are already operating independently, but may leave newer agents feeling a little stranded.</p>\n<p>Corcoran does provide training, but the quality and structure vary significantly depending on the local office. There&#8217;s no universal system, and like Fathom, there’s no 24/7 support, so you’re dependent on office availability and manager responsiveness. It’s workable if you&#8217;re in a high-performing office, but it&#8217;s inconsistent across the board.</p>\n<p>For both brokerages, self-motivation is a must. You won’t find structured national programs or on-demand mentorship platforms here.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a tech platform that covers the basics—transaction management, client communication, and compliance tools. It gets the job done, but it’s not designed to impress. If you want cutting-edge marketing automation, AI-powered CRMs, or integrated branding systems, you’ll need to add your own tools or join a team that provides them.</p>\n<p>Corcoran, with its luxury real estate focus, does provide high-end marketing resources. Presentation matters here, and the materials reflect that. Their technology isn’t necessarily more advanced, but it’s geared toward the polished look and feel expected in luxury markets. Still, it’s not a cloud-based platform and doesn’t offer the kind of flexibility or innovation you’ll find with more modern models.</p>\n<p>In short, Fathom gives you the freedom to build with lean tools. Corcoran provides stronger branding, but the tech behind it may not evolve as fast as today’s most scalable brokerages.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty has earned a solid 4.6-star rating from hundreds of agent reviews on Glassdoor. Agents regularly praise the simplicity of the model and the ability to keep more of their income. Common frustrations center around the lack of training and the self-reliance required to succeed.</p>\n<p>Corcoran comes in slightly behind with a 4.4-star rating. Agents often speak highly of the company’s luxury brand and marketing support but also note concerns about high fees and commission splits that chip away at earnings. Again, office-by-office experiences vary, and that inconsistency shows up in the reviews.</p>\n<p>Both brokerages have their loyal fans—but the financial structure at Fathom tends to generate more consistent praise.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-corcoran\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Corcoran</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a match for agents who want to maximize their commission, eliminate unnecessary fees, and run their business without extra layers. It’s not for agents who need hand-holding or crave the cachet of a big-name brand, but it’s built for independence and profitability.</p>\n<p>Corcoran is a fit for agents committed to the luxury space who value strong marketing assets and a prestigious brand. However, you’ll pay for that brand recognition through lower splits and higher fees—and you won’t get much in return when it comes to wealth-building options or passive income.</p>\n<p>If you’re just comparing these two, the question becomes: do you want to be branded or be profitable?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>This isn’t just another brokerage comparison — it’s a real look at how your paycheck, support, and business tools will be affected by your choice. Whether you&#8217;re drawn to the simplicity of flat fees or the prestige of a well-known name, here&#8217;s how Fathom Realty and Better Homes &#038; Gardens Real Estate compare where it counts.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-better-homes-gardens\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Better Homes &#038; Gardens</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>At Fathom Realty, the 100/0 commission split means what it says — agents keep every cent of their commission. There are no franchise or royalty fees taking a cut, and agents enjoy complete freedom from production caps. The only recurring costs are a flat $700 annual fee and a per-transaction fee between $150 and $250. This predictable, no-frills model has been one of Fathom’s biggest selling points for agents who want to simplify their finances and scale their business without penalty.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens, in contrast, operates under a traditional split model that ranges from 60/40 to 80/20. The company also takes a 6% franchise or royalty fee, which further trims the agent’s net income. There’s no cap in place, so even top producers continue paying the split. Monthly fees vary based on office and region, and while transaction fees are baked into the royalty structure, there are additional costs like E&#038;O insurance. Overall, it’s a higher-cost model, even though it comes with the familiarity of a household brand.</p>\n<p>If your goal is to keep more of what you earn, Fathom&#8217;s lean model clearly gives you more breathing room.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty doesn’t offer revenue share, equity awards, or retirement paths — it’s a commission-only setup. What you close is what you make, and that’s where it ends. It’s clean and simple, but there’s no added value for long-term wealth building.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens follows the same philosophy. Agents earn their commission and have no access to recurring income, revenue sharing, or other wealth-building incentives. So while the company supports sales activity with its branding, it doesn’t reward agents beyond the deals they personally close.</p>\n<p>Neither model offers additional income streams, which may work fine for those focused only on transactions, but won’t meet the needs of agents thinking about scaling or exiting the business someday.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty has earned a reputation for being agent-friendly, but it doesn’t provide structured training or 24/7 support. That approach works well for confident, experienced agents who already know the ropes, but may feel limiting to newer agents seeking mentorship or coaching. The low overhead and minimal intrusion are perks for self-starters, but not ideal for someone who needs handholding.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens does offer training, but it varies by office. Some locations are known for robust support and onboarding, while others offer the bare minimum. Like Fathom, there’s no 24/7 support, so agents are largely dependent on local managers and office culture for help.</p>\n<p>In both models, success depends heavily on your own initiative and your specific office environment.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty gives agents access to basic tech tools like transaction management systems and CRMs. It’s not flashy, but it gets the job done. There’s no massive tech suite, and agents who want advanced lead generation or marketing platforms will need to build that stack independently or join a team that offers it.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens leans into technology and branding more heavily. With the backing of a recognizable brand, agents can access strong marketing resources and CRM systems designed to support high visibility and lead follow-up. These tools can be especially useful for agents who are less tech-savvy or who want to plug into a ready-made system.</p>\n<p>Fathom provides the essentials with freedom to customize. Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers a more fully built platform, but it comes at a higher cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty currently holds a 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor, with hundreds of agents praising the simple commission structure, predictable fees, and freedom to operate independently. Agents regularly mention financial clarity as one of the biggest advantages.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens earns a slightly lower rating of 4.3 stars from fewer total reviews. Agents tend to appreciate the branding, marketing tools, and name recognition, but also mention the pain of ongoing fees and limited income options as recurring downsides.</p>\n<p>If agent reviews are any indicator, the satisfaction difference often comes down to expectations — whether agents prioritize branding or bottom-line income.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-better-homes-gardens\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Better Homes &#038; Gardens</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is the choice for agents who want full commission, fixed fees, and minimal brokerage interference. It’s best suited for those who value autonomy and know how to manage their business without needing constant support or tech-heavy tools.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens makes more sense for agents who want the credibility of a national brand and access to advanced marketing resources. But it comes with the trade-off of lower commission retention and more ongoing costs, with no cap in sight.</p>\n<p>Neither brokerage supports passive income, equity, or long-term wealth strategies. If that’s what you’re looking for, you may want to explore an alternative that gives you both earning power and financial growth opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.<strong></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

This flexibility allows agents to maximize their earnings. There are no franchise or royalty fees, making it more cost-effective for agents who want to keep a higher percentage of their commissions. The production cap at LPT Realty is $15K, meaning agents keep 100% of their commissions after hitting this cap. Monthly fees vary, with options as low as $500/year plus $0 or $89/month, or $149/month, depending on the agent&#8217;s choice. Transaction fees are $195 before reaching the cap.</p>\n<p>In contrast, RE/MAX has commission splits that start at 60/40 and go up to 95/5. However, RE/MAX charges a 5% franchise/royalty fee, which reduces agents&#8217; take-home earnings. The production cap is significantly higher at $23K, and monthly fees range from $300 to $2,500, making RE/MAX a more costly option for agents. Transaction fees are included in the royalty fees, which may provide some predictability, but the higher fees overall can reduce the agent’s bottom line.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out by offering a revenue share program, allowing agents to earn additional income through team building and recruitment. This offers an extra stream of passive income beyond commissions. LPT also provides retirement income and willable income paths, offering agents a long-term financial security option.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX, on the other hand, does not offer a revenue share program, nor does it provide retirement or willable income paths. Agents at RE/MAX rely solely on their commission-based income, which may limit long-term financial planning options.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not have a specified formal training program but offers 24/7 agent support, ensuring that agents have access to help when needed. This level of support is crucial for agents who prefer having consistent access to resources and guidance.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX provides access to its Online University for training, which is a structured learning platform. However, it lacks 24/7 support, which may be a downside for agents who need more immediate assistance, particularly in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides agents with access to a variety of technology tools and platforms designed to enhance their marketing and client management efforts. The cloud-based model allows for flexibility and efficiency, especially for agents on the go.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX also invests in technology, offering agents tools for lead management, marketing, and transaction handling. However, the higher cost structure may make these tools less attractive compared to LPT Realty’s more affordable options.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a 4.3-star rating on Glassdoor, with 37 reviews. Agents appreciate the flexibility in commission splits, lower fees, and income opportunities through the revenue share model.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX holds a 4.2-star rating from 3.3K reviews. While the brand recognition and vast network are major benefits, agents often mention the high fees as a downside.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-re-max\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs REMAX</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers more flexibility with commission splits, lower fees, and additional income streams through its revenue share program, retirement income path, and willable income options. This makes it a great choice for agents who want to maximize their income potential while keeping their costs low.</p>\n<p>RE/MAX, on the other hand, is a well-established brand with strong name recognition and a large network, but its higher fees and lack of additional income opportunities may make it less attractive for agents focused on long-term financial growth.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.
