    "content": "<p>If you’re choosing between Fathom Realty and Keller Williams, the decision often hinges on what you value more: keeping every commission dollar or gaining access to passive income and world-class training. These two brokerages take very different approaches to supporting agents, and understanding those differences can help you make the right move for your career and financial goals.</p>\n<p>In this comparison, we’ll break down the real numbers and benefits behind Fathom and KW—from fees and income potential to support and satisfaction—so you can clearly see which model aligns best with how you want to build your business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Keller Williams</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is known for its clean, no-split commission model. Agents keep 100% of their commissions without paying any franchise or royalty fees. Costs are minimal, with transaction fees ranging from $165 to $465 depending on your plan and an annual fee of $700. There’s no production cap, which simplifies the process for high-volume agents, and there are no performance-based bonuses either—just predictable, transparent income with no surprises.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams takes a more traditional approach. Most agents start on a 70/30 split, although high producers may reach 100% after hitting a production cap, which typically ranges from $21,000 to $30,000 depending on the office. A 6% franchise fee applies until the cap is reached, and monthly desk fees vary by location. On top of that, E&#038;O insurance can cost between $122 and $350 per month, depending on the region. These ongoing fees can take a significant bite out of commissions, especially for newer agents still working to gain traction.</p>\n<p>While Fathom focuses on simplicity and agent take-home pay, Keller Williams offers more resources—but at a higher cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty keeps it simple—what you earn is what you sell. There’s no revenue share, no retirement income program, and no willable income. For agents who are focused solely on commission income and aren’t concerned with building long-term residual streams, this model may be sufficient. But for those looking to scale their business or build wealth beyond closings, the lack of secondary income paths can be limiting.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams offers agents a revenue share program that pays agents for attracting others to the company. While this program requires time and relationship-building to yield results, it can be a powerful source of passive income over time. In addition, KW offers a retirement income path that provides more financial stability as agents move into later stages of their career. For agents who value multiple income streams and are open to mentorship and leadership, Keller Williams provides more long-term financial upside than Fathom.</p>\n<p>That said, KW’s income opportunities come with a cost. Participation in the revenue share program doesn&#8217;t reduce your office expenses or splits, so the benefits depend on how much you recruit and how well your team performs.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers no formal training programs or live coaching. There’s no onboarding process for new agents and no 24/7 support. While experienced agents who already have systems in place might not miss the structure, newer agents or those switching markets often find the lack of training to be a challenge. This hands-off approach works for self-starters but can leave others feeling stranded.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams, in contrast, has built its reputation around agent training. Many agents consider KW’s education programs to be among the best in the industry. Through in-office mentorship, structured training events, and the Keller Williams University platform, agents have access to development at every level of their career. However, many of these courses come with a price tag, ranging from $299 to as high as $2,500 depending on the program. KW doesn’t offer 24/7 support either, but the structured environment and access to local leaders often help bridge that gap.</p>\n<p>For agents who learn best through direct instruction, consistent coaching, and a team environment, Keller Williams has the upper hand. But for those who want low fees and already know what they’re doing, Fathom keeps things lean and cost-effective.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty’s tech stack includes basic tools for transaction management and some marketing functionality. It’s designed to help agents complete the essentials, but it lacks advanced features like predictive analytics, AI lead follow-up, or customizable CRMs. Agents looking for more robust systems will need to invest in their own tools or work with third-party services.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams has invested heavily in its proprietary technology platform. Agents have access to command centers for lead tracking, client management, and marketing automation, as well as an integrated CRM. These tools are designed to streamline an agent’s workflow and create a scalable business, especially in busy markets. The level of tech at KW can be a significant advantage for agents juggling high volumes or running teams. However, some agents find the tools overwhelming or underutilized, and as with everything at KW, the cost must be weighed against the benefit.</p>\n<p>Agents who value built-in tech will find more at Keller Williams, but those who prefer to control their own systems—or save money—may feel more at home with Fathom.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty maintains a strong Glassdoor rating of 4.6 out of 5. Agents often cite the commission structure and low fees as the biggest advantages, especially for independent-minded professionals. However, the most common critique is the lack of mentorship and growth support, which can become a sticking point for agents looking to scale or refine their skills.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams has a 4.3 rating, with thousands of reviews highlighting the quality of training and culture of collaboration. Many agents appreciate the opportunities to grow, learn, and earn through revenue share. At the same time, some reviews mention frustration with high fees and inconsistent experiences depending on office leadership. Franchise offices vary widely, so an agent’s satisfaction often depends on the specific KW office they join.</p>\n<p>The most satisfied agents today are those who feel both empowered and supported. For some, that means lower fees and autonomy. For others, it means paying more but gaining access to live mentorship, business tools, and income diversification.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Keller Williams</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a smart choice for agents who want maximum take-home pay and a no-frills model. If you’re confident in your skills, have your own tools in place, and don’t need mentorship or extra training, Fathom offers financial freedom with minimal overhead. But if you’re looking to build a long-term business, the lack of revenue share, training, or support may start to feel restrictive.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams, meanwhile, offers a broader ecosystem of income opportunities, education, and proprietary tools. It’s an excellent fit for agents who value training, want to participate in revenue share, and are focused on building wealth over time. The trade-off is higher fees and a more corporate structure—but for many agents, that structure provides exactly the support they need to grow.</p>\n<p>Of course, if neither of these models feels like the right fit, there’s a third path that combines the best of both.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

There is no franchise or royalty fee, which helps agents retain a larger portion of their earnings. LPT Realty has a production cap of $15K, and once agents hit the cap, they keep 100% of their commissions. Monthly fees range from $0 to $149 per month, depending on the agent&#8217;s chosen plan. Transaction fees are $195 before the cap is reached, providing predictability in costs.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers commission splits between 60/40 and 80/20. While this is competitive, it may not be as appealing to agents seeking higher earnings. The franchise fee is set at 6%, and there is no production cap, meaning agents will continue paying franchise fees regardless of their production level. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the royalty structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers additional income opportunities beyond commissions, including a revenue share program. This allows agents to build a team and earn passive income, enhancing their long-term financial stability. LPT Realty also provides retirement income and willable income paths, giving agents more control over their future.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens does not offer revenue share, retirement income, or willable income paths. Agents working at Better Homes &#038; Gardens are limited to commission-based income, which may not provide the same level of long-term financial security as LPT Realty’s additional income streams.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides no formal training but offers 24/7 agent support, which is beneficial for agents who value immediate assistance. This support is particularly helpful for agents who need help with transactions or business development outside regular business hours.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers training that varies by office, so the level of education and support may depend on location. However, it does not provide 24/7 support, which could be a limitation for agents needing real-time help.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides agents with modern technology tools, including CRM systems and marketing platforms, to help streamline their work and boost productivity. The brokerage focuses on using tech to support agents in growing their business and staying competitive in the market.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens also offers technological resources, particularly marketing tools, but the level of available technology support varies by office. Agents working in locations with fewer resources may find that they lack access to the most up-to-date technology, which could impact their ability to compete effectively in their markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 37 reviews. Agents appreciate the transparent fee structure and the additional income opportunities provided by the brokerage.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 256 reviews. While agents highlight the strong brand reputation and marketing support, they often express concerns over the higher franchise fees and the absence of revenue-sharing or retirement benefits.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-better-homes-gardens\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Better Homes &#038; Gardens</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out for its favorable commission splits, lower fees, and multiple income streams, making it an excellent choice for agents looking to maximize their earnings and build long-term wealth. The 24/7 agent support and modern technology offerings also provide a more flexible and agent-friendly experience.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens is a well-known and reputable brand, which can be beneficial for agents looking to leverage brand recognition in their marketing. However, the lack of additional income opportunities and ongoing franchise fees may limit the financial potential for agents focused on long-term growth.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

Our templates include optional spaces for QR codes, linking directly to your website or social media platforms. This integration ensures that potential clients can learn more about you with a single scan, bridging the gap between offline interactions and your online portfolio.</p>\n<p>Adding digital elements like QR codes helps reinforce your tech-savvy image while providing quick access to listings or client testimonials, giving your card extended utility in the digital age.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-branding-tools-for-real-estate-agents\">More Branding Tools for Real Estate Agents</h2>\n<p>Your business card is only one part of your overall branding strategy. To create a consistent brand experience, it’s essential to use similar design elements across other materials such as flyers, brochures, and listing sheets. By doing so, you present a cohesive and professional image that clients will recognize and trust.</p>\n<p>At eXp Realty and within the Smart Agent Alliance (that&#8217;s us!), agents have access to customizable templates for various marketing needs?. This makes it easier to maintain uniform branding across all print and digital assets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dont-forget-to-show-your-card-design-to-your-broker\">Don&#8217;t Forget to Show Your Card Design to Your Broker</h2>\n<p>Before you print your new business cards, make sure to show your design to your broker. This crucial step ensures that your card meets state rules and regulations for real estate advertising. Brokers can verify that the required information, such as license numbers or brokerage details, is correctly displayed and compliant with local laws. Taking this step helps you avoid potential issues and guarantees that your branding aligns with both legal standards and professional guidelines.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Business-Card-Template-Bloog-Images-3.webp\" alt=\"Business Card Template Blog Images 3\" class=\"wp-image-249458\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Business-Card-Template-Bloog-Images-3.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Business-Card-Template-Bloog-Images-3-300x86.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Business-Card-Template-Bloog-Images-3-768x219.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-access-and-use-the-templates\">Download and Use the Templates</h2>\n<p>Getting started with these custom business card templates is simple:</p>\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fill Out The Form Bellow</strong>: Submission of the form will automatically send you to the templates.</li>\n<li><strong>Sign In to <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva</a></strong>: If you don’t already have an account, you can sign up for free.</li>\n<li><strong>Make a Copy</strong>: Once you’ve accessed the template, make a copy to customize it without affecting the original design.</li>\n<li><strong>Customize Your Template</strong>: Use Canva’s intuitive tools to change colors, fonts, and add your personal or brand-specific details.</li>\n<li><strong>Download and Print</strong>: Once your card is ready, download it in your preferred format (PDF or PNG) and print it at home or through a professional printing service.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><iframe\n  src=\"https://link.proedgemarketingcrm.com/widget/form/RGu9I8sb5FXiL81X0vxI\"\n  style=\"width:100%;height:100%;border:none;border-radius:3px\"\n  id=\"inline-RGu9I8sb5FXiL81X0vxI\" \n  data-layout=\"{'id':'INLINE'}\"\n  data-trigger-type=\"alwaysShow\"\n  data-trigger-value=\"\"\n  data-activation-type=\"alwaysActivated\"\n  data-activation-value=\"\"\n  data-deactivation-type=\"neverDeactivate\"\n  data-deactivation-value=\"\"\n  data-form-name=\"Business Card Templates\"\n  data-height=\"749\"\n  data-layout-iframe-id=\"inline-RGu9I8sb5FXiL81X0vxI\"\n  data-form-id=\"RGu9I8sb5FXiL81X0vxI\"\n  title=\"Business Card Templates\"\n      ><br />\n</iframe><br />\n<script src=\"https://link.proedgemarketingcrm.com/js/form_embed.js\"></script></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">That&#8217;s A Wrap!</h2>\n<p>Investing in a personalized business card is an investment in your brand and your future success.

    "content": "<p>In this comparison of LPT vs Douglas Elliman, we will break down the key differences in commission structures, income opportunities, and resources that agents need to consider before deciding which brokerage is the best fit for their career.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Douglas Elliman</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a competitive commission split that ranges from 80/20 to 100/0, allowing agents flexibility in how much of their earnings they keep. There is no franchise or royalty fee, which makes LPT more favorable for agents looking to maximize their income. The production cap is $15K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions. LPT Realty also offers flexible monthly fee structures, ranging from $500/year plus transaction fees, or agents can opt for $89 or $149 per month, depending on their plan. Transaction fees are $195 before reaching the cap.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, on the other hand, has commission splits ranging from 50/50 to 70/30, which is significantly lower than LPT Realty’s highest splits. Additionally, Douglas Elliman charges a 6% franchise/royalty fee, which reduces agents’ overall income. The brokerage does not offer a production cap, meaning agents continue to split their commissions with the brokerage regardless of their earnings. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty fee structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers additional income opportunities through its revenue share model, allowing agents to earn passive income by recruiting new agents. LPT Realty also provides retirement income and willable income paths, making it a more attractive option for agents who want to plan for their long-term financial future.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman does not offer a revenue share program, retirement income, or willable income path. Agents at Douglas Elliman are limited to commission-based income, which may not be ideal for those looking to build additional wealth through other streams.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not offer a formal training program, but agents benefit from 24/7 support, giving them access to assistance whenever they need it, a crucial factor for agents who operate in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman provides training that varies by office, which may lead to inconsistencies in the quality and availability of training. Like LPT Realty, Douglas Elliman does not offer 24/7 agent support, meaning agents may need to rely on office resources during regular business hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty focuses on providing agents with streamlined, technology-driven tools to enhance productivity. Agents can access essential resources such as CRM systems and marketing tools to help them manage leads and optimize workflows efficiently.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, being a more traditional brokerage, offers strong branding and marketing support, especially when targeting luxury clients. However, it may not offer the same cloud-based efficiency as LPT Realty for agents looking to streamline their business in a modern way.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty holds a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars based on 37 reviews, with agents frequently praising the flexibility in commission splits and the income opportunities through the revenue share model.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, with a rating of 3.9 stars from 638 reviews, has agents who often appreciate the brand prestige but express concerns over the lower commission splits and lack of long-term financial planning options.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Douglas Elliman</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a more agent-friendly fee structure, higher commission splits, and additional income streams through its revenue share model. Its flexibility in fees and long-term financial benefits make it an attractive option for agents focused on maximizing their earnings and planning for the future.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, while prestigious and established, may be a better fit for agents working in luxury markets who value brand recognition over income opportunities. However, the lower commission splits and lack of a cap on commissions could limit earning potential.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

LPT Realty also does not charge a franchise or royalty fee, allowing agents to keep more of their earnings. The production cap is set at $15K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions. LPT’s monthly fees are flexible, with options of $0 plus $89/month or $149/month depending on the agent’s chosen plan. Transaction fees are $195 before the cap is reached.</p>\n<p>The Agency, on the other hand, has commission splits that range from 70/30 to 90/10. The brokerage charges a 6% franchise fee, which reduces an agent’s overall income. Additionally, The Agency does not offer a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split commissions with the brokerage regardless of their earnings. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the royalty structure, providing a more predictable cost, but with the absence of a cap, agents at The Agency may see reduced earnings in the long term.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a revenue share program, allowing agents to earn additional passive income by recruiting other agents to join the brokerage. This model can provide substantial additional income over time, making it an appealing choice for agents interested in team building. LPT also provides retirement and willable income paths, allowing agents to plan for their long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>The Agency does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income paths, or willable income options. Agents at The Agency are limited to their commission-based income, which may restrict long-term wealth-building potential.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty does not have structured training or 24/7 agent support, which may be a downside for newer agents or those who prefer more hands-on guidance.</p>\n<p>The Agency, like LPT, offers training that varies by office. However, there is no 24/7 agent support, meaning agents may need to rely on local office resources or colleagues for assistance outside of business hours. This lack of centralized, consistent support can be a limitation for agents seeking continuous professional development.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a cloud-based platform that provides agents with CRM systems, transaction management tools, and marketing resources to help streamline their business operations.</p>\n<p>The Agency is well-known for its high-end marketing capabilities and strong brand presence, particularly in luxury real estate. However, The Agency’s focus is more on branding and luxury marketing than on providing a modern, cloud-based tech platform like LPT Realty’s.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty has a 4.3-star rating on Glassdoor from 37 reviews, with agents highlighting the income opportunities and flexibility as key benefits.</p>\n<p>The Agency has a 4.1-star rating from 72 reviews. Agents often praise the brand’s reputation and the opportunities to work with luxury clientele, but the higher fees and lack of passive income options are noted as potential drawbacks.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-the-agency\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs The Agency</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a more flexible and financially rewarding model for agents looking for lower fees, a production cap, and passive income opportunities through revenue sharing.

    "content": "<p>This comparison between LPT vs Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices will break down the differences in commission splits, fees, income opportunities, and support systems, helping agents decide which brokerage aligns with their career goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-berkshire-hathaway\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Berkshire Hathaway</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers commission splits ranging from 80/20 to 100/0, providing agents with flexibility based on their performance and preferences. There’s no franchise or royalty fee at LPT Realty, allowing agents to retain a greater portion of their earnings. The production cap is set at $15K, and after reaching this cap, agents keep 100% of their commissions. Monthly fees at LPT Realty are low, starting at $0, plus either an $89 or $149 monthly option depending on the plan an agent selects. Transaction fees before the cap are $195, which keeps costs predictable and manageable.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway, by contrast, offers commission splits between 60/40 and 90/10. However, it charges a 6% franchise fee, which impacts the overall earnings for agents. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway doesn’t offer a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split their commissions with the brokerage indefinitely. Monthly fees at Berkshire Hathaway vary by office, and transaction fees range from $295 to $625, adding up over time, especially for high-producing agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out with its revenue share model, which allows agents to earn additional passive income by recruiting new agents. This gives agents a great opportunity to boost their earnings while growing their teams. LPT also offers retirement and willable income paths, ensuring long-term financial benefits for agents as they build their careers.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway does not offer a revenue share program, retirement income path, or willable income options. Agents are limited to earning from commissions, which may be a disadvantage for those seeking to grow wealth through multiple streams of income.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not provide formal training programs, but agents have access to 24/7 agent support, ensuring they have the help they need whenever they need it. This makes LPT Realty a good choice for self-motivated agents who are comfortable learning on their own but still want access to support.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway’s training programs vary by office, meaning the quality and availability of training are not uniform across all locations. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway does not offer 24/7 support, so agents may have to rely on local resources for assistance outside of regular business hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers agents access to modern technology and tools, including CRM systems and marketing platforms, to help them manage their businesses efficiently. LPT’s technology-driven approach gives agents the flexibility they need to succeed in today’s fast-paced real estate market.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway is a more traditional brokerage, but it does provide agents with marketing tools and resources, especially when it comes to leveraging its well-known brand. However, its technology offerings may not be as cutting-edge as LPT’s cloud-based platforms.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars based on 37 reviews, with agents appreciating the low costs, flexibility, and additional income streams offered through the revenue share program.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway has a slightly higher Glassdoor rating of 4.2 stars from 981 reviews. Agents often praise the strong brand reputation and client base, but some express concerns over the ongoing fees and lack of income opportunities beyond commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-berkshire-hathaway\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Berkshire Hathaway</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers agents more flexibility, lower costs, and the ability to earn passive income through a revenue share model, making it an attractive option for agents focused on building long-term financial stability. The 24/7 agent support and modern technology platforms further enhance its appeal.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway is a well-established brand with strong recognition, which may appeal to agents looking for the backing of a traditional, trusted name in real estate. However, the lack of a production cap, additional income streams, and higher fees might not suit agents who prioritize earning potential and cost efficiency.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

    "content": "<p>In this comparison of Fathom Realty and Redfin, the key differences come down to freedom versus structure. Fathom offers agents the opportunity to earn 100% of their commission with minimal fees, while Redfin delivers a salaried, tech-driven model with a consistent paycheck and built-in leads. These two approaches appeal to very different types of agents, and understanding how each one functions will help you decide which aligns with your long-term goals.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore what makes each brokerage unique in terms of income, fees, tech, support, and agent satisfaction—and why so many agents are exploring an entirely new kind of model that blends the best of both.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Redfin</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty gives agents full commission ownership. Agents keep 100% of their commissions, and there are no royalties or franchise fees. The annual fee is only $700, and transaction fees range from $165 to $465 depending on the chosen plan. There’s no production cap, no complicated tiers, and no surprise deductions. Errors and omissions insurance is already included, making this one of the most straightforward, cost-efficient structures in the industry.</p>\n<p>Redfin’s approach flips the model entirely. Agents are paid a salary, and instead of keeping the bulk of commissions, they receive a portion, typically between 25 and 30 percent of the total commission, while the company keeps 70 to 75 percent. Redfin doesn’t charge monthly or transaction fees, and there are no royalty fees. That sounds appealing from a predictability standpoint, but for most agents, the trade-off is clear: Redfin’s structure delivers less income potential in exchange for stability.</p>\n<p>Fathom appeals to agents who want full financial control. Redfin, on the other hand, attracts those who prioritize consistency and prefer not to worry about the ups and downs of commission-based income.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is purely commission-based. There are no additional income streams available—no revenue share, no team-building incentives, and no retirement income path. You earn based on what you sell, and when the deals stop, the income stops. This model can be incredibly rewarding for experienced agents with high production, but there’s no long-term wealth-building structure in place.</p>\n<p>Redfin offers salaried income, which includes base pay, benefits, and bonuses tied to customer satisfaction and performance. While this provides some financial predictability, it also caps the income potential. Agents aren’t rewarded for growing a team, building a business, or scaling their volume beyond a certain point. And just like Fathom, there’s no revenue share or willable income path.</p>\n<p>Neither model currently supports agents in building wealth beyond closings, which is one of the biggest reasons agents are exploring hybrid brokerages that combine commission income with stock equity, team rewards, and passive revenue streams.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty takes a hands-off approach to agent development. There is no formal training program or 24/7 support system in place. While experienced agents may not need additional education, those just starting out or transitioning into a new market may find the lack of mentorship to be a challenge. Fathom assumes you’re ready to work on your own terms, with minimal guidance or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Redfin offers a more traditional onboarding and training process. New agents participate in a structured four-week training program designed to prepare them for the company’s systems and customer service model. This training is localized and helpful for agents adjusting to new markets. However, support is limited to regular business hours, which can be frustrating during time-sensitive negotiations or urgent client issues.</p>\n<p>Agents who value freedom and self-direction tend to feel more comfortable at Fathom, while those who prefer structured onboarding and operational consistency may feel more supported at Redfin, at least in the beginning.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty does not offer a proprietary technology platform. Agents are provided with basic tools for transaction management and marketing, but the responsibility of selecting and managing CRM platforms, marketing systems, and lead generation tools falls on the agent. This makes the model ideal for independent agents who prefer to customize their own business tools—but not ideal for those who want a turnkey system out of the box.</p>\n<p>Redfin is known for its tech-forward model. The company provides agents with a centralized CRM, automated lead assignments, and high-end marketing support. Agents are not expected to generate their own leads, which is a major plus for those who don’t want to spend time prospecting. However, the trade-off is a significantly lower commission payout per deal and less control over the business-building process.</p>\n<p>If you want to own your leads and run your business your way, Fathom is the better fit. If you prefer structure, steady business, and integrated systems—while accepting lower earnings—Redfin makes sense.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty holds an impressive 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor, based on hundreds of reviews. Agents praise the transparent fee structure, the ability to keep their income, and the flexibility of the model. However, the absence of training and support is a common theme in critical reviews. Many agents enjoy the independence but caution that success at Fathom requires discipline and self-direction.</p>\n<p>Redfin has a lower 3.6-star rating on Glassdoor, based on nearly 2,000 reviews. Positive reviews highlight the leads, technology, and the benefits of a salaried structure. But a significant number of agents express frustration with the income cap, the lack of ownership over their pipeline, and a corporate environment that feels more like working for a call center than a business you own. Several reviews point out that the model can feel restrictive for entrepreneurial-minded agents.</p>\n<p>Agent satisfaction comes down to personal preference. If you value control, independence, and higher income potential, Fathom is likely a better match. If you want stability, a consistent flow of clients, and minimal administrative burden, Redfin may feel more comfortable—at least in the short term.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Redfin</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is best suited for experienced agents who want maximum control over their income and business operations. The low fees and 100% commission model are incredibly appealing for agents who have systems in place and prefer to operate independently. But for agents who need more training, leads, or support, the model may feel too hands-off.</p>\n<p>Redfin offers a structured, salaried model that prioritizes client service and lead flow over agent autonomy. It’s a better fit for agents who want a steady paycheck and value built-in systems over personal branding or long-term income growth. However, for entrepreneurial agents looking to scale or earn beyond their closings, the model feels limiting over time.</p>\n<p>If neither of these brokerages offers the balance you’re looking for, you’re not alone—and there’s a better alternative worth exploring.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n<li>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>Choosing between LPT Realty and Coldwell Banker depends on what agents prioritize in their real estate career. Both brokerages have distinct commission models, fees, and opportunities that appeal to different agent needs.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Coldwell Banker</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers agents flexible commission splits ranging from 80/20 to 100/0, which is appealing for agents who want to maximize their earnings. Additionally, there are no franchise or royalty fees, meaning agents keep more of their commissions. The production cap at LPT Realty is set at $15K, after which agents receive 100% of their commissions. Monthly fees start at $0, with options of $89 or $149 depending on the chosen plan, and transaction fees are $195 before the cap is reached.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker, in contrast, offers commission splits from 55/45 to 90/10, which are less favorable for agents compared to LPT’s 100% option. Furthermore, Coldwell Banker charges a 5-6.5% franchise or royalty fee, which cuts into an agent’s overall earnings. Coldwell Banker does not have a production cap, meaning agents are continuously subject to the split and franchise fee. Monthly fees vary by office, ranging from $150 to $179, and transaction fees are included within the royalty fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a revenue share model, which allows agents to earn additional income by recruiting others into the brokerage. This provides agents with an extra income stream that goes beyond traditional commissions. LPT also offers a retirement income path and willable income opportunities, which allow agents to build long-term financial stability.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker, on the other hand, does not provide revenue share income, retirement income, or willable income paths. This means agents are limited to earning based solely on their commission from property transactions, which could limit long-term financial growth.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers training options, though it does not provide 24/7 agent support. This can be a disadvantage for agents who prefer having access to resources and guidance at any time.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers training, but similar to LPT, the quality and availability vary by office. They also lack 24/7 agent support, meaning agents may need to rely on their local office for assistance during regular business hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides solid technological tools, with a cloud-based platform that allows agents to work efficiently and focus on their business. Agents benefit from the streamlined CRM systems and marketing resources that LPT offers.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker is also known for investing in technology, especially when it comes to brand reputation and marketing tools. However, the technological resources available may vary depending on the local office, and agents often rely on established systems for transaction management and lead generation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty holds a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 37 reviews, with agents often appreciating the flexible commission splits, revenue share model, and supportive culture.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker has a 4.3-star rating from 2.6K reviews. While many agents commend the brokerage’s brand recognition and long-standing reputation, concerns are often raised about the high fees and less favorable commission splits.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Coldwell Banker</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty is a great choice for agents who value higher commission splits, lower fees, and the opportunity to earn passive income through revenue sharing. Its straightforward cost structure and modern technology make it appealing to agents looking for flexibility and growth.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker’s strong brand and established reputation may appeal to agents seeking a traditional brokerage, but its higher fees, lower splits, and lack of income opportunities beyond commissions may limit its appeal for agents looking to maximize their earnings.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

    "content": "<p>In this comparison between LPT vs Redfin, agents will find significant differences in commission splits, income opportunities, and the type of support provided by each brokerage. Both companies have unique models that cater to different career paths and goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Redfin</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a flexible commission split structure, ranging from 80/20 to 100/0, with no franchise or royalty fee. The production cap is set at $15K, and agents also receive stock bonuses as part of their earnings, although the amount of stock is not specified. LPT Realty’s transaction fees are $195 before agents hit the cap, and their monthly fees vary depending on the agent&#8217;s plan, with options like $500/year or $149/month. This fee structure makes LPT Realty a strong contender for agents who want flexibility and ownership opportunities.</p>\n<p>Redfin, in contrast, operates with a very different model, offering commission splits that range from 30/70 to 75/25. Redfin agents do not pay a franchise or royalty fee, but they also do not have the same earning potential as LPT Realty agents. Redfin does not offer a production cap, meaning agents are always subject to the split structure. One of the unique aspects of Redfin is that agents receive a salary in addition to commission, but the relatively low splits and lack of additional income opportunities may not be attractive to agents looking to maximize their earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out for offering agents multiple streams of income, including stock bonuses, a revenue share program, and willable income paths. The revenue share program provides an extra layer of financial stability by allowing agents to earn a percentage of the commission from agents they recruit into the company. This additional income stream is a key advantage for agents seeking to build long-term wealth.</p>\n<p>Redfin does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income, or willable income. However, it provides a salary, which offers some stability for agents who prefer a more structured compensation model. While this can be appealing for newer agents or those who prioritize a steady paycheck, the lack of passive income opportunities may not be ideal for experienced agents looking to grow their wealth.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not offer structured training programs, which can be a disadvantage for newer agents who need more guidance. However, they do provide 24/7 agent support, which ensures agents can get assistance at any time.</p>\n<p>Redfin, on the other hand, has a more established training program with four weeks of local training, which can be beneficial for agents learning the ropes. However, there is no 24/7 support, which can be limiting for agents working non-traditional hours or in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers agents a range of technological tools to help streamline their business, including CRM systems and marketing platforms, though specific tools are not detailed. The company’s model focuses on giving agents the autonomy to run their businesses with modern technology at their disposal.</p>\n<p>Redfin is known for its tech-driven platform and provides agents with access to proprietary tools, lead generation, and a strong online presence. For agents who value technology and automation, Redfin’s platform can be highly appealing, but it comes at the cost of lower earnings potential.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars based on 37 reviews, where agents praise the income opportunities and flexible commission structure. However, some agents express a desire for more training and structured support.</p>\n<p>Redfin has a Glassdoor rating of 3.6 stars from 1.9K reviews. While many agents appreciate the salary structure and technology-driven model, others raise concerns about the limited income potential and relatively low commission splits.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Redfin</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides more income flexibility through its higher commission splits, revenue share program, and stock bonuses. For agents looking for long-term wealth-building opportunities and independence, LPT Realty offers more favorable options.</p>\n<p>Redfin, on the other hand, offers a salary model that provides financial stability, along with strong technological tools and leads. However, the lower commission splits and lack of additional income streams may be limiting for agents who want to maximize their earnings.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.
