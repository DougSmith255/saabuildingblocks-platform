    "content": "<p>This article will provide a comprehensive comparison between Coldwell Banker vs Keller Williams to help you determine which brokerage better aligns with your professional goals. Choosing the right brokerage is a critical decision for any real estate agent, as it significantly impacts their career trajectory and financial success.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-coldwell-banker-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Coldwell Banker vs Keller Williams</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>The commission splits and associated fees are crucial factors to consider when selecting a brokerage. Keller Williams offers flexible splits ranging from 70/30 to 100/0, with a 6% franchise/royalty fee until the cap is reached. In contrast, Coldwell Banker provides splits starting at 55/45 and going up to 90/10, with a franchise/royalty fee ranging from 5% to 6.5%.</p>\n<p>Monthly fees also differ significantly. Keller Williams’ fees vary by office, adding a layer of complexity to the cost structure. Coldwell Banker’s fees are more predictable, ranging from $150 to $179 per month, and include the royalty fee. Additionally, while Keller Williams does not charge transaction fees, Coldwell Banker includes transaction fees within their royalty fees. These differences make each brokerage unique, potentially impacting an agent&#8217;s net income and financial planning.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>The potential for additional income streams can significantly enhance an agent&#8217;s financial stability and growth. Keller Williams stands out by offering revenue share programs that provide a retirement and willable income path. These additional income streams can offer substantial long-term financial benefits and security. Conversely, Coldwell Banker does not offer such supplementary income opportunities, limiting agents primarily to their commission-based earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Effective training and support are vital for both new and experienced agents. Keller Williams excels in this area, providing extensive training opportunities, though specific details on the extent of their offerings are not standardized across all offices. Agents at Keller Williams also benefit from various support structures, although 24/7 support is not available. In contrast, Coldwell Banker provides training that varies by office and lacks the extensive and consistent support system available at Keller Williams. This difference can be crucial for agents who require ongoing assistance and professional development.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>In the modern real estate landscape, leveraging technology effectively is essential. Keller Williams is known for its robust technology platforms, offering tools that enhance productivity and client engagement. On the other hand, Coldwell Banker, while incorporating some technological tools, still focuses heavily on traditional, physical office spaces. This might appeal to agents who prefer a more conventional working environment but may not offer the same level of flexibility and innovation as Keller Williams.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Agent satisfaction is a key indicator of a brokerage’s effectiveness and overall agent happiness. Both Keller Williams and Coldwell Banker have high Glassdoor ratings of 4.3 stars, indicating strong agent approval and satisfaction. However, the volume of reviews differs significantly, with Keller Williams having 7.9K reviews compared to Coldwell Banker’s 2.6K reviews. The differences in agent satisfaction can often be attributed to the varying levels of support, training, and income opportunities provided by each brokerage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-coldwell-banker-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Coldwell Banker vs Keller Williams</h3>\n<p>In comparing <a href=\"https://www.coldwellbankerhomes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coldwell Banker</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kw.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keller Williams</a>, it’s evident that Keller Williams offers more favorable commission splits, extensive training, and additional income opportunities, making it a compelling choice for both new and experienced agents. The innovative technology and comprehensive support further enhance Keller Williams&#8217; appeal. Coldwell Banker, while offering a traditional structure with some technological integration, has higher fees and fewer income paths, which may limit its appeal to agents seeking comprehensive support and modern business solutions.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed comparison and to find the best brokerage for your needs, check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">brokerage comparison tool</a>.</p>\n<p>When making your decision, consider your specific needs and career objectives.

What&#8217;s the next move? Choosing the right brokerage can be a game-changer. Plus, it’s a decision that’s more complex than ever due to all the real estate industry disrupters.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to unpack here. Let&#8217;s kick things off by understanding the different brokerage models currently making waves.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traditional-brokerage-models\">Traditional brokerage models</h3>\n<p>Think classic franchise setup with brick-and-mortar offices where broker-owners manage recruitment. It’s the old-school way that is currently still very much in play.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"discount-traditional-brokerage-models\">Discount traditional brokerage models</h3>\n<p>Similar in vibe to traditional, but with a twist. That twist? Lower costs for clients and, yep, lower earnings for agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hybrid-brokerage-models\">Hybrid brokerage models</h3>\n<p>These guys mix it up with physical offices and tech boosts. This model aims to lower costs through tech without ditching the office vibe completely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cloud-based-brokerage-models\">Cloud-based brokerage models</h3>\n<p>The new kids on the block! These models ditch physical offices completely, cutting down middlemen and overhead. They’re all about using tech to streamline operations and empower agents like you to lead the way in recruitment.</p>\n<p>Each model has its perks, depending on what you&#8217;re looking for. The brokerage model you choose will shape your career path. Let’s make sure it’s a shape you like!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-career-advantage\">Your Career Advantage</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 63%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Before we get into the brokerage interview questions, there’s something else you should know. That is, interviewing for a real estate agent position is not like interviewing for most other jobs.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage.webp\" alt=\"Rocket flying ahead of paper airplanes, symbolizing career advantage and the importance of asking brokerage interview questions.\" class=\"wp-image-243261 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage-300x92.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage-768x235.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Why? Because you’re a revenue generator for any brokerage through your hard-earned commissions and the fees you pay to your brokerage. Additionally, most of your business expenses come out of your pocket, not your brokerages. So, unlike other jobs, real estate brokerages incur minimal costs when they bring you on board.</p>\n<p>But here’s the twist: if you&#8217;re a new agent, the time invested in training you and meeting your day-to-day questions is huge. If a brokerage isn&#8217;t hiring, or if they pass on offering you a position, it’s likely due to a lack of structured training or adequate staff to support your growth.</p>\n<p>This happens more commonly in franchise brokerages or smaller outfits. That’s because even if t the responsibility for answering your day-to-day questions often falls on just one person &#8211; the broker-owner of the franchise office. Hiring you depends on that broker’s time availability.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, this time for new agents problem is better with some cloud-based brokerages. These modern setups often have dedicated staff ready to support new agents.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at a cloud-based brokerage, the hiring process can be remarkably streamlined. Sometimes you can join the brokerage through just a simple online application, bypassing traditional interviews altogether.</p>\n<p>This makes it easier and faster to kickstart your real estate career. But, before you hit the join button, be sure to get the brokerage interview questions answered.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"evaluating-responses\">Evaluating Responses</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:55% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Evaluating-Responses.webp\" alt=\"Person looking up at a light bulb and question marks drawn on a chalkboard, representing evaluating responses to brokerage interview questions.\" class=\"wp-image-243258 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Evaluating-Responses.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Evaluating-Responses-300x116.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Evaluating-Responses-768x297.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Last, before we get to the brokerage interview questions, let&#8217;s talk about how to really listen to the answers you&#8217;ll get. It&#8217;s not just the content of the answers that matters, but also how they&#8217;re delivered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Genuine enthusiasm and openness in their responses can reveal a lot about the brokerage&#8217;s stability and their commitment to supporting your career. On the other hand, evasiveness or lack of detail can be significant red flags, signaling that the brokerage might not be the best fit for your ambitions.</p>\n<p>So listen carefully &#8211; it&#8217;s about finding a supportive environment where you can thrive, not just a place to work.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"choosing-the-right-brokerage-checklist\">Choosing the Right Brokerage Checklist</h2>\n<p>Alright, let’s get to those brokerage interview questions. Whether you’re sitting down face-to-face in a traditional brokerage office or filling out forms online for a cloud-based firm, you’ll want these answers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits\">Commission Splits</h3>\n<p>Commission splits vary widely across brokerages and they are likely to be the number one anchor to your earnings happiness.

Discount traditional brokerage models are those that discount their services and what agents earn. Hybrid brokerage models mix it up with physical offices and tech boosts to lower costs. Cloud-based brokerage models ditch physical offices completely, cutting down middlemen and overhead. They’re all about using tech to streamline operations.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">How is interviewing as a real estate agent different than other professions?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">It’s different because agents generate revenue for the brokerage through commissions while paying fees and most business expenses themselves, minimizing costs for the brokerage. However, the time investment in training new agents and addressing daily inquiries is substantial. Cloud-based brokerages better accommodate new agents with dedicated support staff and streamlined hiring processes, sometimes allowing agents to join through a simple online application, eliminating traditional interviews.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"rank-math-faq-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question\">What real estate brokerage interview questions should I ask?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer\">Ask about commission splits, fees, training, technology, lead generation, marketing support, stock rewards, mentorship, networking opportunities, company culture, and agent perks like: healthcare, retirement plans, and recruiting bonuses. Also ask how much the company innovates, how profitable is the company after expenses, and are their client perks like global advertising or renovations where the associated costs are zero until closing.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

This comprehensive guide on how to obtain a California real estate license will walk you through each step, ensuring you’re well-prepared to start your real estate career in California. Let’s get started on your journey to becoming a licensed real estate agent.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#basic-requirements\">Understand the Basic Requirements</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-1\">Step 1: Take a Real Estate Pre-Licensing Course</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-2\">Step 2: Submit Your California Real Estate License Application</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-3\">Step 3: Pass the California Real Estate Exam</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-4\">Step 4: Complete the Fingerprinting Requirement</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-5\">Step 5: Submit the Salesperson License Application</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#step-6\">Step 6: Find a Real Estate Broker to Sponsor You</a></li>\n<li class=\"\"><a href=\"#find-a-sponsoring-broker\">Find a Sponsoring Broker</a></li>\n</ol>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"basic-requirements\">Understand the Basic Requirements</h2>\n<p>Before diving into the specifics, it’s essential to understand the basic requirements for a California real estate license. These are the fundamental criteria you must meet:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Age Requirement</h3>\n<p>You must be at least 18 years old to apply for a real estate license in California. This age requirement ensures that applicants have reached a level of maturity and legal responsibility necessary for the profession.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Residency and Identification</h3>\n<p>While you don’t need to be a California resident to obtain a license, you must have a Social Security number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). This identification is crucial for background checks and to ensure compliance with state regulations. Out-of-state applicants for a California real estate license must meet the same criteria as California residents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Honesty and Integrity</h3>\n<p>You must be honest and truthful in all your dealings. The California Department of Real Estate (DRE) will conduct a thorough background check, and any conviction of a crime may result in the denial of your license. Being upfront about any past legal issues and demonstrating rehabilitation can positively impact your application.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-1\">Step 1: Take a Real Estate Pre-Licensing Course</h2>\n<p>In California, you need to complete <strong>135 hours of real estate pre-licensing education</strong>. This course covers essential topics like real estate principles, practices, and legal aspects.</p>\n<p><em>“Any real estate practice course submitted for purposes of qualifying to take a real estate license exam, must include components on implicit bias and fair housing. Additionally, the fair housing component must include an interactive participatory component where the applicant role plays as both the consumer and the real estate professional.” <a href=\"https://www.dre.ca.gov/Examinees/RequirementsSales.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">-DRE</a></em></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Course Breakdown</h3>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Real Estate Principles (45 hours)</h4>\n<p>This course covers the fundamentals of real estate, including property ownership, land use controls, and regulations. Understanding these principles is essential for anyone entering the real estate field.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Real Estate Practice (45 hours)</h4>\n<p>Real Estate Practice focuses on the practical aspects of working as a real estate agent. Topics include listing agreements, sales processes, and client relationships. This course prepares you for the day-to-day activities you will encounter in your real estate career.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Elective Course (45 hours)</h4>\n<p>The elective course allows you to specialize in an area of interest, such as Real Estate Finance, Real Estate Appraisal, or Property Management. Choosing an elective that aligns with your career goals can provide a competitive edge.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing the Right School</h3>\n<p>Selecting the right California real estate school is crucial. Look for accredited schools that offer flexibility, especially if you have a busy schedule. Online real estate courses in California can provide the convenience of studying at your own pace.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Schools:</strong> Start by researching various California real estate schools and reading reviews from past students. Look for schools with high pass rates for the real estate exam and positive feedback on their teaching methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider Online vs. In-Person:</strong> Decide whether you prefer online or in-person real estate classes in California. Online courses offer flexibility and convenience, allowing you to study at your own pace. In-person classes provide direct interaction with instructors and peers, which can enhance your learning experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluate Course Materials:</strong> Evaluate the course materials and support services provided by the school. High-quality textbooks, interactive lessons, and access to instructors for questions can significantly impact your success. Some schools also offer additional resources like exam prep courses and study groups.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Study Tips</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create a daily study schedule that covers all exam topics, ensuring regular review sessions. (<a href=\"https://asana.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Asana provides a great FREE task manager</a>)</li>\n<li>Utilize flashcards for key terms and concepts to enhance memorization.

Regularly checking the status can help you stay informed about any issues or additional requirements.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-3\">Step 3: Pass the California Real Estate Exam</h2>\n<p>The exam is a 3-hour test with 150 multiple-choice questions. You need to score at least 70% to pass. Each attempt requires a new application and a fee of $60.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exam Topics</h3>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Property Ownership and Land Use Controls and Regulations (approximately 15%)</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Classes of Property</li>\n<li>Property Characteristics</li>\n<li>Encumbrances</li>\n<li>Types of Ownership</li>\n<li>Descriptions of Property</li>\n<li>Government Rights in Land</li>\n<li>Public Controls</li>\n<li>Environmental Hazards and Regulations</li>\n<li>Private Controls</li>\n<li>Water Rights</li>\n<li>Special Categories of Land</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Laws of Agency and Fiduciary Duties (approximately 17%)</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Law, Definition and Nature of Agency Relationships, Types of Agencies, and Agents</li>\n<li>Creation of Agency and Agency Agreements</li>\n<li>Responsibilities of Agent to Seller/Buyer as Principal</li>\n<li>Disclosure of Agency</li>\n<li>Disclosure of Acting as Principal or Other Interest</li>\n<li>Termination of Agency</li>\n<li>Commission and Fees</li>\n<li>Responsibilities of Agent to Non-Client Third Parties</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Property Valuation and Financial Analysis (approximately 14%)</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Value</li>\n<li>Methods of Estimating Value</li>\n<li>Financial Analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Financing (approximately 9%)</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>General Concepts</li>\n<li>Types of Loans</li>\n<li>Sources of Financing</li>\n<li>Government Programs</li>\n<li>Mortgages/Deeds of Trust/Notes</li>\n<li>Financing/Credit Laws</li>\n<li>Loan Brokerage</li>\n<li>Types of Loan Originators</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transfer of Property (approximately 8%)</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Title Insurance</li>\n<li>Deeds</li>\n<li>Escrow</li>\n<li>Tax Aspects</li>\n<li>Special Processes</li>\n<li>Transfer through Court Supervision</li>\n<li>Types of Vesting</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Practice of Real Estate and Disclosures (approximately 25%)</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Trust Account Management</li>\n<li>Fair Housing Laws</li>\n<li>Truth in Advertising</li>\n<li>Record Keeping Requirements</li>\n<li>Agency Supervision</li>\n<li>Permitted Activities of Unlicensed Sales Assistants</li>\n<li>DRE Jurisdiction and Disciplinary Actions</li>\n<li>Licensing, and Continuing Education Requirements and Procedures</li>\n<li>California Real Estate Recovery Fund</li>\n<li>General Ethics</li>\n<li>Technology</li>\n<li>Property Management</li>\n<li>Commercial/Industrial/Income Properties</li>\n<li>Specialty Areas</li>\n<li>Transfer Disclosure Statement</li>\n<li>Natural Hazard Disclosure Statements</li>\n<li>Disclosure of Material Facts Affecting Property Value</li>\n<li>Need for Inspection and Obtaining/Verifying Information</li>\n<li>Reports</li>\n<li>Servicing Diverse Populations</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contracts (approximately 12%)</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>General</li>\n<li>Listing Agreements</li>\n<li>Buyer Broker Agreements</li>\n<li>Offers/Purchase Contracts</li>\n<li>Agreements</li>\n<li>Promissory Notes/Securities</li>\n<li>Purchase/Lease Options</li>\n<li>Advanced Fee</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exam Preparation Tips</h3>\n<p><strong>Review Course Materials:</strong> Go over the textbooks and notes from your pre-license courses. Revisiting these materials can reinforce your understanding of key concepts. Focus on areas where you feel less confident to ensure a well-rounded preparation.</p>\n<p><strong>Take Practice Exams:</strong> Take as many practice exams as possible. This helps you get familiar with the exam format and identify areas where you need more study. (<a href=\"https://realestatelicensewizard.com/california-real-estate-practice-exam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free California Real Estate Practice Exam</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Join Study Groups:</strong> Join or form study groups. Discussing topics with peers can enhance understanding and retention. Study groups provide a platform to share knowledge, ask questions, and support each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Consider Exam Prep Courses:</strong> Consider enrolling in an exam prep course for additional support and structured study. These courses often include practice exams, study guides, and expert instruction.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tips for Exam Day</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Arrive Early:</strong> Ensure you arrive at the exam center early to avoid any last-minute stress. Check the location and travel time in advance.</li>\n<li><strong>Bring Valid ID:</strong> You’ll need a valid photo ID to enter the exam. Make sure your ID is current and matches the name on your application.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay Calm:</strong> Read each question carefully and manage your time wisely. Staying calm and composed can help you think clearly and avoid mistakes.</li>\n<li><strong>Follow Instructions:</strong> Follow all instructions given by the exam proctors. If you have any questions or issues, ask the proctors for assistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-4\">Step 4: Complete the Fingerprinting Requirement</h2>\n<p>After passing the exam, you must complete a fingerprinting requirement for a background check. This is a mandatory step to ensure you meet the honesty and integrity standards set by the DRE.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Live Scan Process</h3>\n<p><strong>Find a Provider:</strong> Use a Live Scan service provider approved by the California Department of Justice. Live Scan is an electronic fingerprinting process that is fast and secure. Locate a service provider near you and schedule an appointment. (You can get this done at UPS for $65)</p>\n<p><strong>Submit Required Forms:</strong> Fill out and submit the RE Form 237 (<a href=\"https://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/forms/re237.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">click here</a>) along with the fingerprinting fee. The Live Scan service provider will electronically transmit your fingerprints to the Department of Justice. Keep a copy of the form and receipt for your records.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay the Fee:</strong> Be prepared to pay the fingerprinting fee, which varies by provider. The fee typically includes the cost of the Live Scan service and the background check. Confirm the total cost when scheduling your appointment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background Check</h3>\n<p>The DRE will conduct a background check using your fingerprints. This check ensures you meet the honesty and integrity standards required for a real estate license. Any issues identified during the background check may need to be addressed before your license is granted.</p>\n<p>If any issues arise during the background check, be prepared to provide additional documentation or explanations. Demonstrating honesty and taking responsibility for past actions can positively impact the DRE’s decision. Seek legal advice if necessary to navigate any complex issues.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-5\">Step 5: Submit the Salesperson License Application</h2>\n<p>The next step is to submit the Salesperson License Application. This application confirms that you have passed the exam and completed the fingerprinting requirement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Application Process</h3>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complete the Form:</strong> Fill out the form available on the <a href=\"https://www.dre.ca.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DRE website</a>. Ensure all sections are completed accurately.</li>\n<li><strong>Include Exam Results:</strong> Include proof that you passed the exam. This documentation is crucial for the DRE to verify your eligibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Attach Live Scan Form:</strong> Attach your Live Scan Service form. This proof confirms that you have completed the fingerprinting requirement.</li>\n<li><strong>Pay the Fee:</strong> As of 2023, the fee is $245. This fee must be submitted along with your application.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After submitting your application, you can track its status online through the DRE’s website. Regularly checking the status can help you stay informed about any updates or additional requirements.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-6\">Step 6: Find a Real Estate Broker to Sponsor You</h2>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"find-a-sponsoring-broker\">Find a Sponsoring Broker</h2>\n<p>Once you pass the exam, you need to find a sponsoring broker to activate your license. Look for a brokerage that aligns with your goals and offers the support you need.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Look for in a Brokerage</h3>\n<p><strong>Culture and Environment:</strong> Find a supportive and collaborative environment. The right culture can significantly impact your job satisfaction and success.</p>\n<p><strong>Commission Structure:</strong> Understand the financial arrangements. Different brokerages offer different commission splits, so choose one that suits your financial goals.</p>\n<p><strong>Training and Support:</strong> Choose a broker who provides ample training and mentorship opportunities. Early career support is crucial for your development and success.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Questions to Ask During Interviews</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What training programs do you offer for new agents?</li>\n<li>How does your commission split work, and are there any additional fees?</li>\n<li>What kind of support and resources will I have access to?</li>\n<li>Can you provide references from other agents in your brokerage?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more interview preparation, check out our guide on <a href=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/brokerage-interview-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">17 Brokerage Interview Questions</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Top Brokerages to Consider</h3>\n<p>Choosing the right broker is crucial as it impacts your early career significantly.

Hint: it’s not cheap to start out in real estate.</p>\n<p>Starting a career in real estate across the U.S. involves several initial expenses and requires careful financial planning. Here’s a breakdown of typical costs and planning tips:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Starting Costs</h3>\n<p><strong>1. Initial Expenses</strong>: Includes licensing fees, marketing expenses, office supplies, and technology tools. Typical costs might be:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pre-Licensing Course</strong>: $99-$700</li>\n<li><strong>Exam Fee</strong>: $60 per attempt</li>\n<li><strong>Application Fee</strong>: $245</li>\n<li><strong>Fingerprinting Fee</strong>: Approximately $60</li>\n<li><strong>Marketing Materials</strong>: Costs for business cards, signage, and online advertising</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Professional Memberships</strong>:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>National Association of Realtors (NAR)</strong>: Annual dues approximately $156, plus a $45 special assessment for the Consumer Advertising Campaign, totaling around $201.</li>\n<li><strong>State and Local Associations</strong>: Membership fees can vary. Typically, local Realtor association fees range from $200 to $300 annually.<strong>Multiple Listing Service (MLS)</strong>: Fees can vary significantly by region. Generally, expect to pay anywhere from $300 to $500 annually.<strong>Supra Key Fees</strong>: Include an initial setup fee and a monthly or annual service fee, generally around $50 for setup and $20 to $25 per month for service.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Budgeting Tips</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Create a Budget</strong>: Track expenses and forecast income, planning for slower months to maintain financial stability.</li>\n<li><strong>Emergency Fund</strong>: Set aside funds to cover unexpected costs or slow periods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Income Management</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commission Structure</strong>: Real estate agents earn through sales commissions. Commission splits vary widely, typically from 50/50 to 80/20 or higher, depending on the brokerage.</li>\n<li><strong>Tax Planning</strong>: As an independent contractor, keep track of deductible expenses, make estimated tax payments, and maintain good records. Consult a tax professional to ensure compliance and optimize tax strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These estimates are subject to change and can vary by location and specific circumstances. Always check local regulations and consult with local Realtor associations for the most accurate and up-to-date information.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-get-a-real-estate-license\">How to get a Real Estate License – Basic Requirements</h2>\n<p>Generally, all states require a high school diploma or equivalent, U.S. citizenship, proof of state residency, and completion of state-approved pre-licensing courses. Additionally, many states mandate a background check and may require proof of errors and omissions insurance.</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Age</strong>: Most states require applicants to be at least 18 years old. Some states, like New York, require applicants to be at least 20 years old to become a broker.</li>\n<li><strong>Education</strong>: A high school diploma or equivalent is typically required. Additionally, applicants must complete state-approved pre-licensing courses, which cover real estate principles, laws, and practices. The number of required hours varies by state, ranging from 40 to 180 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Residency</strong>: Applicants must be permanent residents of the state in which they are applying for the license.</li>\n<li><strong>Background Check</strong>: Most states require a criminal background check to ensure the applicant has no disqualifying criminal history.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre-Licensing Education</strong>: Completion of pre-licensing education is mandatory. The specific number of hours and the content of these courses depend on state regulations. For example, New York requires 77 hours of coursework for agents and 152 hours for brokers.</li>\n<li><strong>Examination</strong>: Applicants must pass a state licensing exam that tests their knowledge of real estate laws, practices, and principles. The exam typically includes both national and state-specific sections.</li>\n<li><strong>Sponsorship</strong>: In some states, like New York, applicants must be sponsored by a licensed real estate broker to activate their license.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additional Considerations</h3>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>License Reciprocity</strong>: Some states have reciprocity agreements with other states, which can simplify the licensing process for those already licensed elsewhere. This may allow applicants to skip certain pre-licensing requirements but still necessitates passing state-specific portions of the exam.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuing Education</strong>: After obtaining a license, most states require real estate professionals to complete continuing education courses to maintain their license and stay updated on industry changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Time-to-get-license.webp\" alt=\"How to get a real estate license - Basic Requirements\" class=\"wp-image-242978\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>On average, it takes about 4-6 months to get a real estate license through traditional classroom courses.

Sure, commission splits are a huge part of it, but the resources, training, support, and even the day-to-day experience you’ll have as an agent are equally important.</p>\n<p>Picking the right brokerage means finding the one that fits your style, goals, and needs—and of course, helps you maximize your income.</p>\n<p>Today, we’re comparing eXp Realty and Corcoran, two widely recognized real estate brands. While eXp Realty is known for its transparency, you might have to dig deeper for some of the details on Corcoran, but no worries—we’ve done the homework for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248044\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp\" alt=\"a yellow ball with a face\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Agent-Satisfaction-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Agent Satisfaction</h2>\n<p>One key way to gauge how happy you’ll be at a brokerage is by checking out agent satisfaction. According to <strong>Glassdoor</strong>, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> holds a fantastic <strong>4.6-star rating</strong>, while <strong>Corcoran</strong> isn’t far behind with <strong>4.4 stars</strong>.</p>\n<p>Both companies clearly have satisfied agents, but it’s important to think about why. This can come down to support, resources, and overall company culture. And we all know that happier agents tend to be more successful agents.</p>\n<p>If you’re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why does profitability matter? Because a financially stable brokerage can keep offering you great tools, training, and support without cutting corners. When a brokerage is in the red, it’s not uncommon for agents to feel the pinch.</p>\n<p><strong>Corcoran</strong> is part of Anywhere Real Estate, a large holding company that also includes brands like Sotheby’s, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Century 21, and Coldwell Banker. As a group, Anywhere has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong> with <strong>12 quarters of profits</strong>, which leaves them with <strong>60% profitable </strong>quarters. While that’s not terrible, it’s not the most financially secure either.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>, which puts them at <strong>75% profitability</strong>. And here’s the kicker—<strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that’s been profitable for the past five years</strong>.</p>\n<p>That financial stability means continued improvements for both agents and clients, with no surprises or cost-cutting moves that hurt your bottom line. If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>When it comes to commission splits, this is where agents often pay the most attention. After all, it’s what determines how much of your hard-earned money stays in your pocket.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Corcoran</strong>, agents face some of the lowest commission splits in the industry, with splits ranging from <strong>50/50</strong> &#8211; <strong>70/30</strong>. For those unfamiliar with splits, this means you could be giving half of your commission back to the brokerage, depending on the deal you negotiate. It ties with Douglas Elliman for one of the lowest splits out there.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> offers one of the most agent-friendly commission structures in the industry. All agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you’ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage for the year, you cap and move to <strong>100% commission</strong>—meaning everything after that is yours to keep.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp rewards agents with stock for hitting certain milestones, and if you meet even more goals, you can get your <strong>$16,000 cap</strong> <strong>back</strong> in company stock. Bottom line, eXp Agents can earn more than 100% of their commission and it’s transparent and the same for every agent, no matter their location or experience.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Let’s talk about E&#038;O insurance, which is critical for protecting both you and your brokerage from legal claims. At <strong>Corcoran</strong>, it’s tough to get specifics on E&#038;O insurance. Agents have described it as <strong>“high,”</strong> so it’s worth checking with your local office to find out what you’ll be expected to pay.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> makes <strong>E&#038;O insurance</strong> easy and affordable. You pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but only when you close a deal. And once you hit <strong>$750</strong> for the year, <strong>you’re capped</strong> and done paying for E&#038;O. That’s a huge relief for agents, especially if you’re just starting out and don’t want to deal with big upfront fees before you’ve even closed your first deal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Fees</h2>\n<p>Next up, let’s dive into <strong>fees</strong>, because no one wants to be surprised by extra costs that eat into their earnings. At <strong>Corcoran</strong>, <strong>monthly fees vary</strong> significantly by office, and agents also pay a <strong>6% royalty fee per transaction</strong>. That royalty fee adds up quickly and can really cut into your commission.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong>, on the other hand, keeps things straightforward. Agents pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until they hit their cap. The simplicity and predictability of these fees make eXp Realty a much more cost-effective choice for agents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you’re a new agent or a seasoned pro, having access to the right <strong>training and support</strong> is critical to your success. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training is top-notch. You get access to <strong>over 50 live training sessions</strong> every week, as well as an <strong>on-demand library</strong> full of helpful resources.</p>\n<p>Plus, new agents can take part in the <strong>Fast Start</strong> program to get up and running quickly, while experienced agents can level up with the <strong>Kick Start</strong> program. And with <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong>, you’ll never be left without help when you need it.</p>\n<p>Over at <strong>Corcoran</strong>, training and support <strong>vary by office</strong>. The level of support you receive depends heavily on your local broker, so if you’re in an office with less training or a less available broker, you may find yourself without the resources you need when it counts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>technology and resources</strong>, staying ahead of the curve can be a game-changer for agents. <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is all about leveraging tech to give agents the best tools.</p>\n<p>As a <strong>fully virtual brokerage</strong>, eXp agents can do everything online, from meeting with their broker to attending training sessions. The <strong>eXp World</strong> platform is like a metaverse for agents, allowing them to collaborate and work together in real time. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>On top of that, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> provides each agent with their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a powerful <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a marketing center filled with customizable templates for social media, flyers, and more.</p>\n<p>Details on <strong>Corcoran’s tech</strong> offerings are a bit more elusive. While they’ve built a solid brand, especially in luxury real estate, there’s no clear information on whether they offer the same kind of comprehensive tech tools that <strong>eXp Realty</strong> does. If cutting-edge technology is a must-have for you, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> seems to be the better bet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-corcoran-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Corcoran May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>Let’s be real—Corcoran does have a lot to offer, especially if you’re an agent who prefers working in an office and enjoys having a nearby person to check up on you and make sure you’re on track.  In that case, your local Corcoran office might feel like home.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, if it’s just that you don’t want to work at home, <strong>eXp Realty does offer FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide. </strong>But, if you’re the type who needs daily interaction and face-to-face accountability to stay on track, eXp’s virtual model might not be the best fit for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp’s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don’t provide. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents—how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there’s eXp’s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp’s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there’s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. The best part? That income doesn’t end when you retire and it’s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you’re no longer working. Now that’s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>When comparing <a href=\"https://join.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty</a> to Corcoran, it’s clear that eXp Realty stands out with its transparent commission splits, lower fees, and unparalleled support and technology. Corcoran is a solid choice for agents who value the branding and prefer a traditional office-based model, but when it comes to overall value and flexibility, eXp Realty has the upper hand.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

We’re digging into 8 publicly traded real estate brokerage stocks—that’s roughly 15 well-known companies wrapped up into 3 different business models. Yeah, it’s a lot. But we’re not here to bore you with stock market fluff.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This isn’t about stock prices or Wall Street vibes. It’s about performance—real-world, boots-on-the-ground results. We’re looking at how these brokerages held up before COVID, during the absolute chaos of the 2021–2022 buying frenzy, and through the market slump that followed.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"501\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Supercharge-Your-Marketing-No-Tech-Skills-Needed.webp\" alt=\"Supercharge Your Marketing (No Tech Skills Needed)\" class=\"wp-image-266618 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Supercharge-Your-Marketing-No-Tech-Skills-Needed.webp 501w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Supercharge-Your-Marketing-No-Tech-Skills-Needed-300x162.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>By focusing on the past five years of balance sheets, not crystal balls or analyst daydreams, we’ll show you which top real estate companies are actually built to last. Because at the end of the day, profitability isn’t just a flex—it directly impacts your wallet, your tools, and your future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-estate-brokerage-profitability\">Real Estate Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Here’s why profitability matters: broke brokerages break agents. Period. If your brokerage isn’t turning a profit, it won’t take long before the pain trickles down to you.</p>\n<p>Resources &#038; Tools? Nope. When the money’s not there, neither are the upgrades. That shiny CRM or slick marketing platform? Yeah, you can forget about it.</p>\n<p>Stability? Don’t count on it. Unprofitable brokerages are more likely to shut down, rebrand, or throw you into some clunky system mid-transaction while they scramble to stay afloat. Nothing says “confidence killer” like telling a client your brokerage just laid off half its staff.</p>\n<p>Your Commission? At risk. A brokerage that’s bleeding cash only has a few plays: jack up agent fees, slash your split, or both. Why? Because agents are the revenue. If things go south, you’re the piggy bank.</p>\n<p>Every top real estate brokerage company lives or dies by agent transactions. But how they manage expenses, leverage tech, and weather market shifts makes all the difference. The most profitable real estate brokerage isn’t just surviving—it’s setting its agents up to win.</p>\n<p>If you want to compare brokerage commissions or fees, check out <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/traditional/\">our traditional brokerage comparison charts</a>.</p>\n<p>So let’s break down who’s winning, who’s limping along, and who’s one bad quarter away from full-on panic mode.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Top-Real-Estate-Companies-5-Year-Profitability-Net-EPS-Performance-Comparison.webp\" alt=\"Bar charts comparing 5-year profitability (positive values) and Net EPS trends (including negative values) for real estate companies: eXp Realty, RE/MAX, Anywhere, Douglas Elliman, Redfin, Fathom Realty, and Real Compass Brokerages\" class=\"wp-image-267041\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Top-Real-Estate-Companies-5-Year-Profitability-Net-EPS-Performance-Comparison.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Top-Real-Estate-Companies-5-Year-Profitability-Net-EPS-Performance-Comparison-300x179.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Top-Real-Estate-Companies-5-Year-Profitability-Net-EPS-Performance-Comparison-768x458.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-estate-brokerage-models\">Real Estate Brokerage Models</h2>\n<p>The real estate industry isn’t exactly known for staying ahead of the curve—but lately, brokerage models have been evolving faster than your clients ghost you after an open house. Let’s break down the four main types of real estate brokerage companies shaking up the scene:</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional brokerages</strong> are your classic franchise operations—brick-and-mortar offices, lots of middle managers, and a whole recruitment hierarchy that screams “corporate.” Think Coldwell Banker or Century 21. Reliable? Maybe. Efficient? Not so much.</p>\n<p><strong>Discount traditional brokerages</strong> are the same setup, just with thinner margins. Lower prices for clients mean thinner commissions for you. Yay?</p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid brokerages</strong> blend traditional setups with modern tech tools. You’ll still find offices and regional managers, but they’re at least trying to bring costs down with digital platforms and smarter systems. Compass is a good example here—trying to play both sides.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud-based brokerages</strong> are the disruptors. No offices. No bloated staff. No middlemen taking a cut before you see your commission. These lean, tech-driven models—like eXp Realty, Fathom, and Real—use virtual tools and smart systems to cut expenses and boost agent value. When done right, they can offer high splits, low fees, and way more reinvestment into agent tools. For a deeper look at the advantages of modern models like eXp, check out what <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/brokerage-fee/\">eXp agents get for their brokerage fees</a>.</p>\n<p>Bottom line? The most profitable real estate brokerage is usually the one that figured out how to stop lighting money on fire just to keep the lights on.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-comparison-selection\">Brokerage Comparison Selection</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s talk about how we picked our players. We’re only looking at top real estate brokerages in the USA that are publicly traded. Why? Because if a company isn’t willing to show its financials, we’re not going to pretend it’s doing fine just because it slapped “#1” in its marketing.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"306\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage.webp\" alt=\"Rocket flying ahead of paper airplanes, symbolizing career advantage and the importance of asking brokerage interview questions.\" class=\"wp-image-243261 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage-300x92.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Your-Career-Advantage-768x235.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Public companies offer transparency—actual numbers, real earnings, and no fairy dust.

Even if your company isn’t on the list, there’s a good chance one of these is its financial doppelgänger.

We’re using EPS (earnings per share) to measure this because EPS tells us exactly how much profit—or pain—a company is generating after all expenses are accounted for. No smoke, no mirrors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>We reviewed 20 quarters (that’s five years of receipts) and ranked each brokerage from worst to best based on how many of those quarters they actually made money. To keep it real, we also included each company’s cumulative net gain or loss over that time.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"284\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/From-Launch-to-Leadership.webp\" alt=\"top real estate companies, From Launch to Leadership\" class=\"wp-image-266548 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/From-Launch-to-Leadership.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/From-Launch-to-Leadership-300x170.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>Quick heads up: a tiny brokerage might look better on paper simply because its losses are smaller in dollar terms. That’s why we’re focusing on the percentage of profitable quarters first and using total EPS net gain/loss as a secondary measure.</p>\n<p>Basically, who’s making money most consistently—and who’s just hoping the next quarter is “the one.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"number-8-the-biggest-loser-compass\">Number 8 – The Biggest Loser: Compass</h3>\n<p>Coming in dead last is Compass, our hybrid model darling that’s been all style, no substance. Over the past 20 quarters, Compass hasn’t posted a single profitable one. Zero. Zilch. A perfect 0-for-20 streak that even the worst sports teams would be ashamed of.</p>\n<p>Its total net EPS loss? A staggering -13.18 per share—nearly twice as bad as the next-lowest performer. That’s not a little off-track—that’s “took the wrong train entirely.”</p>\n<p>To be fair, the bleeding <em>might</em> be slowing. But if your business plan involves &#8220;losing less money over time,&#8221; you might want to revisit that pitch deck.</p>\n<p>Here’s a chart of how that all played out:</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"718\" height=\"409\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6.png\" alt=\"Top Real estate companies, Line graph showing Compass, Inc.&#039;s Earnings Per Share (EPS) trends from July 2020 to January 2025, comparing Basic Annual, Diluted Annual, Basic Quarterly, and Diluted Quarterly metrics.

That’s right, 100% unprofitable over five years.</p>\n<p>Now, Real does have one thing going for it: it’s smaller. So the total damage is only -$0.56 per share, which looks way less scary than Compass’s jaw-dropper. But before you breathe a sigh of relief—don’t.</p>\n<p>While Compass started off with massive losses that <em>might</em> be shrinking, Real did the opposite. Their losses started small and snowballed into a full-on disaster. And while things <em>may</em> be stabilizing a bit, the trend hasn’t exactly turned the corner.</p>\n<p>So far, Real’s financial strategy looks like: “Let’s burn through capital, hope for hockey stick growth, and figure out profit… later?” Bold. But not great if you’re an agent looking for a stable home.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"737\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-1.png\" alt=\"Top Real estate companies, Line graph depicting The Real Brokerage Inc.&#039;s Earnings Per Share (EPS) trends from January 2021 to January 2025, showing Basic Annual, Diluted Annual, Basic Quarterly, and Diluted Quarterly metrics.

Out of 20 quarters, they’ve managed to turn a profit exactly once—which means they’re 95% unprofitable.</p>\n<p>For a lean, tech-powered company, that’s&#8230; impressive in the worst way.</p>\n<p>The one winning quarter? So small it’s basically a rounding error. Meanwhile, the losses? Huge. The chart might as well be a ski slope. With a total net EPS loss of -5.28 per share, Fathom’s financials are steep—and not in the “we’re growing fast” kind of way.</p>\n<p>Even if the worst of the losses are behind them (and that’s a big “if”), the road to profitability looks long, bumpy, and uphill both ways.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"747\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image.png\" alt=\"Bar chart showing Fathom Holdings Inc.&#039;s basic and diluted EPS, both annual and quarterly, from July 2020 to January 2025, sourced from Fintel.io.\" class=\"wp-image-267004\" style=\"width:823px;height:auto\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image.png 747w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"number-5-redfin-discount-brokerage-premium-losses\">Number 5 – Redfin: Discount Brokerage, Premium Losses</h3>\n<p>Next up is Redfin, our token traditional discount brokerage—and let’s just say the discount extends to their profits too. Out of 20 quarters, Redfin has posted losses in 17 of them, which makes them 85% unprofitable.</p>\n<p>Their total net EPS loss? A solid -6.94 per share. Not great for a company that was once hyped as a tech-forward disruptor set to revolutionize the industry.</p>\n<p>Instead of shaking things up, Redfin’s been quietly shaking out cash. To be fair, their losses are trending lower, which is basically the financial equivalent of “it’s not as bad as it used to be.” But hey—when your business model is built around charging less, you&#8217;d better have the math dialed in. So far, it seems like they don’t.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"732\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7.png\" alt=\"Bar chart displaying Redfin Corporation&#039;s annual and quarterly basic and diluted EPS from July 2020 to January 2025, with negative earnings highlighted in 2022 and 2023.\" class=\"wp-image-267011\" style=\"width:823px;height:auto\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7.png 732w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-7-300x176.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"number-4-douglas-elliman-not-the-worst-but-not-great\">Number 4 – Douglas Elliman: Not the Worst, But Not Great</h3>\n<p>Coming in at number four is Douglas Elliman, with 16 quarters of data and 6 profitable quarters, making them 62.5% unprofitable overall. Not as brutal as some of the others, but still not exactly a victory lap.</p>\n<p>Now, since it’s a smaller company, the total net loss is just -$0.31 per share over five years—basically a rounding error compared to the dumpster fires above. But don’t let the low dollar amount fool you.</p>\n<p>The trend? Still sliding in the wrong direction.

With that many brand names under one roof, you’d hope some economies of scale would kick in—and to their credit, they kinda do.</p>\n<p>Out of 20 quarters, Anywhere has managed 13 profitable quarters, giving them a 35% unprofitable rate and a 65% profitability rate. Not bad for a legacy model.</p>\n<p>But here’s the rub: the bad quarters are <em>really</em> bad. Their total net EPS loss clocks in at -$4.94, which shows that when things go south, they don’t just stumble—they tumble.</p>\n<p>So while they’re winning more than they’re losing, the scoreboard still shows red overall. Big reach, big names, big losses.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"745\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3.png\" alt=\"Bar chart of Anywhere Real Estate Inc.’s basic and diluted EPS, both annual and quarterly, from July 2020 to January 2025, showing strong gains until 2022 and sharp declines in 2023.\" class=\"wp-image-267007\" style=\"width:823px;height:auto\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3.png 745w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3-300x171.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"number-2-re-max-respectable-but-still-in-the-red\">Number 2 – RE/MAX: Respectable, But Still in the Red</h3>\n<p>Snagging the runner-up spot is RE/MAX, one of the more familiar faces in the traditional brokerage world. With 13 profitable quarters out of 20, they match Anywhere’s 65% profitability rate—not too shabby for an old-school model.</p>\n<p>But while they edge out Anywhere with a slightly better net EPS loss of -$3.43 per share, they still haven’t broken even over five years. And when RE/MAX has a bad quarter? It’s <em>bad</em>. The chart shows those downturns hit like a freight train.</p>\n<p>So yes, they’ve been a solid performer in their category—but let’s not confuse “second-best” with “profitable.” They’re still losing money overall… just a little more gracefully.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"731\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-5.png\" alt=\"Top Real estate companies, Bar chart showing RE/MAX Holdings, Inc.’s annual and quarterly EPS (basic and diluted) from July 2020 to January 2025, highlighting a major earnings drop in late 2023.\" class=\"wp-image-267009\" style=\"width:823px;height:auto\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-5.png 731w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-5-300x142.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"number-1-e-xp-realty-the-only-one-in-the-green\">Number 1 – eXp Realty: The Only One in the Green</h3>\n<p>Taking the top spot by a mile is eXp Realty, the only brokerage on this list that can confidently say, “We made money.” Out of 20 quarters, 15 were profitable, giving eXp a 75% profitability rate.</p>\n<p>But here’s the real mic-drop moment: eXp is the <em>only</em> publicly traded real estate brokerage to post a net gain over the past five years, with a cumulative EPS of +$.66 per share. That’s right—everyone else is bleeding red ink, and eXp is the one still standing in the black.</p>\n<p>Even better, their profitable quarters didn’t just squeak by—they crushed it. The upswings far outweigh the losses, which shows they’re not just surviving; they’re scaling smart.</p>\n<p>In a world where brokerages are slashing splits and hiking agent fees to stay afloat, eXp Realty is clearly built differently—and by different, we mean sustainable.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"732\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4.png\" alt=\"Bar chart showing eXp World Holdings, Inc.’s basic and diluted EPS, both annual and quarterly, from January 2020 to January 2025, highlighting positive earnings in 2021–2022 and slight losses by 2024.\" class=\"wp-image-267008\" style=\"width:823px;height:auto\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4.png 732w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-4-300x176.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"future-outlook-whos-built-to-weather-the-storm\">Future Outlook – Who’s Built to Weather the Storm?</h2>\n<p>So, what did we learn from all those charts and years of earnings data? These brokerages have been through it all—a so-so market, a red-hot frenzy, and the post-boom slump. That’s a rare, beautiful mess of data—and it tells us a lot about which models bend and which ones break.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-new-wave-of-chaos\">A New Wave of Chaos</h3>\n<p>But now, every brokerage—profitable or not—is staring down a new challenge: the NAR settlement. With buyers and sellers more likely to DIY their transactions, and buyer agent commissions under a magnifying glass, we’re probably looking at fewer deals and tighter margins, especially for newer agents.</p>\n<p>This matters a lot depending on how your brokerage earns its keep.</p>\n<p>No cap? No cushion. Brokerages that rely on collecting a cut from every single transaction are about to feel the squeeze. Meanwhile, those with agent commission caps—like eXp Realty’s $16,000 yearly cap—have some insulation. Once an agent hits the cap, eXp doesn’t milk every future deal; just small admin fees. And yet, despite giving agents more, eXp still manages to be the only net profitable brokerage. Go figure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traditional-trouble-ahead\">Traditional Trouble Ahead</h3>\n<p>Traditional brokerages are looking at a much shakier future. Between franchise fees, physical offices, and layers of bloated staffing, their cost structure reads like a 2005 business plan. These expenses don’t do much for agents—but they sure eat up revenue.</p>\n<p>Compare that to cloud-based brokerages: lower costs, higher splits for agents, and more financial runway to actually invest in useful tools. And yes, many still offer optional physical spaces when needed. The math just makes more sense.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"are-we-at-the-blockbuster-moment\">Are We at the Blockbuster Moment?</h3>\n<p>We might be creeping toward a real turning point. As more agents jump to leaner, cloud-based brokerages, traditional models could struggle to cover their overhead. And when that happens, the usual moves kick in: higher agent fees, lower splits, and a mass agent exodus that’s hard to come back from.  Check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyaO7XkjQI&#038;t=31s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anonymous agent reviews</a> and you can see agent complaints are already in high gear.</p>\n<p>It won’t happen overnight (remember Blockbuster?). But eventually, the industry catches on—and once it does, there’s no going back to late fees and laminated folders.</p>\n<p>That said, not every cloud-based model is a guaranteed win either. As we’ve seen, even tech-forward brokerages can crash if their math doesn’t work. If the fees and splits don’t support profitability, they’ll face the same fate: rising costs for agents, less innovation, and fewer tools to help you win clients.</p>\n<p>Bad math is still bad math. More agents just make it louder.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"it-gets-better-what-the-most-successful-real-estate-company-smart-agent-alliance-offer-you\">It Gets Better &#8211; What the Most Successful Real Estate Company + Smart Agent Alliance Offer You</h2>\n<p>The bottom line?

While reviews reach into the past, know that brokerage profitability matters too because that is likely to define your future. So don’t miss our blog all about what are the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/profits\">top real estate companies by profitability</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"insider-feedback-on-12-top-brokerages-from-worst-to-first\">Insider Feedback on 12 Top Brokerages: From Worst to First</h2>\n<p>Time to separate the hype from the helpful. We&#8217;re ranking 12 major real estate brokerage companies based on what actually matters—real estate brokerage reviews from agents who’ve worked there lived it, and left anonymous feedback without sugarcoating a thing.</p>\n<p>These are unfiltered real estate agent reviews, covering the real pros, the ugly cons, and whether they’d actually recommend their brokerage to a friend. If two companies tied in rating, we broke the tie based on that “would-you-recommend” factor.</p>\n<p>Trying to figure out which of the <strong>top real estate brokers in the USA</strong> are legit and which are just running on reputation? You’re about to find out.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compass-fancy-tech-friendly-vibes\">Compass – Fancy Tech &#038; Friendly Vibes</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Compass-Realty-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Compass Realty Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239642 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Compass pulls a 3.7 rating from over 2,000 real estate brokerage reviews, with 60% of agents saying they’d recommend it and 67% approving of the CEO. Solid, but not groundbreaking. That’s a dead-last agent ranking!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents consistently praise the tech, culture, and brand recognition—especially in luxury markets. The tools are sleek, the vibe is collaborative, and the Compass name does some heavy lifting with clients. Leadership and support also get a thumbs up, and agents like the freedom to manage their own schedules (although that exists at pretty much every brokerage).</p>\n<p>But before you get too cozy, here’s the part that doesn’t show up on Glassdoor: Compass is the least profitable brokerage among all publicly traded firms. Yep—again, <em>dead last</em>. We break down the earnings disaster in our <u>blog on brokerage profitability</u>, but spoiler: even the branding can’t cover that kind of red ink.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-compass-cons-when-the-aesthetic-doesnt-pay-the-bills\">The Compass Cons: When the Aesthetic Doesn’t Pay the Bills</h3>\n<p>Now for the part that <em>really</em> matters: the stuff agents complain about when no one from management is listening. Compass may get points for polish, but the real estate agent reviews make it clear—there are cracks behind the clean branding.</p>\n<p>Here’s what’s consistently rubbing agents the wrong way:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Fees and Rough Commission Splits</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Compass isn’t cheap to hang your license. Agents frequently mention hefty monthly fees, confusing commission structures, and extra per-transaction costs that add up fast—especially for those not consistently closing deals. One agent put it bluntly: <em>“Low split, then another 3% per deal? That’s annoying.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>No Leads, No Problem? Actually… It’s a Problem.</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The brokerage may provide sleek tools, but the leads? Not so much. Reviews repeatedly call out the complete lack of company-generated business. Several agents said flat-out: <em>“They don’t provide leads.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>High Pressure, Low Warm Fuzzies</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Many reviews describe Compass as competitive and cutthroat—fine if you thrive on 24/7 hustle, less ideal if you were hoping for work-life balance. One agent described it as, <em>“Just like every other brokerage that swears they’re the best.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Team or Bust</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Compass leans heavily on a team-based structure, which can leave solo agents feeling lost in the shuffle. Multiple reviews say that without a team, it’s hard to gain traction—and support from management feels nonexistent unless you&#8217;re already producing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Corporate Vibes, Minus the Warmth</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Despite the “cool” aesthetic, several agents described the office culture as cold and corporate. There’s a sense that higher-ups stay distant and agents can easily feel like just another headcount. One review summed it up: <em>“Big company, low commission—get lost in the crowd.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So while Compass earns its spot among the top real estate brokerage companies by name recognition and flash, the agent reviews suggest a different story: great surface-level shine, but some serious internal growing pains. If you’re not already a top producer with a team, the costs might just outweigh the perks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"redfin-structure-salary-and-a-side-of-burnout\">Redfin – Structure, Salary, and a Side of Burnout</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Redfin-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Redfin Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239649 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Redfin earns a 3.6 rating with 65% of agents recommending it to a friend and 79% approving of the CEO.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Redfin’s model is different from most of the top real estate brokerage companies. It’s not your typical 1099 commission-only gig. Agents often receive a base salary, benefits, and enjoy a collaborative team culture, making it feel more like a W-2 job with corporate perks.  Agents who like structure and teamwork tend to feel at home at Redfin. Reviews frequently highlight a collaborative culture, supportive coworkers, and management that doesn’t ghost you when things get tough. The ability to work from home, enjoy a flexible(ish) schedule, and earn a base salary with benefits gives it a corporate vibe—but in a way that some agents actually appreciate. And while the tech can be a lot, agents do give Redfin props for keeping things organized and efficient—at least when it’s working.</p>\n<p>It sounds like a dream setup—until you scroll past the star ratings and into the actual complaints.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-redfin-cons-salary-stability-comes-at-a-cost\">The Redfin Cons: Salary Stability Comes at a Cost</h3>\n<p>If Redfin feels more like a corporate job, that’s because… it kind of is. And the <strong>real estate agent reviews</strong> make it clear that stability often comes with strings.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commission Caps &#038; Pay Frustration</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Many agents say the income potential just doesn’t cut it. While the base salary is nice for consistency, the commission structure is limited, and some agents feel they’re leaving money on the table compared to more traditional brokerages.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Weekend Burnout Is Real</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents love the “flexibility”—until they realize it includes working most weekends and juggling a non-stop client load. Reviews call out a lack of real work-life balance due to the heavy volume and rigid expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Clogged Career Paths</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Looking to move up? Not so fast. Many agents feel like they hit a ceiling quickly, with few opportunities to advance or grow inside the company.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Too Many Clients, Too Little Time</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>That structured lead system? It can flood agents with more customers than they can handle, leading to burnout and customer service fatigue. As one review put it: <em>“Great place to start, exhausting to maintain.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Technology Overwhelm</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Yes, Redfin has tech—but some agents say it&#8217;s overkill. The systems are clunky, CRMs could be better, and the constant updates can be more frustrating than helpful.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if you’re someone who likes structure, salary, and teamwork, Redfin could feel like the best real estate brokerage for your needs. But if you&#8217;re after uncapped income, flexible growth, and control over your schedule, you may want to read between the lines—because these real estate reviews show that consistency comes at a cost.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"douglas-elliman-prestige-perks-and-a-few-cracks-in-the-foundation\">Douglas Elliman – Prestige, Perks, and a Few Cracks in the Foundation</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Douglas-Elliman-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Douglas Elliman Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239643 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Douglas Elliman pulls a 3.8 with 67% of agents saying they’d recommend it to a friend, and a solid 88% CEO approval rating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents rave about the brand prestige, strong training and support, and an office culture that leans collaborative. The company’s long-standing presence in luxury markets brings a level of clout that newer brokerages can’t fake. Add in a flexible schedule, a stash of resources, and seasoned leadership (depending on the office), and Douglas Elliman has its perks—especially if you’re newer and want exposure in high-end real estate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-douglas-elliman-cons-fancy-brand-familiar-problems\">The Douglas Elliman Cons: Fancy Brand, Familiar Problems</h3>\n<p>As far as top real estate brokerage companies go, Douglas Elliman gets respect—but not without its share of classic big-brokerage baggage.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commission-Only Pay (and It’s Not Cheap to Stay)</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Like many traditional brokerages, Elliman is 100% commission-based—so you eat what you kill. Agents also say the splits and monthly fees are steep, making it tough to get ahead unless you’re already producing at a high level. <em>“There’s a price to pay for the resources,”</em> one review noted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Competitive &#038; Hierarchical Vibes</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Some offices feel like a team, others feel like high school—complete with cliques and top-producer favoritism. It’s a sink-or-swim environment where newer agents can easily feel sidelined.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Support Isn’t Always Consistent</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Support varies widely by office and manager. While some managers are all-in, others are checked out—and if you don’t speak up or push for help, you may be left to figure it all out on your own.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Outdated Tech and Clunky Tools</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Despite the brokerage’s luxury positioning, the technology doesn’t always match. Several agents called it outdated or non-intuitive, with too many disconnected systems and not enough streamlining.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Communication Gaps from the Top Down</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While some managers are praised, others leave agents feeling ignored. Reviews mention inconsistent support, unclear expectations, and office politics that get in the way of productivity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line? Douglas Elliman may be one of the top real estate brokers in the USA, but agents want the backend to match the brand. If you’re an experienced agent with a strong book of business and a taste for prestige, it could be a solid fit. But if you’re looking for hand-holding or innovation, don’t let the name fool you—it’s not always as polished behind the scenes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-agency-luxury-cool-but-bring-your-own-leads-and-maybe-a-therapist\">The Agency – Luxury Cool, But Bring Your Own Leads (and Maybe a Therapist)</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Agency-Logo.webp\" alt=\"The Agency Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239652 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The Agency scores a strong 4.0 and the agent sentiment is sort of glowing—71% would recommend it to a friend, and 82% approve of the CEO.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The vibe here is sleek and supportive. Agents call out the collegial environment, solid CRM tools, marketing support, and a culture that feels more &#8220;work fam&#8221; than &#8220;corporate cult.&#8221; You get freedom and flexibility to build your business how you want—and if you’re already good at sales, this place can make you look (and feel) like a rockstar.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-agency-cons-great-vibe-but-youd-better-be-scrappy\">The Agency Cons: Great Vibe, but You’d Better Be Scrappy</h3>\n<p>Even with the fancy logo and good vibes, The Agency isn’t immune to the same issues that show up in <em>real estate agent reviews</em> across the board.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Stress and Cutthroat Competition</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Several reviews paint the job as a 24/7 hustle, with one calling it <em>“very stressful”</em>—not because of clients, but because of the pressure to constantly perform in a saturated market.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Management Drama and Favoritism</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Not every manager is a team player. Some agents complain about poor communication, rude leadership, and even shady lead distribution, which feels more like Hunger Games than high-end real estate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Quality Leads? Not Really a Thing Here</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Multiple reviews say leads are sparse—and when they do come, they’re low-budget rentals or dead-end deals. Agents feel like they’re stuck sourcing their own business, which kind of defeats the purpose of having &#8220;support.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Turnover and Team Instability</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Behind the polished brand, there’s high turnover, inconsistent systems, and what sounds like some internal shakeups. Great culture only goes so far if you&#8217;re constantly rebuilding teams or training new managers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, is The Agency one of the best real estate brokerages for high-performing agents who want a luxury brand behind them? Possibly—if you’re self-motivated, already have a pipeline, and don’t mind dodging the occasional internal chaos. But if you’re looking for hand-delivered leads and a team that’s got your back 24/7… the reviews say you might be chasing a dream, not a done deal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"century-21-family-vibes-franchise-fees-and-a-familiar-story\">Century 21 – Family Vibes, Franchise Fees, and a Familiar Story</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Century-21-Realty-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Century 21 Realty Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239640 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Century 21 pulls in a solid 4.1 rating with 74% of agents saying they’d recommend it to a friend and a whopping 89% CEO approval rating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>New agents especially shout out the training, support, and family-style culture. The vibe? Welcoming. The systems? Robust. The brand recognition? Still strong in a lot of markets. If you’re looking for a brokerage that feels like a good first step into real estate—with some hand-holding and a flexible schedule—Century 21 delivers a solid starting point.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-century-21-cons-big-name-big-splits-and-some-outdated-baggage\">The Century 21 Cons: Big Name, Big Splits, and Some Outdated Baggage</h3>\n<p>Century 21 might bring the warm fuzzies, but it also brings the usual old-school brokerage problems. And the real estate agent reviews don’t hold back.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Fees and Splits</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents say the commission splits are steep, especially early on—and some question why they’re still paying franchise fees like it’s 2004. One agent even called it “expensive, but worth it”—which doesn’t exactly scream scalable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Tech That’s Trying Its Best</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The tools and backend systems are there, but agents say they feel clunky or outdated. Too many logins, slow support, and not enough tech-savviness compared to more modern brokerages.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Leads? You’re on Your Own.</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unless you’re on a team or in a high-volume office, don’t expect leads to rain from the sky. Several agents noted the lack of company-generated business—and a need for more long-term support in building client pipelines.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Work-Life Balance? Depends on Your Definition</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Real estate is demanding, sure—but agents here say the workload and weekend grind can make balance feel impossible. If you want your nights and weekends off, you might want to rethink.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So is Century 21 good for you? It depends. If you want structure, mentorship, and a company that still values relationship-building over buzzwords, it might be a good launchpad. But if you’re looking for modern tools, better splits, and lead generation support &#8211; legacy doesn’t always mean leverage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coldwell-banker-big-brand-big-tools-bring-your-own-patience\">Coldwell Banker – Big Brand, Big Tools… Bring Your Own Patience</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Caldwell-Banker-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Coldwell Banker Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239656 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Coldwell Banker scores a shiny 4.1 stars with 78% saying they’d recommend it to a friend and 86% giving the CEO a thumbs-up.

Training gets an A+, especially if you’re new and need someone to tell you what a CRM even is. The company also dishes out solid brand recognition, tons of marketing tools, and a flexible schedule that lets you decide when to hustle (or hide). The culture is consistently called out as supportive and collaborative, with enough experienced agents around to make it feel like you’re not totally winging it.</p>\n<p>The earning potential is there too—assuming you&#8217;re ready to work your tail off. It’s one of the <em>top real estate brokerage companies</em> for those who want big-league branding and have the drive to match.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coldwell-banker-cons-fees-leads-and-the-figure-it-out-method\">Coldwell Banker Cons: Fees, Leads, and the “Figure-It-Out” Method</h3>\n<p>Here’s where Coldwell Banker gets dinged:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fees That Feel a Bit&#8230; Much</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents repeatedly mention high desk fees and commission splits that don’t always feel justified—especially for new agents still figuring out how to unlock the office printer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>New Agents? Good Luck Out There.</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unless you’ve got a mentor lined up or a lead-generating sidekick, support for new agents is hit-or-miss, and leads aren’t exactly being handed out like open house flyers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Real Estate = Real Burnout</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While flexibility is praised, the reality is many agents feel overworked and on call 24/7, with weekends and evenings regularly sacrificed on the altar of client convenience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Starter Required</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You’ll hear it in nearly every <em>real estate brokerage review</em>: success here means being relentlessly self-motivated. If you’re waiting for a manager to swoop in and save you—you’ll be waiting a while.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if you’re looking for prestige, training, and access to a mega-brand name—check. But if you&#8217;re hoping for generous support, a flood of leads, and low startup costs… you might want to read a few more <em>real estate brokerage reviews</em> before you jump in.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"re-max-big-brand-big-splits-big-expectations\">RE/MAX – Big Brand, Big Splits, Big Expectations</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/REMAX-Logo.webp\" alt=\"REMAX Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239650 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>RE/MAX pulls in a solid 4.2 rating with 79% of agents saying they’d recommend it to a friend and 88% approving of the CEO.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents love the freedom to build their own schedule, the strong training, and the big-brand street cred.

Several reviews mention outdated platforms and a slow shift toward digital tools.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>You’re on Your Own in a Competitive Arena</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Corcoran’s vibe is definitely “swim with the sharks.” If you&#8217;re new or introverted, brace yourself—this is not a brokerage where hand-holding is part of the onboarding process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re a self-starter with a client list and a thing for luxury branding, Corcoran can offer you a strong platform and respected name. But if you’re looking for hand-holding, low fees, or built-in lead generation, these <em>real estate brokerage reviews</em> suggest you might want to swipe left and keep looking.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"berkshire-hathaway-big-name-bigger-expectations\">Berkshire Hathaway – Big Name, Bigger Expectations</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Berkshine-Hethaway-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Berkshine Hathaway Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239655 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>With a strong 4.3 rating and 78% of agents say they’d recommend Berkshire Hathaway to a friend, and 98% approve of the CEO.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents love the strong training, recognizable brand, and resources galore—especially for newbies who want structure, and seasoned agents who want to sharpen their edge. It&#8217;s also one of the few <em>top real estate brokerages in the US</em> where you can feel like a pro from day one… assuming you can figure out where all the tools are hiding.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"berkshire-hathaway-cons-big-brand-big-fees-bring-your-own-leads\">Berkshire Hathaway Cons: Big Brand, Big Fees, Bring Your Own Leads</h3>\n<p>As polished as the BHHS brand is, the <em>real estate brokerage reviews</em> pull back the curtain—and it&#8217;s not all gold-plated signs and Warren Buffett quotes.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fees That Keep on Giving (to the Franchise)</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents call out high commission splits and extra fees that eat into profits. The franchise love doesn’t come cheap, and it’s easy to feel like you’re splitting your check five ways before you even cash it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Support? Only if You’re Already Crushing It</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The support starts off strong, but many agents report it fades fast. Once your onboarding hugs are over, you may be left searching for leads (or answers) on your own.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Too Many Tools, Not Enough Streamlining</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>BHHS gets an A+ for having <em>everything</em>. But it’s also a bit of a scavenger hunt. Tools, resources, websites, platforms—they’re scattered like a deck of cards at a toddler’s tea party.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A Little Too Competitive (and Clicky)</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It’s a competitive environment, and a few reviews hint at old-school hierarchies and the dreaded “good ol’ boys club” vibes. The vibe isn’t always inclusive, and agents feel it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, is Berkshire Hathaway one of the top 10 brokerage firms worth joining? If you’re organized, tech-savvy, and ready to make your own leads work harder than your commission split—yes. But if you’re expecting endless hand-holding and free leads, it may feel less like a financial powerhouse and more like a luxury label with an expensive price tag.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sothebys-luxury-brand-high-standards-and-youd-better-show-up-ready\">Sotheby’s – Luxury Brand, High Standards, and You’d Better Show Up Ready</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:16% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sothebys-International-Realty-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Sotheby&#039;s International Realty Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239651 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Sotheby’s clocks in at a strong 4.3 rating where 74% would recommend it, and 89% give the CEO the thumbs up.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents love the global brand recognition, which comes with serious clout for landing luxury clients. Add in a collaborative culture, solid support, flexible scheduling, and plenty of training and growth opportunities, and it’s easy to see why agents speak highly of the experience—especially those already operating in affluent circles.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-sothebys-cons-beautiful-branding-doesnt-pay-the-bills\">The Sotheby’s Cons: Beautiful Branding Doesn’t Pay the Bills</h3>\n<p>Sotheby’s may be one of the top real estate companies by reputation, but the real estate agent reviews remind us that luxury comes at a cost—and not just for the buyers.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Fees and Royalty Cuts</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Here’s the catch: that global brand? It’s not free. Agents mention steep commission splits and royalty fees, with one calling out the 6% branding tax as a bitter pill to swallow. Oh, and tack on hefty E&#038;O fees while you’re at it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Saturated Markets = Fierce Competition</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Want to break into luxury? So does everyone else. Agents report a crowded, competitive field, making it tough for newbies to get traction—especially without robust lead support.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>It’s All You, Baby</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The reviews are clear: if you’re not self-motivated, you’ll drown. There’s minimal hand-holding, and agents say you’re expected to arrive with your own business, or build it fast with little help.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Admin and Tech Headaches</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>For a brand known for elegance, the backend systems can feel clunky and chaotic. Multiple reviews point to too many internal platforms and international coordination gaps that slow things down.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So is Sotheby’s the best real estate brokerage for agents eyeing the luxury lane? If you’ve already got the network, the polish, and the drive, the brand can absolutely elevate your business. But if you’re still figuring it out? Read the real estate brokerage reviews carefully—because while the logo’s fancy, the hustle is still very, very real.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"keller-williams-the-training-champ-with-a-side-of-diy-business-building\">Keller Williams – The Training Champ (With a Side of DIY Business Building)</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Keller-Williams-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Keller Williams Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239646 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Keller Williams pulls in a rock-solid 4.3 stars with 86% recommending it and 94% supporting the CEO.  KW also racks up workplace awards—earning a spot on the <em>Best Places to Work</em> list for eight years running. The brand clearly knows how to make agents feel supported, at least on paper.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>So what’s the real scoop? Agents consistently rave about the top-tier training programs, supportive leadership, and flexible schedule. It’s especially popular among newbies looking for a <em>real estate brokerage that actually teaches you something before throwing you to the wolves</em>. Pair that with a strong mentorship culture and sky’s-the-limit earning potential, and you’ve got one of the <em>top real estate brokerages in the US</em> for getting started.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"where-the-kw-kool-aid-runs-a-bit-thin\">Where the KW Kool-Aid Runs a Bit Thin</h3>\n<p>Even with that glowing reputation, Keller Williams isn’t immune to the usual brokerage gripes. Here’s what the <em>real estate brokerage reviews</em> are throwing shade at:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Steep Fees and Splits</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents say the <em>caps and monthly fees</em> can feel like death by a thousand deductions—especially painful if you&#8217;re not closing deals consistently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>No Lead Fairy</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>There’s no magical lead fountain here. New agents especially note that you’re mostly left to figure out where business comes from… and fast.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Office Politics and Culture Drift</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While many offices feel like a family, others seem more like a high school lunchroom—cliques, cold vibes, and a whole lot of agents crammed into the same boat.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a self-starter who thrives with great training and is ready to hustle for your own leads, Keller Williams might be one of the <em>best real estate brokerage companies</em> to launch your career. The <em>real estate agent reviews</em> are clear—KW’s got the bones… but whether you build a mansion or a money pit is still up to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e-xp-realty-the-cloud-based-powerhouse-agents-actually-recommend\">eXp Realty – The Cloud-Based Powerhouse Agents Actually Recommend</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eXp-Realty-Logo.webp\" alt=\"eXp Realty Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239644 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>With a whopping 4.5-star rating, 92% of agents recommend it, and 96% approve of the CEO.  Plus eXp lands in the Best Places to Work streak that could make Google jealous, with eight straight years on the list and #7 for 2025. eXp Realty isn’t just one of the <em>top real estate brokerage companies</em>—it’s the <em>top-rated one by quite a gap</em> according to the agents living it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you’ve been sifting through <em>real estate agent reviews</em> looking for the <em>best real estate brokerage for new agents</em>, eXp Realty consistently lands near the top. Why? Because it’s got what a modern agent actually needs: flexibility, training, tech tools, community support, and that <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share/\">sweet, sweet revenue share</a>.</p>\n<p>Agents love the massive resource library, cutting-edge tech, and mentorship options. Add in total independence, a positive, collaborative vibe, and the chance to earn stock and passive income. Yeah, <em>exp realty reviews</em> aren’t just good—they’re glowing.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"but-even-the-top-dog-has-its-gaps\">But Even the Top Dog Has Its Gaps</h3>\n<p>No brokerage is perfect, and <em>exp reviews</em> still serve up some constructive truth bombs:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No Brick-and-Mortar? No Buffer</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents who crave a desk and water cooler chat might feel a bit untethered. The lack of a physical office takes some adjustment—though there are free office options if you miss humans.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Starter or Self-Sabotager</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>eXp Realty is not here to babysit. If you need constant hand-holding and someone checking your homework, this probably isn’t your scene. It’s a freedom-first model—with more training than you’ll know what to do with—but it’s on <em>you</em> to show up and use it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Mentorship Roulette</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While many mentors are fantastic, the quality has been inconsistent in the past. The good news? The mentorship program is improving and you can change mentors if need be.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Tech Can Get Noisy</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Yes, there’s tons of tech. No, not all of it is perfect. KVCore gets the most heat, with some agents wishing for an upgrade or more intuitive tools.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>eXp Realty isn’t just the top real estate brokerage in the world according to many agents—it’s one of the few that actually <em>acts</em> like it. For the driven, tech-friendly, and independent agent who wants scalability, collaboration, and a legit path to passive income, eXp checks nearly every box. Just make sure you’re ready to run your business like a business—because while eXp offers tons of training, nobody’s strapping on your helmet and pushing the bike. You’ve got to pedal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-is-the-shortcut-to-the-brokerage-support-you-actually-want\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Is the Shortcut to the Brokerage Support You Actually Want</h2>\n<p>After reading real estate brokerage reviews from agents who’ve lived through the chaos, one thing becomes crystal clear: most brokerages overpromise and underdeliver.
