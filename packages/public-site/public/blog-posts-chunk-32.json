Or more accurately, the lack of it.

On average, <a href=\"https://solutions.exprealty.com/uncategorized/clearwater-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp agents bank more than $8,000</a> each year from switching to eXp Realty Healthcare – that’s a whopping 60% or more reduction in fixed medical expenses. But the savings don’t stop there. Clearwater reports an eye-popping <a href=\"https://www.clearwaterhealth.com/for-individuals-and-families\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80% drop in out-of-pocket costs</a> for eXp agents compared to traditional health insurance plans. Imagine keeping more of your hard-earned cash while still enjoying top-notch medical care.</p>\n<h3 id=\"same-quality-care-with-nationwide-open-networks\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Same Quality Care with Nationwide Open Networks</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Switch to eXp Realty Healthcare, and you won&#8217;t sacrifice quality for cost. Thanks to access to two of the nation&#8217;s largest PPO networks, finding the perfect doctor or specialist is a breeze. Love your current doctor? No worries, you’re likely to keep them thanks to the extensive network options.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-limits-maximum-payouts-or-hassles\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">No Limits, Maximum Payouts, or Hassles</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Say goodbye to the usual limits on doctor visits, labs, and prescriptions. With eXp, the coverage keeps on giving, without caps to hold you back. If you hate dealing with logistics, you’ll love the Care Coordination team. They help you find providers and schedule the care you need for labs, imaging, and hospital services. Plus, when you use this service, your copays and out-of-pocket costs are waived. You heard that right! Your care will be free!</p>\n<h3 id=\"expert-second-opinion-services\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Expert Second Opinion services</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s right! At eXp Realty Healthcare, you’ll get the added perk of having access to life-saving consultations from leading specialists in their field for that all-important second opinion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-enrollment-deadlines\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">No Enrollment Deadlines</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Forget about enrollment deadlines. eXp Realty Healthcare lets you jump on board any time of the year. eXp agents are not inconvenienced by those traditional medical enrollment deadlines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-healthcare\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mental Healthcare</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And there’s more. eXp Realty, through Clearwater, also provides <a href=\"https://expworldholdings.com/press-releases/exp-realty-introduces-telemedicine-plan-for-exp-agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Telemedicine</a> to bring agents high-quality virtual mental health services. eXp Realty is always looking out for the best for their agents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exp-realty-healthcare-vs-other-brokerages\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">eXp Realty Healthcare vs Other Brokerages</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/fc06ad86b674a082-ePHYMn2K7w1y9ZbSpTMho.png/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1144\" height=\"589\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This chart says it all. When comparing eXp Realty with other big brokerages such as Coldwell Banker, Remas, KW, Berkshire Hathoway, Compass, and even Real, eXp shines. Of all these brokerages, only eXp offers exclusive health plans for their agents. Additionally, only eXp Realty has innovative healthcare plans that save agents thousands of dollars every year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"success-stories\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Success Stories</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ready for some personal actual agent stories? When eXp Realty Healthcare became an option, many eXp agents decided to give it a go. The following examples reflect individual agent experiences and are not representative of all outcomes. Here are some of their stories.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cancer-diagnosis-dollar8000-saved-annually\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cancer Diagnosis &#8211; $8000 Saved Annually</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At 26<a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-agent-healthcare-silverman-sinnona/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">, Florida realtor Beth Silverman</a> fought breast cancer alongside struggles to secure and afford health insurance as an independent contractor. Beth said, “Being a real estate agent meant endless battles for insurance that normal people who have not been touched by cancer can never understand.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now in remission, Beth faced recurring challenges such as annual re-enrollment, soaring premiums, and restricted networks. By switching to eXp Realty Healthcare, Beth saves roughly $8,000 annually on premiums. She says, “I have a cost-sharing plan through eXp, and it’s different than what people are used to. It’s community-based, and trust me … I’m saving thousands in the yearly premium, and prescription costs are a bit cheaper.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"same-doctors-same-care-quality-dollar10000-saved-annually\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Same Doctors, Same Care Quality &#8211; $10,000 Saved Annually</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-agent-healthcare-silverman-sinnona/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joe Sinnona from Long Beach</a>, New York, an eXp agent, discovered substantial savings with eXp Realty Healthcare Clearwater compared to his previous health plan. In 2018, Joe was paying $1,500 a month for his family’s health insurance, and the cost was set to increase to $1,850.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Facing these rising costs, Joe and his wife considered dropping their coverage but ultimately found a more affordable solution through eXp. Now, they pay just $791 monthly for the family’s healthcare and have even added dental coverage for an additional $100 a month.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joe shares, “Same doctors, same quality of care. I raised the deductible and was able to get this affordable healthcare plan through eXp Realty.” He aims to serve as a testament to other agents seeking reliable and cost-effective health insurance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"same-doctors-dollar12000-saved-annually\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Same Doctors &#8211; $12,000 Saved Annually</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Drew Schroeder from Indianapolis, an eXp Realty ICON Agent, found himself reevaluating his health insurance as <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-agent-healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">costs soared to $1,588 per month</a>. After consulting his financial advisors and discussing the eXp Realty Healthcare Clearwater plan via a thorough Zoom meeting, Drew was convinced by the plan’s value.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Drew’s words, “This is a special program your company is offering you. You need to do it.” By switching, Drew saves over $12,000 annually while maintaining the same doctors for his family. He appreciates how eXp helps bridge common gaps for agents, allowing him to focus on family and his career without the stress of healthcare costs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"innovative-solutions-for-the-best-solution\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Innovative Solutions for the Best Solution</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Gogo Bethke’s husband left his corporate job, the family lost their employer-provided health insurance. Gogo was shocked at the high cost of open-market healthcare. <a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-agent-healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Previously paying around $900 monthly</a>, including coverage for their son who has Type 1 diabetes, they needed an affordable alternative.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clearwater offered a personalized solution, splitting their son’s coverage into an open market plan and the rest of the family’s into a Clearwater plan. Now, Gogo pays about $400 for her son’s plan and $865 for the family, which is significantly less than potential open-market costs.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gogo said “It’s still much cheaper than the open market where we would be paying three times the cost”. Plus, Gogo says that the Clearwater plan her family chose offers very inexpensive prescriptions, diagnostic services, and doctor visits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-plans-do-exp-agents-typically-choose\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Plans Do eXp Agents Typically Choose?</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/82a603abcaa4d10a-What-Plans-Do-eXp-Agents-Typically-Choose.png/public\" alt=\"a man in a suit and hat.

Based on internal Clearwater guidance patterns reported to agents:</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">85% of eXp agents find that Clearwater is a great fit. This includes people who are generally healthy and under 65 years old.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">10% of eXp agents get traditional health insurance through advice from Clearwater at no additional cost than the open market provides. This is a good fit for people with pre-existing conditions.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">5% of eXp agents are advised by Clearwater to stay on their current plan. But, even if you don’t make a switch, it’s great to have the Clearwater professionals let you know that you are already on the right plan.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So, the vast majority of eXp agents end up with a Clearwater plan. But, all of them get expert advice to determine what is best for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-it-easy-to-sign-up-for-exp-realty-healthcare\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is it easy to sign up for eXp Realty Healthcare?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Absolutely! Choosing the right plan is simple with the guidance of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://expagenthealthcare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">eXp Realty Healthcare team</a>. Clearwater states that it takes less than five minutes to enroll. Getting healthcare is fast and simple for eXp agents.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-also-ask-about-e-xp-healthcare\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About eXp Healthcare</h2>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-healthcare-required-if-i-join-e-xp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is eXp Healthcare required if I join eXp Realty?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. eXp Healthcare is optional and does not replace the brokerage relationship. Agents may choose to use eXp Healthcare, select traditional open-market insurance, or remain on an existing plan. Participation has no impact on commission splits, caps, sponsorship placement, or standing with eXp Realty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-e-xp-healthcare-compare-to-health-benefits-at-traditional-brokerages\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does eXp Healthcare compare to health benefits at traditional brokerages?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most real estate brokerages do not offer healthcare options for independent contractors. eXp Healthcare differs by providing access to curated healthcare solutions and expert guidance, allowing agents to evaluate lower-cost and alternative structures rather than navigating open-market plans alone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-is-e-xp-healthcare-best-suited-for\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is eXp Healthcare best suited for?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Healthcare is commonly used by independent agents under 65 who want lower fixed healthcare costs and predictable out-of-pocket exposure. It may not be ideal for every situation, which is why agents are evaluated individually rather than placed into a single plan.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-remarks\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Healthcare is designed to address one of the most common blind spots for independent agents, affordable and functional healthcare, but it does not operate in isolation or replace the broader brokerage experience.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1715795567491\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Do all eXp Realty agents receive access to eXp Healthcare?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. U.S.-based eXp Realty agents are eligible to explore eXp Healthcare through Clearwater Benefits. Access is available to all qualifying agents regardless of production level, team affiliation, or sponsor, and agents are free to decide whether participation makes sense for them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1715795574890\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is enrollment in eXp Healthcare mandatory or automatic?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Enrollment is never mandatory and does not occur automatically. Agents must actively choose to engage with eXp Healthcare and review options with Clearwater Benefits. Agents may opt out entirely without any effect on their brokerage relationship.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1715795587684\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Are there enrollment periods or deadlines for eXp Healthcare?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Unlike traditional health insurance, eXp Healthcare does not require agents to enroll during annual open enrollment periods. Agents may explore options and enroll at any time during the year based on personal or financial changes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1715795600699\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Does eXp Healthcare replace traditional health insurance?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>It can, but not always. Depending on an agent’s needs, Clearwater may recommend alternative cost-sharing solutions, traditional marketplace insurance, supplemental coverage, or remaining on an existing plan. eXp Healthcare functions as guided access, not a replacement mandate.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"related-e-xp-realty-solutions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related eXp Realty Solutions</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/offices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty Offices Exist: Here’s How They Work!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/success-lending/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Success Lending eXp: eXp Realty Agents Provide Mortgage Solutions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/curbio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curbio + eXp Realty: The Hassle-Free Way to Boost Listings</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Screen sharing and virtual whiteboards make every meet-up more engaging, allowing you to share documents or hash out ideas on the fly.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also explore neighborhoods with clients using 360 photos and Google Street View right within the platform.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp World is built to handle any meeting type with ease.

It provides optional structure that may include guidance, systems, and long-term leverage depending on sponsor involvement. Sponsor value compounds over time when aligned with an agent’s goals. Misalignment rarely causes failure, but it often creates friction that slows growth.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tl-dr-about-e-xp-realty-sponsorship\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>TL;DR About eXp Realty Sponsorship</strong></h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sponsorship at eXp is optional but consequential</li>\n<li>eXp provides the brokerage platform regardless of sponsor</li>\n<li>Sponsor involvement varies widely</li>\n<li>Sponsor choice affects daily experience</li>\n<li>Sponsor choice affects optional income and leverage</li>\n<li>Fit depends on career stage and goals</li>\n<li>Changing primary sponsors later is limited or impossible</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sponsorship at eXp is optional, but it is not neutral. It affects how agents experience support, infrastructure, and long-term leverage beyond the brokerage platform itself.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sponsor choice is often underestimated because the consequences tend to appear later. Misalignment usually creates friction rather than immediate failure.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This pillar introduces the major sponsorship topics agents evaluate when deciding how, and whether, sponsor alignment fits their business.

Sponsorship exists alongside that platform as an optional, structural relationship between agents.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A sponsor is the agent named at onboarding and becomes part of an agent’s permanent upline. Sponsors may choose to provide guidance, systems, training, or community, but eXp does not require sponsors to offer any support. Many sponsors provide minimal involvement beyond the formal relationship.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mentorship and team leadership are separate from sponsorship. Mentors support onboarding for new agents. Production team leaders manage sales activity and commissions. Sponsors do not control transactions, splits, or business operations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-what-is-an-e-xp-sponsor\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How the eXp Realty Sponsor Program Is Structured</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before evaluating sponsor fit, it helps to understand how the sponsor program actually works. This includes the role of a primary sponsor, how the upline structure functions, and how sponsorship differs from mentorship or team leadership. This guide focuses on structure and rules, not sponsor quality.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For all the details, explore <a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/program-basics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>How the eXp Realty Sponsor Program Is Structured</em></a> in our full deep-dive guide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-primary-sponsor-vs-co-sponsor\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is an eXp Sponsor and Co-Sponsor?</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sponsors and co-sponsors serve different roles inside eXp’s sponsorship framework.

It is designed for agents who specialize in high-value residential properties and require marketing, branding, and exposure beyond standard brokerage offerings.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The division combines luxury-specific tools with eXp Realty’s cloud-based platform, allowing agents to operate globally while maintaining independence at the local level.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Launched in October 2022, <a href=\"https://expworldholdings.com/press-releases/the-future-of-luxury-real-estate-has-arrived-at-exp-realty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Luxury</a> expanded into multiple domestic and international markets and established a dedicated membership structure within eXp Realty. The division expanded into Canada and Puerto Rico and continues to roll out internationally across key luxury markets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-evolution-of-e-xp-realty-luxury-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Elite Marketing eXp Realty Luxury Clients Love!</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ae4559e09bf2680d-eXp-Realty-Luxury-Evolution.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty Luxury Evolution\" class=\"wp-image-8331\" width=\"1000\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eXp-Realty-Luxury-Evolution.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eXp-Realty-Luxury-Evolution-980x220.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eXp-Realty-Luxury-Evolution-480x108.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luxury clients expect more than standard MLS exposure or generic listing packages. They want elevated presentation, targeted reach, and credibility that resonates with affluent buyers across markets. eXp Luxury was built to deliver that level of marketing without forcing agents into a separate brokerage or franchise model.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This marketing is commonly used by agents competing for high-value listings where presentation, reach, and credibility are central to the listing decision.</p>\n<h3 id=\"luxury-listing-distribution-show-actual-mock-up-1-page-at-a-time\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Luxury Listing Distribution</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Luxury listings receive exposure across a curated network of high-end media outlets and digital platforms frequented by affluent buyers. Listings are syndicated to luxury-focused publications and environments such as <em>The Wall Street Journal, Mansion Global, Robb Report, Barron’s, MarketWatch, Unique Homes</em>, and other premium destinations.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents can present sellers with electronic mockups showing how their property will appear in these outlets, creating immediate credibility during listing appointments and reinforcing confidence in the marketing strategy.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This level of placement helps listings stand out, attracts qualified interest, and supports stronger pricing conversations from the start.</p>\n<h3 id=\"global-reach-with-exp-realty-luxury-international-reach-picture\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Global Marketing and Listing Exposure</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Luxury extends listing visibility well beyond a single local market. Properties are distributed across more than 80 international real estate platforms, with listings translated and targeted toward global luxury buyers in markets such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, and South America.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This global reach is reinforced by eXp Realty’s international agent network, allowing listings to be shared directly with agents and buyers across multiple countries. For luxury sellers, this expands the buyer pool. For agents, it provides a clear differentiator when competing for high-end listings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"perfect-luxury-listing-presentation-for-clients-presentation-photo-part\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Elevated <strong>Listing Presentation and Digital Experience</strong></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"389\" height=\"457\" class=\"wp-image-8323 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ccd90f508548ac41-eXp-Realty-Luxury-presentation-for-clients.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty Luxury presentation for clients\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Presentation matters at the luxury level. eXp Luxury provides agents with tools to deliver polished, high-end digital experiences that reflect the value of the property and the professionalism of the agent.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luxury listings are supported with dedicated property websites, high-resolution imagery, video assets, and aerial visuals designed to perform across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Social and digital distribution is built into the presentation strategy, ensuring listings are optimized for modern buyer behavior without sacrificing refinement.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The result is a cohesive, magazine-quality presentation that feels appropriate for luxury clients and competitive in premium markets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testimonials-show-testimonial-2-and-3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Testimonials&nbsp;</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last, listen to what actual clients have said about their experience with eXp Luxury.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">John Siy, a Miami investor, says, “Access to a network of resources, a vast portfolio of high-end properties and the best in customer service is what sets eXp Luxury apart from the rest of the pack”.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kayle Moore, a Dallas customer, says, “There are plenty of opportunities in real estate, and I’ve found that most real estate agents want to do things the same old way.&nbsp; eXp Luxury is different.&nbsp; They’re technologically advanced, highly experienced, knowledgeable, and professional.&nbsp; They helped set my property apart”.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As an eXp Luxury agent, you’ll showcase these eXp Realty Luxury testimonials, and many others, until you create your own excellent testimonials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-exp-realty-luxury-experience-what-agents-love\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The eXp Realty Luxury Experience – What Agents Love!</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond client-facing marketing, eXp Luxury is designed to support agents operationally, creatively, and strategically. The division provides centralized tools, branding resources, and collaboration opportunities that help agents run a more polished luxury business without assembling everything on their own.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-dashboard-full-of-value-dashboard-video\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Luxury Agent Dashboard and Campaign Tools</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Luxury agents gain access to a dedicated dashboard that centralizes luxury-specific resources. From this dashboard, agents can initiate listing campaigns, manage marketing assets, and deploy presentation tools efficiently.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One standout feature is the ability to generate customized, branded listing presentations quickly. By inserting property details and imagery, agents can produce professional, multi-page presentations suitable for luxury listing appointments without relying on outside design services.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These tools save time while maintaining a consistent, elevated standard across marketing materials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"luxury-branding-and-design-center\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Luxury Branding and Design Center</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Luxury Design Center provides agents with access to eXp Luxury–specific branding assets, including logo options and professionally designed templates. These materials are distinct from standard eXp branding and are reserved for agents approved within the Luxury division.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Agents can customize marketing materials such as brochures, postcards, signage, email assets, and listing presentations while maintaining a cohesive luxury aesthetic. Importantly, agents retain the ability to use their personal branding alongside eXp Luxury branding, consistent with eXp Realty’s broader branding flexibility.</p>\n<h3 id=\"preferred-vendors-support-and-coaching-resources\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Preferred Vendors, Support, and Coaching Resources</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Luxury agents also benefit from a curated vendor marketplace featuring providers commonly used in the luxury space, such as photography, videography, staging, websites, CRM platforms, and client gifting services. Many of these vendors offer preferred pricing due to eXp Realty’s scale.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additional support resources include a dedicated support center, onboarding and tutorial content, and access to coaching and educational opportunities tailored to luxury agents. These resources are designed to help agents refine their positioning, marketing execution, and client experience over time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exclusive-private-masterminds-to-elevate-your-luxury-real-estate-game\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Private Masterminds and Ongoing Luxury Education</h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/82da90dd609525d0-eXp-Realty-Luxury-Agent-Exclusive-Private-Mastermind-Calls.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty Luxury Agent Exclusive Private Mastermind Calls\" class=\"wp-image-8332\" width=\"1000\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eXp-Realty-Luxury-Agent-Exclusive-Private-Mastermind-Calls.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eXp-Realty-Luxury-Agent-Exclusive-Private-Mastermind-Calls-980x308.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/eXp-Realty-Luxury-Agent-Exclusive-Private-Mastermind-Calls-480x151.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Luxury hosts private, members-only masterminds and training sessions focused specifically on luxury real estate.

This structure supports continuous learning without requiring travel or rigid schedules.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, eXp Luxury agents receive the <em>eXp Luxury Spotlight</em>, a monthly email that shares updates, program enhancements, upcoming events, and relevant resources.

However, to unlock these benefits, certain criteria must be met.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Team members must belong to an officially registered eXp Realty Standard, Domestic, or Mega Icon Team. Crucially, the team leader must already be enrolled in eXp Luxury for team members to qualify for the discounted membership rate.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This framework ensures that the integrity and standards of the eXp Luxury program are upheld, providing a structured path for teams aiming to excel in the luxury market.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exp-realty-luxury-requirement-for-canadian-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">eXp Realty Luxury Requirement for Canadian Agents</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty warmly welcomes Canadian agents into the fold of eXp Luxury, acknowledging the vibrant and diverse real estate market in Canada.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It&#8217;s essential to recognize that the eXp Luxury division for Canadian agents comes with its own set of pricing, qualifications, and application processes, tailored to meet the unique demands of the Canadian luxury real estate landscape. Agents interested in elevating their career with eXp Luxury in Canada are encouraged to initiate their journey by visiting <a href=\"https://join.expluxury.com/canada/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">join eXp Luxury in Canada</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-investment-in-excellence-exp-realty-luxury-membership-cost\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Investment in Excellence: eXp Realty Luxury Membership Cost</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Embarking on a journey with eXp Realty Luxury is an investment in elevating your real estate career to the highest echelons of the luxury market. For an annual fee of $2,500 USD for a primary member and $995 for team members, you unlock access to an unparalleled suite of marketing tools and resources.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This membership fee includes showcasing up to 10 luxury listings simultaneously across eXp Luxury’s elite digital publications and in more than 80 international markets.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It&#8217;s important to note that this limit refers to concurrent listings &#8211; you are not restricted to showcasing only 10 listings per year. Instead, as soon as one property is sold or removed, you can introduce another. This ongoing cycle of renewal allows you to showcase an ever-evolving collection of exquisite properties to a global audience all year round.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The value derived from joining eXp Luxury far surpasses the investment, translating into tens of thousands of dollars in marketing power, global exposure, and partner discounts.&nbsp; Thus, with eXp Realty Luxury, the cost of membership is a stepping-stone to achieving unprecedented success in the luxury real estate market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-also-ask-about-e-xp-luxury\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About eXp Luxury</h2>\n<h3 id=\"who-is-e-xp-luxury-best-suited-for\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is eXp Luxury best suited for?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Luxury is best suited for agents who regularly work with high-end residential clients and want access to elevated branding, global exposure, and luxury-focused marketing tools. It appeals to agents who already operate in the upper tiers of the market and want centralized resources that support premium positioning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-e-xp-luxury-differ-from-standard-residential-real-estate-at-e-xp\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does eXp Luxury differ from standard residential real estate at eXp?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Standard residential real estate at eXp emphasizes local marketing and general consumer exposure. eXp Luxury adds international visibility, premium media placement, and luxury-specific presentation standards designed to showcase high-end properties and agent branding beyond a single local market.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-luxury-required-to-sell-high-priced-homes\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is eXp Luxury required to sell high-priced homes?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. Agents may sell high-priced or luxury homes without joining eXp Luxury. Division membership is optional and intended for agents who want specialized branding, marketing tools, and broader exposure tailored specifically to the luxury segment, rather than changing how transactions are handled.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-this-matters-before-you-join-e-xp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Programs like eXp Luxury are designed to support high-end residential marketing and global exposure, but they do not operate in isolation or replace the broader eXp Realty experience.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713673052392\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Does joining eXp Luxury change commission splits or caps?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Joining eXp Luxury does not change an agent’s standard eXp Realty commission split or annual cap. The brokerage compensation structure remains the same. Any eXp Luxury membership fees or requirements are separate from commissions and do not affect how transactions are counted toward capping.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713673058418\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is eXp Luxury available internationally?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. eXp Luxury is available in multiple countries, but availability, eligibility requirements, and pricing can vary by market. International participation depends on local regulations, branding standards, and market infrastructure. Agents should confirm current availability and requirements in their specific country or region.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713673068365\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Can agents keep their own branding while using eXp Luxury?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. Agents may continue using their personal branding while also leveraging eXp Luxury marketing assets and exposure. The division is designed to enhance, not replace, an agent’s existing brand, allowing flexibility in how luxury tools and recognition are incorporated into marketing efforts. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1768242428769\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is eXp Luxury optional for eXp Realty agents?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. eXp Luxury is an optional division layered on top of the core eXp Realty residential brokerage. Agents can successfully transact luxury properties without joining. The division exists for agents who want additional branding, exposure, and tools tailored specifically to the luxury segment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1768242457269\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">How do I become an eXp Realty Luxury agent?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>You must first join eXp Realty to become eligible for the eXp Luxury program.

This shift changes how legal liability, compliance, and operational oversight are handled while allowing broker-owners to continue leading their teams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mitigate-risk-no-more-liability\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mitigate Risk &#8211; No More Liability</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the primary reasons brokerages explore eXp Realty is to reduce brokerage-level legal exposure and the operational burden associated with managing compliance and risk internally.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Broker-owners reduce brokerage-level legal exposure by operating under eXp Realty’s centralized compliance and brokerage oversight structure. Responsibilities such as contract oversight, transaction review, and brokerage-level compliance are handled through eXp Realty’s centralized operational and legal infrastructure.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This shift allows broker-owners to redirect time away from administrative oversight toward leadership, agent development, and business growth priorities.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/487523f1566ac40f-Joining-eXp-Realty-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp.webp/public\" alt=\"Joining eXp Realty why brokerages are moving to exp\" class=\"wp-image-8382\" width=\"1000\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Joining-eXp-Realty-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Joining-eXp-Realty-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-980x232.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Joining-eXp-Realty-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-480x114.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<h2 id=\"save-money-eliminate-andor-reduce-expenses\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Save Money &#8211; Eliminate &amp;/or Reduce Expenses</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Diving into eXp Realty transforms the financial landscape for brokerages dramatically. Here’s athe scoop on the next big reason why brokerages are moving to exp:</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Physical office leases</strong> and related overhead are not required under eXp Realty’s cloud-based brokerage model. eXp’s cloud-based setup means you can ditch the bricks and mortar without ditching professionalism or productivity.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Hello, Regus!</strong> Need a professional setting for a client meeting or a quiet workspace? You and your agents gain complimentary access to Regus Office business lounges, boasting over 4000 locations worldwide. Agents and brokers have access to Regus business lounges under eXp Realty’s enterprise agreement.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>Brokerage-level staffing, technology, and training costs are centralized through eXp Realty’s platform. </strong>Tired of the financial juggle with staffing, technology, and training? eXp handles it all with their virtual platform and staff of over 2000 employees.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Broker-owners often review their existing expense structure to determine which operational costs shift to eXp Realty under its brokerage model.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/326386dda992af3d-cheaper-costs-is-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp.webp/public\" alt=\"cheaper costs is why brokerages are moving to exp\" class=\"wp-image-8383\" width=\"1000\" height=\"260\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cheaper-costs-is-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cheaper-costs-is-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-980x255.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cheaper-costs-is-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-480x125.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<h2 id=\"save-time-and-money-by-operating-more-efficiently\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Save Time (&amp; Money) by Operating More Efficiently</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And here’s the third solid reason why brokerages are moving to eXp. eXp Realty provides centralized operational support through its brokerage staff and managing broker network.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s because of those 2000+ brokers and staff that eXp provides who are ready to leap into action for all your agent support needs including payment processing, accounting, tech support, marketing, state broker rooms, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Broker-owners are no longer responsible for direct contract review, brokerage-level compliance questions, or in-house training administration.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Broker-owners transition away from wearing multiple operational roles simultaneously. Now you can focus on what matters, whether it’s doing more deals, growing your business, or basking in more time for leisure.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other eXp Realty benefits:</p>\n<h3 id=\"training-extravaganza\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Training</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty offers more than 50 hours of live training each week, along with on-demand recorded sessions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lead-generation-galore\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lead Generation </h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp provides tons of lead gen tools and exclusive partnerships, through optional lead generation tools and third-party partnerships.</p>\n<h3 id=\"transaction-wizardry\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transaction</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wave goodbye to paper chaos with a sleek, paperless transaction system.

Growing your business globally is the 4th reason why brokerages are moving to eXp.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditionally, growing a brokerage is tough going. Brokers are stuck with a finite, restricted market share. Expanding beyond your locale was a Herculean task.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But eXp flips that script. At eXp, you can attract agents in all 50 states and in over 24 markets around the world. We&#8217;re talking about spreading your business to agents in Canada, Puerto Rico, South Africa, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, India, Mexico, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, and many more. Plus, you can be the force that opens up another country on eXp’s behalf!</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty’s international footprint allows broker-owners to expand agent recruitment beyond local or regional markets without forming separate brokerage entities.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, your global reach increases your opportunity to work with friends and family in different states and countries. That increases your work satisfaction!</p>\n<h2 id=\"grow-exponentially\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Grow Exponentially</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ready to turbocharge your brokerage growth? eXp Realty&#8217;s agent attraction aka “revenue share” model will get your agents to increase your team like never before! This is the fifth reason why brokerages are moving to eXp. eXp Realty offers a revenue share program that distributes a portion of company dollar to qualifying agents based on sponsorship and production activity.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty grows exponentially because it hands all agents the most irresistible value proposition: recruit by sponsoring other agents to join eXp and earn a slice of the company’s revenue, as detailed in their <a href=\"https://www.exprealty.com/income\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official revenue share program</a>. Revenue share runs seven-tiers deep creating a potentially exponentially growing revenue income.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp World Holdings publicly reports revenue share distributions as part of its financial disclosures, with payouts triggered by qualifying transactions under published program rules. This income operates as an additional compensation stream under defined program rules.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Additionally, you and your agents will find that recruiting at eXp is much easier given the huge value package. This includes stock awards, health insurance options, luxury and commercial divisions, eXp world metaverse, our private workplace group for questions and referrals, skyslope for easy transaction paperwork, BoldTrail &#8211; a top robust industry CRM, ExpressOffers &amp; OpenDoor for all cash purchases, Utility Connect for a free client white glove moving experience, and so much more.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp continues to add more features for agents and their clients.

Under program rules, qualifying revenue share may continue after an agent steps away from active production, subject to eligibility requirements.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s because eXp’s revenue share model stretches far beyond the additional revenue share income stream. It&#8217;s a golden key to lasting financial independence, as you can keep it even after you retire! Earning when you retire is another reason why brokerages are moving to exp.</p>\n<h2 id=\"provide-for-loved-ones-after-youre-gone\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Provide for Loved Ones After You’re Gone</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Your revenue share income is willable to your loved ones so they can keep earning income even when you aren’t here to provide it. Revenue share may be transferred to an estate under eXp Realty’s program terms, subject to eligibility and administrative requirements.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keep-your-brand-if-you-want\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep Your Brand If You Want</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Got a brand that&#8217;s all you? Perfect! At eXp Realty, wave goodbye to the idea of shelving your unique brand identity. You&#8217;ve poured heart, soul, and a tidy sum into crafting your brand&#8217;s look and feel, and there&#8217;s no need to give that up when you join forces with eXp.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, if you’d prefer to use eXp Realty’s branding, eXp Realty provides clear branding guidelines to help. Using these guidelines ensures that every piece of content reflects the professionalism of eXp Realty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cultivate-happier-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Agent Retention and Resource Access</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9141fe2a03ca3fc4-a-happy-agent-showing-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp.webp/public\" alt=\"a happy agent showing why brokerages are moving to exp\" class=\"wp-image-8387\" width=\"1000\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a-happy-agent-showing-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a-happy-agent-showing-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-980x286.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a-happy-agent-showing-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-480x140.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Retention and resources is another reason independent brokerages are moving to exp. Each agent at eXp Realty pays a relatively small $85 a month for a standardized set of brokerage tools and services. Let&#8217;s break some of those down:</p>\n<h3 id=\"crm-and-technology\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">CRM and Technology:</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Imagine a world where automated marketing campaigns, slick IDX websites, and lead-generation tools are the norm. Well, at eXp, that&#8217;s just Tuesday. Your agents will have everything they need to keep their pipeline full and flowing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"agent-network\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Agent Network:</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Picture a vibrant community where you and your agents can mingle with over 89,000 peers. Thanks to Workplace and ethe eXp World metaverse, collaboration just hit a new level of cool.</p>\n<h3 id=\"marketing\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Marketing:</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Need a flyer? A listing template? Business cards that pop? eXp’s customizable templates mean your brand’s always on point and in the spotlight without breaking a sweat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wealth-building\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wealth Building:</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty incorporates multiple optional income and ownership programs alongside commission-based production. Your agents can tap into not one, not two, but three streams of income. From high industry splits for deals to stock awards to income through revenue share. We’re talking serious wealth-building mojo.</p>\n<h3 id=\"100-payouts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">100% Payouts:</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With eXp, your agents get a sweet 80/20 commission split with a low $16,000 annual cap. That cap is even lower for organized teams &#8211; more on that below. Earning 100% after capping will leave both you and your agents satisfied. Plus, when agents meet ICON status qualifications, they earn their full cap back in company stock.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And eXp Realty offers even more than that list of benefits. Plus, what eXp brings to the table increases constantly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choose-how-to-operate-exp-realty-team-organization\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choose How to Operate &#8211; eXp Realty Team Organization</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty offers brokers the autonomy to shape their team operations to fit their vision within the framework of a few key guidelines and essential criteria.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A team at eXp includes a spearheading agent or team leader with one or more licensed agents working together under a collective team banner.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cornerstone of this structure is the team agreement: a pact, carefully crafted and agreed upon by both the team leader and members. This written accord lays down the groundwork, ensuring every facet aligns with federal, state, and local regulations and eXp Realty&#8217;s policies.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Let&#8217;s unfold the nuances of the various team structures at eXp Realty, highlighting what sets each apart:</p>\n<h3 id=\"self-organized-team\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Self-Organized Team</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Team roster is required and provided to eXp. Caps are not reduced, but there’s no minimum referral percentage required to the team leader. Additionally, there’s no requirement for a formal Team Agreement besides a written referral on file with eXp.</p>\n<h3 id=\"standard-team\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Standard Team</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Team roster is required and provided to eXp. Caps are reduced to half ($8000) for team members. There’s a 25% minimum referral percentage required for team leaders for any Team member choosing the reduced cap option. A Team agreement is required in writing with eXp approval. Requires a minimum of $6 million or 30 closed transactions in the previous 12 months.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mega-icon-team-leaders\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mega Icon team leaders</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It is the same as Standard Teams, except caps are reduced to a quarter ($4000) for team members, and it requires a minimum of $40 million and 175 closed transactions, with a minimum of 10 capping team members in the previous 12 months.</p>\n<h2 id=\"take-advantage-of-boost\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take Advantage of Boost</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/b3a8e6e3b6281240-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-one-reason-is-for-the-Boost-program.webp/public\" alt=\"why brokerages are moving to exp, one reason is for the Boost program\" class=\"wp-image-8388\" width=\"1000\" height=\"279\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-one-reason-is-for-the-Boost-program.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-one-reason-is-for-the-Boost-program-980x273.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/why-brokerages-are-moving-to-exp-one-reason-is-for-the-Boost-program-480x134.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boost is a discretionary incentive program available to qualifying independent brokerages, subject to eligibility requirements and approval.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Through a fair calculation, eXp Realty will PAY your independent brokerage to move to eXp and after you’re up and running for a year, eXp will provide you with another payment. Yep, it’s hard to beat this reason why brokerages are moving to eXp.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bottom line: Through a fair calculation, eXp Realty will PAY your independent brokerage to move to eXp, and after you’re up and running for a year, eXp will provide you with another payment. Yep, it’s hard to beat this reason why brokerages are moving to eXp.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here&#8217;s the rundown of what it takes to qualify for Boost:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cultural Symphony</strong>: Your brokerage needs to vibe with eXp’s culture, embodying a shared commitment to our values, growth aspirations, and vision.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No Franchise Strings Attached</strong>: This gig is for only the independents out there, free from ties to non-independent franchises.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Magic Number</strong>: If you&#8217;ve got a battalion of over 50 agents and have been rocking the sales charts with a minimum of $100 million in sales volume in your home country over the last year, you&#8217;re in the right league.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plus, there’s some wiggle room here, so contact us as we may be able to work some magic if you’re close to some of these metrics but don’t completely meet them!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"take-advantage-of-attraction-incentive-programs\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take Advantage of Attraction Incentive Programs</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if you don’t qualify for the Boost program, there&#8217;s another advantageous program encourages independent broker owners to join.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exps-thrive-program\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">eXp’s Thrive Program</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp Realty’s Thrive Program is similar to Boost, but it’s meant for teams, which all you smaller brokerages likely already have. Team leaders qualify for Thrive with just $40 million in production and 10-plus agents. Plus, like the Boost program, there’s some wiggle room here, so reach out to us to advocate for you!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-also-ask-about-why-brokerages-are-moving-to-e-xp\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About Why Brokerages Are Moving to eXp</h2>\n<h3 id=\"is-moving-a-brokerage-to-e-xp-the-same-as-selling-the-brokerage\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is moving a brokerage to eXp the same as selling the brokerage?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. Moving to eXp Realty is not a sale or acquisition. Broker-owners transition into associate broker roles while retaining their teams, leadership influence, and business relationships. Ownership equity in the original brokerage entity is not transferred, sold, or purchased by eXp.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-moving-a-brokerage-to-e-xp-the-same-as-selling-the-brokerage-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>Who is most likely to move their brokerage to eXp?</strong></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Independent broker-owners, small to mid-sized brokerages, and team-based firms are most likely to move. These groups typically seek to reduce legal liability and fixed overhead while maintaining autonomy, leadership roles, and the ability to scale beyond local geographic boundaries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-moving-a-brokerage-to-e-xp-the-same-as-selling-the-brokerage-1-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>Does moving to eXp require giving up brokerage branding?</strong></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. Broker-owners may retain their branding, team names, and marketing identity if they choose. eXp branding guidelines apply only when using company-branded materials, allowing owners to decide how prominently eXp appears in consumer-facing marketing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-moving-a-brokerage-to-e-xp-the-same-as-selling-the-brokerage-1-1-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>How does eXp compare to franchise brokerage models for owners?</strong></strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike franchise models, eXp does not charge franchise royalties or require physical offices. Broker-owners avoid layered fee structures while gaining centralized compliance, legal coverage, accounting, and a standardized compensation platform without maintaining independent brokerage infrastructure.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">eXp brokerage migration is designed to address broker-owner use cases such as liability reduction, overhead elimination, operational scalability, and long-term income diversification, but it does not operate in isolation or replace the broader brokerage experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-980x194.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-480x95.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713670163457\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Why are brokerages moving to eXp Realty?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Brokerages move to eXp Realty to reduce brokerage-level legal liability, eliminate fixed overhead like offices and staff, and simplify compliance operations. Broker-owners retain leadership influence and agent relationships while eXp assumes responsibility for transaction oversight, accounting, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713670172990\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Does eXp take ownership of a brokerage’s agents or database?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Agents affiliate individually with eXp Realty, and broker-owners do not transfer ownership of databases, contacts, or personal relationships. Recruitment and retention remain voluntary and relationship-driven rather than enforced through contracts, restrictive covenants, or proprietary ownership structures.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713670191845\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Can brokerages expand internationally after moving to eXp?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. eXp operates in all U.S. states and multiple international markets. Broker-owners can attract and support agents across borders without opening physical offices, forming independent legal entities, or navigating separate brokerage compliance structures in each country.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713670240966\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Does revenue share replace brokerage profit?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Revenue share does not replace production or sales income. It provides an additional compensation stream funded from eXp’s company dollar rather than agent commissions, allowing broker-owners to build recurring income alongside, not instead of, transactional revenue.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1713670277383\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Are incentive programs like Boost guaranteed?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Programs such as Boost, Accelerate, and Thrive are not guaranteed. Eligibility depends on production thresholds, agent count, cultural alignment, and program availability. Requirements may change over time and participation is subject to approval under current eXp program guidelines.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"related-e-xp-realty-fit-guides\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related eXp Realty Fit Guides</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/why-experienced-agents-join/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Experienced Agents Are Joining eXp Realty in 2026</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/teams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty Teams: How Structure, Splits, and Perks Work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/why-new-agents-join/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why So Many New Real Estate Agents Are Choosing eXp Realty</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Plus, since many other agents aren’t in the know, this is your chance to gain some competitive ground.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ignoring-local-seo-practices\">1. Ignoring Local SEO Practices</h3>\n<p>Harnessing the power of local SEO with your real estate social media marketing unlocks a secret level where potential nearby clients are effortlessly guided to your content.</p>\n<p>Real estate agents who skip this game-changing strategy overlook the magic of adding location tags or sprinkling their posts with local keywords, rendering them invisible to the very people who are searching for their services.</p>\n<p>Local SEO illuminates the path for local homebuyers and sellers straight to your doorstep. Infuse your content with mentions of your city, the charming neighborhoods you serve, and iconic landmarks that resonate with the local community. This isn&#8217;t just about being found; it&#8217;s about being found by those who matter most to your business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"not-prioritizing-video-content-on-all-social-media-platforms\">2. Not Prioritizing Video Content on All Social Media Platforms</h3>\n<p>Using video content across all social media platforms is not just a recommendation; it&#8217;s a game changer for real estate social media marketing. Despite this, a surprising number of realtors still don’t prioritize video content.</p>\n<p>From virtual tours that let viewers walk through properties to describing your local living benefits, to live Q&#038;A sessions that foster real-time interaction, videos offer a dynamic way to showcase your expertise far beyond what static images can achieve.</p>\n<p>Videos also provide a unique opportunity for you to connect directly with your audience, making your social media presence more engaging, personal, and relatable. By prioritizing video content, you&#8217;re building relationships and trust, showing that you&#8217;re not just a realtor but a guide through the complex journey of buying or selling a home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inconsistent-branding-across-platforms\">3. Inconsistent Branding Across Platforms</h3>\n<p>Elevating your real estate social media marketing demands unwavering consistency in your branding across every platform. A common pitfall for real estate agents is using mismatched profiles that fragment their brand identity. This inconsistency can lead to confusion among potential clients, diluting the impact of your marketing efforts.</p>\n<p>To build a consistent brand your logo, color scheme, and core messaging must be aligned across all your social media accounts. Consistency in real estate social media marketing is not just about aesthetics; it&#8217;s about crafting a seamless, trustworthy brand experience that draws clients to you, time and time again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"neglecting-engagement-with-followers\">4. Neglecting Engagement With Followers</h3>\n<p>Mastering real estate social media marketing hinges significantly on engagement. Failure to actively engage can significantly diminish your online presence. Ignoring comments, messages, or not participating in conversations on your social media pages projects an image of disinterest or gives the impression that you&#8217;re too preoccupied to help new clients.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4608 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d08c7246fae95fb8-3-6.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-6.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-6-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></p>\n<p>The secret to thriving on social media lies in your responsiveness. Make it a priority to interact with your audience by replying to comments, addressing inquiries promptly, and sparking meaningful discussions on your page. This proactive engagement is more than just courtesy; it&#8217;s a powerful strategy to nurture relationships, build trust, and create a vibrant community around your brand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sharing-information-without-permission\">5. Sharing Information Without Permission</h3>\n<p>This should be obvious, but it’s worth stating. In real estate social media marketing, the cardinal rule is respecting client confidentiality. Sharing any personal information without explicit permission is not just a faux pas; it&#8217;s a breach of trust and professionalism.</p>\n<p>Always ensure that you have obtained clear consent before featuring client stories, photos, or any specifics about their property transactions on your social media channels. This safeguards your clients&#8217; privacy and underscores your integrity as a realtor. In real estate social media marketing, trust is your most valuable asset—handle it with care.</p>\n<h3 id=\"not-avoiding-overpromotion\">6. Overpromoting</h3>\n<p>In real estate social media marketing, striking the right balance between promotion and providing value is crucial. The temptation to continuously spotlight your listings or services can be strong, but it&#8217;s essential to remember that overpromotion can repel potential clients rather than attract them. To navigate this delicate balance, adopt a strategy where for every self-promotional post, you provide four content posts that deliver pure value with no sales pitch attached.</p>\n<p>This 4:1 ratio of value to promotion ensures that your social media presence enriches your audience&#8217;s knowledge rather than bombarding them with advertisements. Value-driven content can range from educational articles that demystify the buying or selling process, insightful analyses of current market trends, practical home improvement tips that homeowners can apply, to showcasing the unique aspects of the communities you serve.</p>\n<p>By following this thoughtful approach, you position yourself as a knowledgeable and reliable resource in the real estate domain and ensure that when you do share promotional content, your audience is more receptive, viewing you not just as a salesperson but as a valued advisor in their real estate journey.</p>\n<h3>7. Providing Quantity Over Quality</h3>\n<p>Adopting a quality-over-quantity approach in real estate social media marketing is essential. Flooding your followers&#8217; feeds with incessant posts can lead to annoyance and disengagement. Instead, focus on curating a selection of high-quality, impactful content.</p>\n<p>This strategy enhances the visibility and effectiveness of all your real estate content efforts. This approach respects the time and attention of your followers and elevates your brand&#8217;s perception, making every post count.</p>\n<h3>8. Not Listening and Adapting</h3>\n<p>The mantra &#8220;listen and adapt&#8221; is not just advice—it&#8217;s a strategy for success in real estate social media. Feedback from your audience is a goldmine of insights, yet it&#8217;s astonishing how often this treasure trove is overlooked. Pay close attention to how your followers engage with various types of content. Their reactions and interactions are a direct line to understanding what resonates most effectively with them.</p>\n<p>By tailoring your content to align with the preferences and interests of your audience, you&#8217;re demonstrating a commitment to meeting their needs and interests. Additionally, embracing this adaptive strategy of making your content more impactful ensures that your social media presence is not static but evolves with your audience, keeping your brand relevant and engaging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"paid-advertising-for-real-estate-social-media-marketing\">Paid Advertising for Real Estate Social Media Marketing</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4606\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/efbd51d8a940965a-5.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"297\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5-300x89.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/5-768x228.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>There’s a right way and a wrong way to use paid advertising for social media. The wrong way is just a waste of your money and your time. Here are the benefits of paid advertising. Make sure you use it in a manner to get every single advantage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"targeted-exposure\">Real Estate Precision Targeting</h3>\n<p>Navigating the vast ocean of social media platforms is akin to attending a vast, global gala. With paid advertising, realtors gain the ability to pinpoint their ideal audience amidst the crowd, a critical strategy in real estate social media marketing. Precision targeting in real estate social media marketing is like having a fishing net that only captures the specific fish you want.</p>\n<p>You can advertise to people based on their interests or geographic location. Whether it&#8217;s someone with a penchant for browsing homes online or a resident of New York, your ads reach those who genuinely matter to your business.</p>\n<h3>Cost Efficiency in Real Estate Marketing</h3>\n<p>In real estate social media marketing, the beauty of social media advertising lies in its affordability. You can control how much you spend, setting the bounds of your advertising budget within your means and nothing more.</p>\n<p>When your ad campaign exceeds expectations, you&#8217;re at liberty to up your investment and extend your real estate advertisement’s reach. This approach ensures that your marketing dollars are spent wisely, maximizing exposure while adhering to your financial comfort zone.</p>\n<h3>Measurable Outcomes in Real Estate Social Media Marketing</h3>\n<p>When real estate agents invest in advertising, they need a clear understanding of return on investment. Luckily, social media platforms provide robust analytics tools, serving as a comprehensive dashboard for your marketing efforts.</p>\n<p>These analytics show invaluable insights into the performance of your ads making it clear which advertisements worked well and which were a bust. This data empowers real estate agents to refine their strategies, ensuring each dollar spent on social media advertising is most effective.</p>\n<h3>Boosted Engagement Through Real Estate Social Media Marketing</h3>\n<p>Social media ads in the real estate sector are far from static; they are interactive gateways that draw potential clients into a more immersive experience. Through real estate social media marketing, an advertisement can seamlessly transition viewers from casual observers to engaged prospects.</p>\n<p>Imagine you see an advertisement for a property that looks cool. With just a click, you can get a virtual tour, providing an immediate, in-depth look at the home. This immediate feedback enhances the user experience and significantly increases the likelihood of engagement, moving potential prospects one step closer to being your client.</p>\n<h3>A Dirty Little Secret</h3>\n<p>Though we can’t confirm this, it&#8217;s a logical assumption that social media platforms tend to favor content creators who invest in advertising. Given the underlying profit-driven motives of these platforms, they might prioritize or enhance the visibility of content from paying advertisers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap!</h2>\n<p>In wrapping up, real estate social media marketing is like unlocking a treasure trove of opportunities.

Still, it’s likely this most vulnerable group might opt to navigate the homebuying process alone to serve their short-term interests of saving on agent fees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-maybe-no-more-free-real-estate-agents\">2. Maybe No More “Free” Real Estate Agents</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5611\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/09807bbce03e5554-2-6.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"321\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-6.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-6-300x96.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-6-768x247.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Real estate industry changes could flip the script on how real estate agents are paid, potentially ending the era of &#8220;free&#8221; agents who only get paid upon closing a deal.</p>\n<p>After all, real estate agents invest heavily in their profession.  They pay huge splits of their earned commissions to their brokerages and their referral partners.  They pay extensive expenses to professional associations, for ongoing education, and for regular business expenses (like car expenses, transaction coordinators, editors, and the like).  Agents pay to advertise for new customers, and it costs agents plenty of money and time to get repeat customer business too.</p>\n<p>Agents pay all these expenses while putting in weeks, months, and sometimes years for their clients, all without any guaranteed pay. If a house doesn’t sell or a homebuyer changes their mind, agents get no money for their sacrifices.  What other profession does this?</p>\n<p>Considering agent risk and real estate industry changes, this unique real estate business model could be reevaluated.  Maybe agents in the future will be paid more like other professions that don’t provide more than one free consultation before remuneration for services rendered is due.</p>\n<p>Real estate clients might start to need to pay agents for their time and advice regardless of a home purchase or home sale.  That result would recognize the extensive professional services real estate agents offer to homebuyers and home sellers throughout the transaction process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-maybe-higher-listing-commissions\">3.

Listing agents could end up raking in higher commissions. Yep, you heard that right! Without the usual army of buyer agents showing off properties left and right, listing agents might have to step up to the plate and do more property tours themselves.</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker: only licensed agents can legally show homes. So, listing agents might find themselves juggling a whole lot more, which could totally justify bumping up their commission payment rates. It&#8217;s like trying to cut down on one expense, only to find yourself shelling out more in the long run. Who would&#8217;ve thought, right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-maybe-traditional-brokerages-fail\">4.

With estimated damages expected to be over $5 billion and no end in sight, brace yourselves for a brokerage crisis hitting just when brokerages are already struggling with a lot fewer real estate transactions.</p>\n<p>In this new world, agents better strap in for less success too thanks to DIY homebuyers and potentially shrinking commissions. And as for traditional brokerages? Already losing 100s of millions of dollars, they might raise agent fees or they just may go bankrupt.</p>\n<p>The future of real estate agents lies in moving to financially resilient brokerage models, like the cloud-based platform offered by <a href=\"/exp-realty-explained-in-9-minutes/\">eXp Realty</a>. Renowned as the only profitable independent brokerage in 2022 and hailed as the fastest-growing brokerage globally, eXp Realty will survive the crisis and its agents will continue to thrive.</p>\n<p>Echoing this sentiment, <a href=\"https://www.mikedp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike DelPrete</a>, a prominent global real estate tech strategist, asserts that &#8220;clarity is emerging on the shifting brokerage landscape,&#8221; and traditional brokerages are already witnessing an exodus of agents seeking refuge in more lucrative and streamlined models like eXp Realty.</p>\n<p>So, buckle up! The future of real estate is changing, and those who hitch their wagon to innovative models like eXp Realty are set to ride the wave of success.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-maybe-not-enough-buyer-agents\">5.

That new agent need may scare off part-timers or hobbyists from sticking around. And, if compensation takes a nosedive, thanks to those ongoing battles, more agents might pack up and leave for greener pastures.</p>\n<p>But hold onto your hats, because things could get even crazier! Analysts predict that lower fees could send up to 80 percent of buyer agents running for the hills. Imagine a world with a shortage of this many agents, leaving home buyers to fend for themselves in the wilderness of the internet.</p>\n<p>Without buyer agents to steer them right, even homebuyers who want a buyer agent might find themselves either unable to secure one or, ironically, the cost of buyer agents could rise and more homebuyers may be priced out. In those cases, homebuyers will need to rely more on the internet and a potential sea of misinformation all while risking their investments on shaky ground.</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-no-effect-to-industry-costs\">6.

It&#8217;s a game of give and take.

With their slick websites and legal jargon, these online listers are not exactly playing by the same rules as your local buyer agent.</p>\n<p>See, buyer agents have a sworn duty to always put their clients first, but these online listing companies, not so much. Sure, those online platforms might seem like a dream with their easy browsing and quick info, but homebuyers beware! You’ll need to really dig into the fine print.</p>\n<p>Failure to do so could leave homebuyers vulnerable to unforeseen challenges or disadvantages that may arise from an online property listing company&#8217;s focus on protecting its own interests.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8-off-market-property-broker-dominance\">8.

These secret listings are like hidden treasures, only accessible if you&#8217;ve got a buyer agent in your corner.</p>\n<p>But hold on a second! While Off-Market properties might sound cool, they come with a catch. With fewer options on the table, buyers might feel like they&#8217;re shopping in a tiny pond instead of a big ocean. Plus, the whole secret deal thing? It&#8217;s not exactly reassuring for homebuyers who want transparency.</p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s the kicker: relying too much on Off-Market listings could throw us all right back in the old days when you had to cozy up to a real estate agent just to find out what was for sale.

In the meantime, some MLS listings are already showing zero as the amount offered to the buyer agent.</p>\n<p>This potential shift poses a significant challenge, particularly for agents who are not adequately prepared for such a change. Those without a buyer representation contract could be left empty-handed even after already dedicating loads of time and money working for a client.</p>\n<p>Read our other topical blogs, particularly “Buyer Agents Must Act Now &#8211; Sellers No Longer to Pay Buyer Agents” to navigate this new changing real estate landscape.</p>\n<h2 id=\"10-more-far-reaching-consequences-than-anticipated\">10.

But if the commission game changes or transactions take a hit, these teams might find themselves on shaky ground. Cue the dramatic music—job losses and less support for homebuyers could be on the horizon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"online-data-providers\">Online Data Providers</h3>\n<p>Think of Zillow and Realtor.com as the Google Maps of house hunting. They thrive on a bustling army of buyer agents laying out cash to buy leads.  But if brokerages start shrinking or shutting their doors, and agents thin out, these platforms might find themselves in a bit of a pickle. Fewer agents mean fewer customers, and that spells trouble for their bottom line.</p>\n<h3 id=\"small-lenders\">Small Lenders</h3>\n<p>Lenders, who traditionally partner with real estate agents to offer financing options to homebuyers, could also be impacted. If the real estate buyer agent scene starts to sputter, they could feel the pinch too. Less agent action means fewer referrals, leaving these small lenders high and dry. Imagine the domino effect: less competition for mortgage originators means a less competitive mortgage market, which could mean steeper costs for homebuyers to nab a loan.</p>\n<p>So, as you can see, the real estate drama isn&#8217;t just confined to the agents and brokers—it&#8217;s a whole tangled web of connections that could lead to some serious plot twists in the market.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, real estate agents are about to embark on an epic adventure filled with twists, turns, and plot twists galore! With legal battles raging and industry norms shifting, it&#8217;s time to brace yourselves for some serious action.</p>\n<p>But fear not, fellow agents, for amid chaos lies opportunity! So grab your popcorn, strap in, and get ready to rewrite the script of real estate history. It&#8217;s going to be a wild ride, but with courage, creativity, and a dash of humor, we&#8217;ll emerge victorious in this thrilling saga of change!</p>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more-about-exp-realty-and-our-free-sponsor-team\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<h2 id=\"join-our-free-group-at-exp-realty\"> <strong>Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</strong></h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"/exp-realty-sponsor/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Therefore, the seller often covers this fee, but industry changes could shake this up</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-was-the-impact-of-a-landmark-court-loss-on-buyer-agent-commissions\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What was the impact of a landmark court loss on buyer agent commissions?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\"><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/law-and-ethics/breaking-down-sitzer-burnett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This court case</a> was a game-changer, putting pressure on traditional commission structures and potentially reducing how much buyer agents pocket from home sales.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-department-of-justice-doj-statement-affect-buyer-agents\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How does the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-02/420087.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Justice (DOJ) statement</a> affect buyer agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The DOJ&#8217;s aims to make real estate transactions more transparent. Buyer agents will need to adapt to clearer commission disclosures and possibly tighter competition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-do-to-prepare-for-industry-changes-as-a-buyer-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What should buyer agents do to prepare for industry changes?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Stay informed and flexible. Brush up your Buyer Presentation skills. Embrace technology, enhance your negotiation skills, and consider diversifying your services. The goal? To stay valuable no matter how the market shifts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-unintended-consequences-of-payment-shifts-in-real-estate\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What are some unintended consequences of payment shifts in real estate?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Shifts towards buyer-paid commissions could lead buyers to bargain harder or skip out on using an agent altogether. That is, it’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. In other words, learn to clarify your value!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How do real estate agents typically receive their payments?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Traditionally, a home transaction closing triggers the payment to agents.  The closing statement accounts for the commission payment as part of its details.  After the close, the escrow officer sends the commission to each agent&#8217;s broker &#8211; who then disburses it to the agents after deducting for their fees (splits).</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average income for a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. However, location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full-time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average real estate agent commission charge?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Typically, the buying and selling agents equally share the average US commission, which is generally 5% to 6% of a property’s total sale price.  These numbers vary between locations, different agents, and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Does an agent&#8217;s brokerage pay the entire commission to the agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Most likely, no. That’s because most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Can I negotiate my realtor’s commission rate?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. Therefore, you should discuss the commission before signing any agreement</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">However, note that some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">When do real estate agents receive their commission?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Agents receive their commissions upon the closing of deals. Therefore, they do not receive any payment for their time or expenses until after the deals close. You might say that real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency. Lawyers who work on contingency are also paid upon the completion of successful court cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How much do real estate agents make if the house doesn’t sell?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Generally, nothing. The agent is not compensated for their time or their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Do brokerages pay real estate agents a monthly salary?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals. Instead, agents earn their pay when they successfully close a deal.  However, some brokers pay agents a salary, but not generally.</p>\n",

Yes, the real estate business is hitting a major shift, but it’s our golden ticket to clear up some big public misconceptions.</p>\n<p>For example, the general public does not understand that most real estate agents are not paid anything for the time and expenses that they devote to clients &#8211; time that can run days, weeks, months, and years and expenses that are in the 4-figure range.</p>\n<p>Agents are not paid by their brokerages, as the public seems to presume, for their time or expenses.  Instead, agents earn nothing if a deal doesn’t close.</p>\n<p>In our buyer presentations, let’s take the opportunity to explain the realities of our risky profession. After all, what other job has someone hustling non-stop, shelling out their own cash, with absolutely no promise of a paycheck?</p>\n<p>Here’s the only one I can think of &#8211; lawyers working on contingency.  Lawyers working on contingency cases don&#8217;t see a cent unless they win damages in a case. But when those contingency lawyers win a case, they pull in way more than their usual fees. That&#8217;s their gamble paying off – a fat paycheck for the win, balancing out the gigs that don’t pay off anything at all.</p>\n<h3 id=\"its-a-contingency-higher-risk-job\">It’s a Contingency Higher-Risk Job</h3>\n<p>And hey, us real estate agents? We’re in the same boat. We’re out there, investing time and money, not knowing if it&#8217;ll ever pay off. But when it does, we&#8217;re talking about a payday that currently makes it worth our risk.</p>\n<p>But let’s face it. The general public loves that agents work for free UNLESS their home transaction closes. And yet now the public also wants to lower buyer agent commission which does not account for the risks we all take.  Basically, the general public wants to have their cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p>Armed with the comforting knowledge that professions that take on more risk are better paid when their risk pays off, it’s time for buyer agents to set the record straight.  In buyer presentations and the next time someone tells you real estate agents are overpaid, break it down for them.</p>\n<p>Agents aren’t just throwing out their cash and clocking in hours, weeks, and months for kicks and fun. Real estate agents take on significant risks and the only way to make it worth our while is by ensuring the pot at the end of the rainbow reflects that added risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exploring-future-innovative-compensation-structures\">Exploring Future Innovative Compensation Structures</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5628\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/f3aa9301c53ebfc2-76357.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"365\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/76357.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/76357-300x110.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/76357-768x280.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Okay, so we&#8217;ve laid it all out about the gamble agents take. But what if people out there still think agents are paid too much?  In that case, it&#8217;s prime time for us agents to shake things up. Our buyer presentations are our golden ticket to rethink and maybe even reinvent how we get paid.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re talking about fine-tuning our fees so they&#8217;re spot-on with the real deal we bring to the table, making sure it&#8217;s a win-win for us and the homebuyers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all about getting that balance just right, where what we charge is a clear reflection of our worth and the peace of mind we provide to our clients. Here are some ideas of how agents might reinvent their career compensation:</p>\n<h3 id=\"pick-your-package-with-tiered-service-models\">Pick-Your-Package with Tiered Service Models</h3>\n<p>Think about giving power to clients while protecting your right to earn compensation by providing a snazzy tiered service lineup. Clients would get to pick from a variety of service bundles you create with each bundle being packed with its own unique features and priced just right.</p>\n<p>Clients could match what they need (and what they want to spend) with the services you rock at. And you? You get to tailor your compensation to the real sweat, skill, and savvy you pour into service. It&#8217;s all about flexibility, choice, and making sure everyone&#8217;s getting the value they deserve.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flat-fee-services-with-one-price-wonders\">Flat Fee Services with One-Price Wonders</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5629 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/90427ef818fc7351-2323.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2323.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2323-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></p>\n<p>Here clients can dive into the world of clear-cut, no-surprises pricing with a fabulous menu of flat-fee services! This is where simplicity meets satisfaction, perfect for clients who love sticking to their budget and adore the peace of mind that comes with upfront pricing.</p>\n<p>Lay out your services buffet-style, letting clients pick what they crave, all at a fixed, transparent price. It&#8217;s your ticket to setting crystal-clear expectations and spicing up your offerings, all while drawing in a diverse crowd who’s all about value, clarity, and straightforward real estate magic.</p>\n<h3 id=\"time-is-money-literally-with-hourly-compensation\">Time is Money, Literally, With Hourly Compensation</h3>\n<p>Shifting gears to an hourly compensation model could totally revolutionize the real estate game. Think about it – getting paid for every hour you pour your heart and expertise into, especially when navigating those high-maintenance or intricate deals.</p>\n<p>It’s the ultimate transparency move, putting a clear price tag on your invaluable time and smarts. However, brace yourself – we’re in for a marathon, not a sprint. Convincing homebuyers, who are traditionally used to the freebie service until closing day, to start paying by the hour?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s going to be an uphill battle. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen, so consider the ways you might move the idea along.</p>\n<h3 id=\"incentives-unleashed-performance-pays-off-with-performance-based-packages\">Incentives Unleashed: Performance Pays Off with Performance–Based Packages</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5630 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d0b81941f5e0e19f-333333.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/333333.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/333333-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></p>\n<p>Imagine compensation packages tailored to reward your hard work and exceptional outcomes. We’re talking about a setup where your commitment and success in navigating intricate, demanding transactions directly boost your earnings.</p>\n<p>You start with a baseline fee, but here’s the kicker – your client rewards you extra for hitting those key performance milestones that matter most to them.</p>\n<p>This setup not only aligns your buyer agent commission with your achievements but also ensures clients receive top-notch service, knowing their investment translates directly into value. It’s a win-win where your skill and success directly influence your compensation, guaranteeing that both you and your clients come out ahead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"exploring-new-horizons-in-compensation-strategies\">Exploring New Horizons in Compensation Strategies</h3>\n<p>This list of possible compensation structures is only the beginning.  The landscape of buyer agent compensation is ripe for innovation, presenting a kaleidoscope of cool, innovative buyer agent commission models that could totally reshape agent fees in the future.</p>\n<p>Embrace the opportunity to be the architect of your agent income by designing a reward system that’s as satisfying and innovative as snagging the perfect property for your client!</p>\n<h2 id=\"getting-back-to-real-estate-agent-basics\">Getting Back to Real Estate Agent Basics</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5631\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/701904fb824b00ef-444444.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"367\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/444444.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/444444-300x110.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/444444-768x282.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></p>\n<p>Defending why agents are paid well and considering new compensation structures is paramount but there’s more.</p>\n<p>In the new real estate industry world where buyer agents will likely do buyer presentations to explain agent value, they will also need to get back to the basics to compete with other agents.  Agents need to reinforce their foundational skills and strategies.

That is, it’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. In other words, learn to clarify your value!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How do real estate agents typically receive their payments?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Traditionally, a home transaction closing triggers the payment to agents.  The closing statement accounts for the commission payment as part of its details.  After the close, the escrow officer sends the commission to each agent&#8217;s broker &#8211; who then disburses it to the agents after deducting for their fees (splits).</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average income for a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. However, location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full-time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What is the average real estate agent commission charge?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Typically, the buying and selling agents equally share the average US commission, which is generally 5% to 6% of a property’s total sale price.  These numbers vary between locations, different agents, and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Does an agent&#8217;s brokerage pay the entire commission to the agent?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Most likely, no. That’s because most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Can I negotiate my realtor’s commission rate?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. Therefore, you should discuss the commission before signing any agreement</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">However, note that some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\" class=\"pm-align--left\">When do real estate agents receive their commission?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Agents receive their commissions upon the closing of deals. Therefore, they do not receive any payment for their time or expenses until after the deals close. You might say that real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency. Lawyers who work on contingency are also paid upon the completion of successful court cases.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\" class=\"pm-align--left\">How much do real estate agents make if the house doesn’t sell?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Generally, nothing. The agent is not compensated for their time or their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\" class=\"pm-align--left\">Do brokerages pay real estate agents a salary monthly?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals. Instead, agents earn their pay when they successfully close a deal.  However, some brokers pay agents a salary, but not generally.</p>\n",
