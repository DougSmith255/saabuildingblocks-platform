Consider these scripts to be your open house GPS, leading you successfully through every turn. This is why having great, effective scripts is so important.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Most importantly, it allows you to customize your approach when engaging with various types of visitors, from first-time homebuyers to experienced investors. This flexibility often results in faster time to clients and improved client follow-up. Good scripts read like a conversation, putting people at ease, and allowing you to establish rapport with potential buyers, making them feel comfortable and important.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Implementing open house scripts will remove the fear of first contact, increasing your confidence with any outcome. They’re great for testing interest, fielding tough questions, and making sure you collect critical contact info so you don’t miss out on a follow-up.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Scripts provide a time-efficient approach to prospecting so you can make many more calls in less time. Digital sign-in sheets are an even easier way to add leads directly into your database.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"greeting-visitors\">Greeting Visitors</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Creating a welcoming atmosphere at an open house starts with a few essential elements:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A friendly smile and eye contact</li>\n<li>An engaging tone to set a comforting mood</li>\n<li>Personalized greetings using visitor names when possible</li>\n<li>An invitation to explore the property freely</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-start-with-a-warm-welcome\">1. Start with a Warm Welcome</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Start with a personal introduction, including your name and position. Invite visitors to submit inquiries or express what they would like to see featured.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Open gestures, smiling, nodding, and leaning forward all communicate approachability. Providing drinks or light refreshments adds to the atmosphere of friendliness and openness.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-set-up-an-information-station\">2. Set Up an Information Station</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">An information station should have pamphlets, property sheets, and business cards at minimum. A simple voluntary sign-up sheet goes a long way in collecting contact information.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Share neighborhood highlights and market trends to reel them in. Graphically design everything to be eye-catching, generating interest and excitement that leads to follow through.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-conduct-an-initial-friendly-meeting\">3. Conduct an Initial Friendly Meeting</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Engage with visitors and show true empathy for their home search. Follow-up with open-ended questions in order to figure out what they need.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Then really listen, to earn their trust. Keep meetings fun to make a great first impression.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"engaging-potential-buyers\">Engaging Potential Buyers</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"238\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d058ac2a8fc5424-Open-House-Scripts-Engaging-Potential-Buyers.webp/public\" alt=\"Open House Scripts, Engaging Potential Buyers\" class=\"wp-image-264826\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Scripts-Engaging-Potential-Buyers.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Scripts-Engaging-Potential-Buyers-300x71.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Scripts-Engaging-Potential-Buyers-768x183.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-explore-search-criteria\">1. Explore Search Criteria</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Getting to the bottom of what potential buyers need is integral to really connecting with them and keeping their attention while showing an open house. It can be useful to have a prepared list of questions to draw out what their priorities are in a search. Start by determining which neighborhoods or areas they are looking for specifically.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Next, discuss their ideal bedroom and bathroom count, as well as must-have home or community amenities. Here’s a list of factors to consider. Identifying any special needs such as accessibility or yard space is essential. This knowledge doesn’t just leave you better-informed; it helps focus subsequent property recommendations and improve follow-up conversations.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By using open house scripts, you know you’re going to hit all the key points and do so with confidence. This strategy leaves an impressive first impression, making serious buyers out of tire kickers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-paint-a-future-vision\">2. Paint a Future Vision</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Painting a colorful picture of daily life in the house and community draws in those potential buyers. Share exciting narratives about living in the area, describing community events, local amenities, and lifestyle benefits.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Use descriptive language to get them picturing what it’ll be like to host parties or spend quality time with their family in the new space. This storytelling technique creates an authentically personal bond and puts them in a comfortable place. Scripts take the guesswork out of these discussions, alleviating pressure and increasing confidence no matter the scenario.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-assess-wishlist-items\">3. Assess Wishlist Items</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A deep dive into what today’s buyers are looking for in a home is imperative. Create a wishlist item scorecard. List them all from big kitchen to big yard, then put the most important ones first.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By doing this, it allows them to focus their search on properties that fit their needs. Coming back to these items in follow-up conversations demonstrates that you are listening and paying attention to their needs.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Even if potential buyers aren’t showing interest at first, they can still turn into qualified leads, making your next sale possible. After all, nearly 80% of homebuyers start their search online. Make sure you’re prepared to respond to objections, like yard size and neighborhood features, in a positive manner.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"handling-casual-lookers\">Handling Casual Lookers</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0e821d2246f80004-Open-House-Scripts-Handling-Casual-Lookers.webp/public\" alt=\"Open House Scripts, Handling Casual Lookers\" class=\"wp-image-264827\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Scripts-Handling-Casual-Lookers.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Scripts-Handling-Casual-Lookers-300x60.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Scripts-Handling-Casual-Lookers-768x154.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When you’re faced with casual lookers at an open house, the trick is to make the conversation without being pushy. Here’s a list of strategies to help with that:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use casual fun discussion starters to gauge serious interest.</li>\n<li>Share important information about the property while allowing them to discover it on their own.</li>\n<li>Encourage questions and let them know you are available to assist them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-checkin-with-neighbors\">1. Check-In with Neighbors</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Begin by greeting prospective neighbors with a friendly grin and a casual come hither. Share insights about neighborhood benefits and recent developments.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Invite them to share their story, which not only builds rapport with the audience but helps capture leads from those who may know someone looking to buy.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-engage-curiosity-seekers\">2. Engage Curiosity Seekers</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When people are only lookie-looing, don’t fight it—meet them where they’re at. Provide them with cool, fun, or strange facts to get them intrigued and get them asking questions.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Turn their curiosity to your advantage by drawing attention to the home’s best attributes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-inspire-with-ideas\">3. Inspire with Ideas</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Provide inventive ideas for customizing the area or future improvements. Share success stories of buyers who renovated completed similar homes and benefited from the same.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Help visitors imagine themselves and their aesthetic in the house.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"following-up-after-open-houses\">Following Up After Open Houses</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Treating these follow-up steps as a core component of each open house is the start of turning more leads into clients. Here’s a bullet list of strategies to keep the momentum moving in the right direction:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Thank attendees for visiting and invite them to ask any questions.</li>\n<li>Schedule follow-up calls within a day to get your new prospects’ thoughts on the property and discuss next steps.</li>\n<li>Send them other properties or information that match what they’ve said they’re looking for.</li>\n<li>Follow up through multiple channels phone, email, text, social media.</li>\n<li>Follow up with a short text message after the call thanking them again and letting them know you’re excited to move forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-extend-an-open-invitation\">1. Extend an Open Invitation</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Make sure your communication lines are open for any questions or future showings. Extending an offer to schedule private showings for properties meeting their criteria helps leave the door ajar.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Remind them to call you when they have friends or relatives in the market for a home, too — this is a good way to stay in touch. Keeping the tone friendly might make the next communications more friendly as well.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-provide-real-estate-expertise\">2. Provide Real Estate Expertise</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Helping them understand today’s market conditions and pricing trends will make you a trusted source and authority. Providing useful advice about how to approach the home-buying journey while showing your years of wisdom establishes trust and authority.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Keep in mind that 80% of sales are made between the 5th and 12th contact, so diligent follow-up is essential.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"addressing-buyer-concerns\">Addressing Buyer Concerns</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"218\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e5b45bbda8616fc5-Addressing-Buyer-Concerns.webp/public\" alt=\"Addressing Buyer Concerns\" class=\"wp-image-264830\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Addressing-Buyer-Concerns.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Addressing-Buyer-Concerns-300x65.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Addressing-Buyer-Concerns-768x167.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Making your open house a welcoming environment starts with addressing buyer concerns before they even walk through the door. Here&#8217;s a bullet list of common concerns to address proactively:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Price and affordability</li>\n<li>Condition of the property</li>\n<li>Neighborhood safety and amenities</li>\n<li>Potential for future value increase</li>\n<li>Proximity to schools and workplaces</li>\n<li>Commute times and public transportation options</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Being able to listen closely to concerns or objections in the middle of a call or meeting is incredibly important. Giving a direct and forthright answer quickly takes the wind out of their concerns or confusion.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Address buyer concerns. Show buyers that you’re committed to helping them find their ideal home, and you’ll win their trust by demonstrating empathy and understanding.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Share Neighborhood Insights</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Talking about local amenities, schools, parks and community events further paints a picture that makes living in the area highly desirable. Data on safety and demographic breakdowns help to instill confidence.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Showcase testimonials from existing residents focusing on the happy moments. Emphasize positive future changes that will add to appreciation.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Discuss House Condition Queries</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Be ready to discuss the home’s age, maintenance history, and any repairs that have been done. Show your strengths, but don’t hide the ball—be honest about weaknesses.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Provide any available documentation about the property’s condition. Incentivize buyers to look at homes with improvement or renovation potential.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"turning-neighbors-into-leads\">Turning Neighbors into Leads</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Engaging neighbors when they attend an open house is a savvy tactic for converting them into a future lead. Here are some strategies:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Share details about the property’s features and benefits.</li>\n<li>Provide individual tours around the open house to field questions.</li>\n<li>Highlight the neighborhood’s unique selling points.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-offer-market-value-discussions\">1. Offer Market Value Discussions</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Having honest conversations about your local market can be a difference maker. Providing information on recent sales and their impact on local property values can create a buzz.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This type of simple conversation makes you sound like the wise old real estate guru.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">As the date approaches, reach out to homeowners to remind them of the Open House, targeting a three to four block radius from your listing.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Make sure you stay in touch with them post-event, because turning a first-meeting handshake into a relationship can unlock many opportunities. Yet only 4% of agents send them, creating a huge opportunity.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"collecting-visitor-information\">Collecting Visitor Information</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Collecting visitor information at an open house is critical to developing a great contact list for future outreach. Here are some efficient methods to consider:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Implement digital sign-in methods such as tablets or mobile apps like Curb Hero to provide a more efficient experience.</li>\n<li>Provide explicit directions on what information they should provide, like their names, emails, and phone numbers.</li>\n<li>Offer something enticing such as raffle entries to encourage visitors to provide their contact details.</li>\n<li>Protect the privacy of all data collected, making it clear to potential visitors why they should share their information.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"use-efficient-signin-methods\">Use Efficient Sign-In Methods</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A digital sign-in app is quicker and easier to use, which means you’re collecting many more leads, including the “just browsing” ones. Syncing these leads with a real estate CRM allows you to follow up quickly and make the most of every visitor.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Keeping an eye on sign-in trends allows us to more effectively adjust our efforts moving forward.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"learn-about-attendee-interests\">Learn About Attendee Interests</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Consider questions like the following to dig deep and learn more about what visitors really need and their timeframes. Use this information to customize follow-ups and recommend properties that best match their expressed interests.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This approach increases your chances of making successful connections.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"objection-handling-strategies\">Objection Handling Strategies</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"address-common-buyer-objections\">Address Common Buyer Objections</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The key to handling buyer objections at your open house is preparation and empathy. Here&#8217;s a bullet list of common objections and effective responses to address them:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Show them what the market is doing and provide apples-to-apples comps.</li>\n<li>Promote the positive features of the community, like good schools or nearby parks.</li>\n<li>Propose modifications or similar options in the area if the existing property doesn’t fit their needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When you know what everyone’s worried about, it makes it way easier to turn objections into opportunities. Use empathetic listening to validate their feelings, giving them reassurance that you will always have their best interests in mind.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Share objective data, such as sales data from the prior year, and use it to make your case while fostering a conversation. This strategy makes buyers feel heard and understood, which builds trust. Sending along further information, such as market intelligence reports, serves to further establish your in-depth knowledge of the industry.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"best-practices-for-scripting\">Best Practices for Scripting</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Creating effective open house scripts involves several key practices:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep messages concise to focus on essential details.</li>\n<li>Use natural language that reflects your personal style.</li>\n<li>Regularly update scripts based on feedback and market trends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"maintain-a-conversational-tone\">Maintain a Conversational Tone</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A conversational tone is very important. This is where you can use humor or relatable stories to help lighten the mood.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Don’t use jargon that will lose your audience. The idea is to develop connections, not make the hard sale.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"adapt-to-different-situations\">Adapt to Different Situations</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Here&#8217;s a bullet list of situations where change is needed:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Serious buyers vs. casual lookers</li>\n<li>Unexpected questions or comments</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Be flexible and adjust based on visitor comfort.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"emphasize-key-benefits\">Emphasize Key Benefits</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Make sure to call out standout property features and how they align with buyer needs. Concentrate on making sure they are working with you as their buyer’s agent.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Avoid jargon, and use engaging, persuasive language to drum up excitement.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Open house scripts are a must-have for real estate agents.

Rather than functioning as a general contractor for major structural projects, Curbio focuses on defined cosmetic updates that are commonly addressed prior to listing, such as interior paint, flooring replacement, kitchen and bathroom refreshes, and exterior curb appeal improvements.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">These renovations are selected based on scope guidelines and market considerations, with project management handled by Curbio. Agents often evaluate this approach as a way to address visible condition issues and standardize listing readiness without managing contractors or renovation logistics directly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-nationwide-partner-for-exp-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Curbio Availability And Market Coverage</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://life.exprealty.com/exp-partner-curbio-home-improvement/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curbio operates nationwide through its exclusive partnership with eXp Realty</a>, making it available to agents in most U.S. cities. This widespread availability ensures that eXp agents can confidently offer pre-sale home improvements to sellers, knowing they have a trusted partner to handle every aspect of the process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-seamless-prelisting-renovation-process\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">How The Pre-Listing Renovation Process Works</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">From the moment an agent submits a project request, the process is seamless. A team of pre-listing experts conducts an in-home consultation to determine the most valuable updates. There’s no guesswork—every recommendation is backed by data to maximize a seller’s return on investment. By focusing on upgrades that buyers actually want, Curbio helps eXp agents ensure that their listings stand out in the market.</p>\n<h3 id=\"endtoend-project-management-for-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">End-to-End Project Management for Agents</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Once the scope of work is approved, a dedicated project manager takes over. They handle everything—coordinating vetted contractors, sourcing materials, overseeing timelines, and sending real-time updates through Curbio’s app. This level of support means eXp agents never have to deal with subcontractor scheduling, permit tracking, or unexpected delays. Everything is managed through <a href=\"https://curbio.com/mobile-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curbio’s intuitive platform</a>, providing a completely hands-off experience for agents and their sellers. With Curbio in place, agents can focus on selling homes rather than managing renovations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-curbio-empowers-exp-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">How Agents Evaluate Curbio For Listing Preparation</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d290fe00d15fa486-How-Curbio-Empowers-eXp-Agents.webp/public\" alt=\"How Curbio Empowers eXp Agents\" class=\"wp-image-265332\" width=\"1000\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-Curbio-Empowers-eXp-Agents.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-Curbio-Empowers-eXp-Agents-980x223.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-Curbio-Empowers-eXp-Agents-480x109.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">For eXp agents, Curbio is a game-changer. The ability to offer sellers a fully managed, pay-at-close renovation solution makes an agent more than just a transaction facilitator—it positions them as a trusted advisor. By eliminating the upfront cost barrier for sellers, agents ensure homes are market-ready without financial roadblocks. This service alone sets eXp agents apart, transforming the way they attract and close listings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-competitive-edge-in-the-market\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">How Renovation Preparation Can Affect Listing Strategy</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Curbio provides an undeniable competitive edge. While other agents are scrambling to coordinate handymen and contractors, eXp agents using Curbio can promote “sell-ready homes” with professionally managed updates and no out-of-pocket expenses for the seller. This can help turn leads into clients. With Curbio’s nationwide network, agents can take on properties in any condition, knowing that renovations will be expertly handled.</p>\n<h3 id=\"scaling-without-the-hassle\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Scaling Without the Hassle</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://go.curbio.com/exp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">With Curbio managing every aspect of the pre-sale renovation process</a>, eXp agents can confidently take on more listings without stretching themselves too thin. Whether a home needs a quick refresh or a full-scale cosmetic update, agents know they have a reliable partner to get the job done efficiently and effectively. This allows them to focus on growing their business rather than managing the complexities of home improvement projects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"futureproofing-an-agents-business\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">How Pre-Listing Updates Fit Into Long-Term Listing Strategies</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Beyond just selling homes, Curbio helps agents future-proof their business. Buyers increasingly expect move-in-ready homes, and outdated listings struggle to compete. With Curbio, agents ensure that their listings align with current market demands, helping them close deals faster and more profitably. The impact extends beyond a single transaction—sellers appreciate the ease of the process, leading to more referrals and a reputation as the agent who delivers results without hassle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"curbio-benefits-for-home-sellers\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Curbio Benefits for Home Sellers</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/65d4b9b2b9d32bc7-Curbio-Benefits-for-Home-Sellers.webp/public\" alt=\"Curbio Benefits for Home Sellers\" class=\"wp-image-265331\" width=\"1000\" height=\"207\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Curbio-Benefits-for-Home-Sellers.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Curbio-Benefits-for-Home-Sellers-980x203.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Curbio-Benefits-for-Home-Sellers-480x99.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Sellers also gain significant advantages from Curbio’s model, making the home-selling process smoother, more profitable, and stress-free. By eliminating upfront renovation costs and providing full project management, Curbio helps sellers maximize their home’s value while minimizing hassle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"financial-flexibility-without-upfront-costs\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Financial Flexibility Without Upfront Costs</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Financially, Curbio is a game-changer for home sellers. Instead of paying out-of-pocket for renovations, sellers can leverage their home’s equity to fund the improvements, with no payment required until closing. Interest is only charged during the renovation period, and the full balance is paid at closing. </p>\n<h3 id=\"a-stressfree-home-improvement-experience\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">A Stress-Free Home Improvement Experience</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Curbio also eliminates the stress that typically comes with preparing a home for sale. Homeowners no longer have to worry about managing multiple contractors, tracking down materials, or navigating renovation timelines. With a dedicated project manager overseeing everything from start to finish, sellers can focus on their next move while Curbio ensures their home is market-ready.</p>\n<h3 id=\"faster-turnaround-for-a-more-competitive-listing\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Faster Turnaround for a More Competitive Listing</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Efficiency is key in today’s fast-moving market, and Curbio helps sellers get their homes listed without delay. The streamlined project management process ensures that renovations don’t drag on, reducing the risk of a property sitting on the market and losing value. </p>\n<h2 id=\"why-choose-curbio-for-renovations\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">How Curbio Differs From Traditional Contractor Coordination</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/dd10d6366ab9b9e1-Why-Choose-Curbio-for-Renovations.webp/public\" alt=\"Why Choose Curbio for Renovations\" class=\"wp-image-265333\" width=\"1000\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Why-Choose-Curbio-for-Renovations.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Why-Choose-Curbio-for-Renovations-980x223.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Why-Choose-Curbio-for-Renovations-480x109.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Curbio has reimagined home improvement to more effectively serve the needs of real estate. They give agents and their clients a simple, reliable solution. By keeping a focus on efficiency and results, Curbio makes sure that every renovation goes straight to improving the home sale process.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Here&#8217;s how Curbio stands out:</p>\n<h3 id=\"clear-and-transparent-communication-throughout-the-process\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Clear and Transparent Communication Throughout the Process</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Transparency is at the core of Curbio’s philosophy. The entire renovation process is managed through their app, providing frequent updates that keep both agents and sellers fully informed at every stage. This level of communication fosters trust, ensures that everyone stays on the same page, and eliminates unnecessary stress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trusted-partner-for-real-estate-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Trusted Partner for Real Estate Agents</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">More importantly, <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/realtor-benefits-program/home-lifestyle/curbio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Curbio has proven itself</a> as a reliable solution for thousands of real estate professionals across the country. Their unique pay-at-closing model removes upfront costs, so it’s easy for sellers to make needed improvements before listing. Agents that partner with Curbio have a distinct competitive advantage, providing their clients with a proven, simple way to increase their home’s market value before selling. </p>\n<h3 id=\"reliable-and-professional-contractors\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Reliable and Professional Contractors</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Curbio’s renovation as a service model takes the complexity out of the renovation process. They take care of sourcing materials to coordinating schedules, making sure projects are moving along efficiently and professionally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-also-ask-about-curbio\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About Curbio</h2>\n<h3 id=\"is-using-curbio-required-for-e-xp-realty-agents\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is using Curbio required for eXp Realty agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. Curbio is an optional solution within eXp Realty Solutions. Agents may choose to use Curbio for certain listings, work with other renovation vendors, or list properties as-is. Participation has no impact on commission splits, caps, sponsorship, or standing with eXp Realty.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-using-curbio-required-for-e-xp-realty-agents-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does Curbio compare to hiring contractors directly?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Curbio differs by providing a fully managed, pre-listing renovation service with pay-at-close funding. Unlike hiring contractors directly, agents and sellers do not manage bids, timelines, materials, or payments, and the renovation scope is designed specifically to maximize resale value.</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-using-curbio-required-for-e-xp-realty-agents-1-1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who is Curbio best suited for?</h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Curbio is best suited for sellers who want to improve their home before listing but lack upfront cash, time, or desire to manage renovations. It is commonly used for cosmetic updates that improve marketability rather than structural or custom remodel projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty</h2>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Curbio is designed to address one of the most common listing challenges agents face, preparing homes for sale when sellers lack time, cash, or desire to manage renovations, but it does not operate in isolation or replace the broader brokerage experience.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions. What differs is the sponsor ecosystem an agent aligns with.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-980x194.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-480x95.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The sponsor is selected during the application process, before most agents have used the brokerage’s systems, explored its tools, or seen how sponsorship works in real life. Knowing where sponsorship fits within eXp Realty’s overall structure helps agents view this decision in the right context.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720537389\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Do eXp Realty agents have to use Curbio for renovations?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Curbio is completely optional. eXp Realty agents may recommend Curbio, use other renovation providers, or list homes without updates. Using or not using Curbio does not affect an agent’s brokerage relationship, compensation structure, or access to other eXp Realty solutions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720544121\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Who pays for Curbio renovations and when?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Renovation costs are paid by the seller at closing from sale proceeds. There are no upfront payments required. Interest is charged only during the renovation period, and the full balance is settled once the transaction closes.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720552196\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Does Curbio handle project management and contractors?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. Curbio manages the entire renovation process, including contractor coordination, materials, timelines, and updates. Agents and sellers do not manage subcontractors or scheduling, which allows agents to remain focused on listing preparation and marketing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720561689\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Are there limits on the types of renovations Curbio performs?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. Curbio focuses on high-impact, cosmetic updates such as paint, flooring, kitchens, bathrooms, and curb appeal. Structural changes, additions, or custom remodels are generally outside the scope of Curbio’s pre-listing renovation model.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720573166\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is Curbio available in every market?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. Curbio operates in most major U.S. markets, but availability varies by location. Agents should confirm coverage for their specific market before recommending Curbio to a seller, as service areas continue to expand over time.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"related-e-xp-realty-solutions-guides\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related eXp Realty Solutions Guides</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/offices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty Offices Exist: Here’s How They Work!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty Healthcare: Save Up to 80% on Premium Care!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/success-lending/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Success Lending eXp: eXp Realty Agents Provide Mortgage Solutions</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Meeting homeowners directly allows for genuine conversations, where both parties can engage meaningfully. This method is particularly powerful when compared to the often impersonal feel of digital communication.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When you’re physically in front of a homeowner, being able to use your body language and tone of voice can really help build that rapport. These non-verbal cues go a long way in communicating your genuine interest and breaking you out of the pack of competitors who default to email or phone.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">With limited investment, the unique and personal touch of door knocking gives you a low-cost marketing strategy that truly stands out and works.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"building-trust-with-homeowners\">Building Trust with Homeowners</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Door knocking is a great way for real estate agents to demonstrate their authenticity and trustworthiness. Providing local market knowledge and expertise helps build credibility with homeowners. By sharing personal stories, you add a layer of relatability that builds trust.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Following up on that initial talk shows that you’re trustworthy and serious, making them trust you even more. This approach is particularly important given that 80% of homebuyers want agents who have specific knowledge about the area they want to move to.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"creating-immediate-connections\">Creating Immediate Connections</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Starting conversations with open-ended questions builds rapport and allows residents to feel like they are listened to. Using active listening techniques to demonstrate authentic curiosity about their issues helps to establish a comfortable environment.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This kind of environment encourages homeowners to provide their feedback candidly, so you can receive the most insightful critiques. These kinds of insights can be applied to improve your services and target your marketing efforts, strengthening your position as the local expert even more.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Being known as a credible professional who cares for the community will garner you more word of mouth referrals and business opportunities. Door knocking success is not simply closing a deal. It’s about nurturing those budding relationships, even those with the individuals who aren’t prepared to purchase or sell today.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"preparing-for-door-knocking\">Preparing for Door Knocking</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"182\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6dd9a49fa92bb513-Preparing-for-Door-Knocking.webp/public\" alt=\"Preparing for Door Knocking\" class=\"wp-image-264821\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Preparing-for-Door-Knocking.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Preparing-for-Door-Knocking-300x55.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Preparing-for-Door-Knocking-768x140.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Addressing door knocking in real estate means being strategic. Having a thorough plan is important. You’ll need to identify strategic priority neighborhoods and even individual homes to door-knock. The more familiar you are with your territory the better.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Know your neighborhood demographics to plan your approach. Wealthy family neighborhoods may at least partially be buffered with a parent at home in the afternoon. Don’t just assume that evenings or weekends are going to be the best times. They may very well be. Instead, drive around to find FSBO signs, or look for expired listings ahead of time.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"conduct-thorough-research\">Conduct Thorough Research</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Understanding property values and trends is critical. This can help identify potential leads. Collect detailed information on comparable recent sales and nearby amenities.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Best of all, it arms you with helpful talking points once you’re door knocking with homeowners. In addition, look into events in the community. Finding mutual interests can help establish trust.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"gather-necessary-supplies\">Gather Necessary Supplies</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Put together a folder of all the things you’ll need including flyers, business cards, or door hangers. Personalized, meaningful gifts or notes can go a long way and have a lasting impact.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Have a sure-fire method for logging interactions. It helps with follow-up, too.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"dress-appropriately-and-comfortably\">Dress Appropriately and Comfortably</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Professional, comfortable clothing is a must. Showcase your brand, but be mindful of neighborhood culture. Things like a clean appearance go a long way to inspire confidence.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"set-clear-objectives\">Set Clear Objectives</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Have clear, concrete objectives for each session. Getting new leads or booking more appointments are a few.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Develop specific, measurable outcomes so you can measure success. Change goals based on what you learned.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"effective-door-knocking-strategies\">Effective Door Knocking Strategies</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"207\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5cff53e4c2df5443-Door-Knocking-in-Real-Estate-Effective-Door-Knocking-Strategies.webp/public\" alt=\"Door Knocking in Real Estate, Effective Door Knocking Strategies\" class=\"wp-image-264819\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Door-Knocking-in-Real-Estate-Effective-Door-Knocking-Strategies.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Door-Knocking-in-Real-Estate-Effective-Door-Knocking-Strategies-300x62.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Door-Knocking-in-Real-Estate-Effective-Door-Knocking-Strategies-768x159.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-plan-your-approach\">1. Plan Your Approach</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Having a door knocking game plan is key. Door knocking can sometimes feel chaotic. Begin by developing a simple, step-by-step plan for each stop. Work out the central talking points that will appeal to homeowners and outline possible pushback.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Be prepared with answers to alleviate these fears. First, plan your visits at times where you know you’ll have the best chance of finding homeowners, such as in the morning. Setting an achievable cap on how many homes you can hit in a day will save you from burning out and help you maintain your enthusiasm.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-start-with-a-friendly-greeting\">2. Start with a Friendly Greeting</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Sometimes, though, a nice smile and friendly attitude go a long way. Addressing the homeowner by name is important. Using the homeowner’s full name to introduce yourself will further increase the degree of personalization.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">If you live in the neighborhood, let them know so you can get them to feel like you’re a friend and neighbor, not a scary stranger. This friendly introduction opens the door to trust and transparency.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-understand-client-needs\">3. Understand Client Needs</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Asking the right questions is the secret sauce to learning what motivates and worries your homeowners. By carefully listening, you’ll be able to customize your pitch to address their unique needs, making the value of your service more relevant.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Invite them in, do some research, ask questions, show understanding and concern for their situation and ultimately you’ll earn their trust and win more listings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"4-develop-a-persuasive-pitch\">4. Develop a Persuasive Pitch</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Creating a short, clear, and engaging message is key. Identify your unique value proposition and employ narrative storytelling strategies to make your ask personal, timely, and relevant.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Be sure to highlight the features of your services that will best help the homeowner, clearing a path to making your offer stick out, and stand out.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"5-schedule-followup-meetings\">5. Schedule Follow-Up Meetings</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Suggest exact dates and times for future meetings to facilitate buy-in. Be courteous and professional, and include contact details so they are easily found.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This method keeps the line of communication open and makes it more likely you will convert.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"6-present-tailored-proposals\">6. Present Tailored Proposals</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Tailor your proposals accordingly to what the homeowner says they are interested in. Provide compelling data and insights to make your case, presenting them with the right solutions to help them meet their own objectives.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A well-tailored proposal demonstrates understanding and increases trust.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"7-address-concerns-confidently\">7. Address Concerns Confidently</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Recognize the objections that will come at you and prepare measured responses. Come prepared with evidence and examples to counter fears and build trust.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">If you do encounter hesitations, keeping a cool, courteous attitude will not only diffuse any worries but ensure the chat stays friendly.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"8-close-the-deal-successfully\">8. Close the Deal Successfully</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Highlight the main takeaways and remind them of the value your services can provide. In each case, help motivate homeowners to act with clear next steps.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Leave with thanks. Thank them for their time, for their consideration, and to create a friendly climate for continued engagement.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"9-ensure-postsale-followup\">9. Ensure Post-Sale Follow-Up</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Follow-up calls or visits keep the relationship strong after the sale. Handwritten thank-you notes or small tokens of appreciation can go a long way and help keep prospective homeowners abreast of market changes and new listings.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This kind of continued communication helps to cement the relationship and is likely to result in repeat business or referrals down the road.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"adapting-techniques-for-luxury-markets\">Adapting Techniques for Luxury Markets</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"199\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5070dc2525459fc8-Door-Knocking-in-Real-Estate-Adapting-Techniques-for-Luxury-Markets.webp/public\" alt=\"Door Knocking in Real Estate, Adapting Techniques for Luxury Markets\" class=\"wp-image-264818\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Door-Knocking-in-Real-Estate-Adapting-Techniques-for-Luxury-Markets.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Door-Knocking-in-Real-Estate-Adapting-Techniques-for-Luxury-Markets-300x60.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Door-Knocking-in-Real-Estate-Adapting-Techniques-for-Luxury-Markets-768x153.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"research-highend-neighborhoods\">Research High-End Neighborhoods</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">To get a read on the dynamics at play in affluent areas, begin by looking for telltale signs. Seek out gourmet restaurants, exclusive boutiques, and top-tier schools that’ll lure in luxury buyers.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Compare recent sales to identify pricing trends and changes in demand, giving insight into how homes in these neighborhoods are being valued. Knowing the local businesses and services that cater to affluent clients builds your credibility and rapport with affluent buyers.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This preparation enables brokers to provide perspectives that appeal to savvy luxury markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"build-strong-relationships\">Build Strong Relationships</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Deepening relationships with homeowners through regular communication is key. Showing up to local events helps build rapport and creates a sense of awareness of you and your business within the community.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Delivering content that luxury homeowners find valuable, such as market trends, establishes you as a trustworthy source. Building trust by showcasing market knowledge can secure multi-million-dollar listings, a strategy proven by successful agents like Ben Bacal.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"make-memorable-first-impressions\">Make Memorable First Impressions</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Having a focused and polished image is key. High-quality marketing materials reflect brand sophistication, while mindful body language and confident tones ensure professionalism.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This new approach works well for luxury clients, helping during face-to-face negotiations, especially in-person deal making, where body language often can affect the deal.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"prepare-for-potential-rejections\">Prepare for Potential Rejections</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A good attitude goes a long way towards accepting “no” with professionalism. Rehearsing answers to potential objections helps make these interactions respectful and civically-minded.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Seeing rejections as learning opportunities is a great way to refine techniques and make a stronger first impression next time.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"essential-tools-for-door-knocking\">Essential Tools for Door Knocking</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"bring-marketing-materials\">Bring Marketing Materials</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Door knocking is far more effective when equipped with the proper materials. Have a variety of promotional materials including flyers and business cards on hand. Door hangers are eye catching and help initiate conversations.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Create flashy pieces that display your identity well. Add details of your offerings and knowledge of the local market. Emphasize unique selling points.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Promote interesting aspects of the homes you’re showing, like a standout feature or the benefits of the home’s location. Think about providing virtual training sessions over platforms like Zoom so anyone can join from anywhere.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"use-effective-communication-skills\">Use Effective Communication Skills</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Good communication is the key to creating new opportunities. Follow up with active listening. Let homeowners tell you what they need.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Keeping good eye contact and an open body language will help you build rapport and connect. Adjust your approach to suit each resident. A strong script will help you open and close conversations with ease.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Invite them to meet one on one to talk about their specific needs and goals.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"offer-value-to-residents\">Offer Value to Residents</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Establish yourself as a market expert by providing local context and knowledge. Give homeowners useful resources or information, such as home maintenance tips.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Feature community happenings or undertakings that would appeal to them. Building trust this way is a good way to list high-ticket items.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Door knocking is a low-cost brand strategy that can result in multi-million-dollar contracts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"overcoming-challenges-in-door-knocking\">Overcoming Challenges in Door Knocking</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0872a224a9753105-Overcoming-Challenges-in-Door-Knocking.webp/public\" alt=\"Overcoming Challenges in Door Knocking\" class=\"wp-image-264820\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Overcoming-Challenges-in-Door-Knocking.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Overcoming-Challenges-in-Door-Knocking-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Overcoming-Challenges-in-Door-Knocking-768x151.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">In real estate, door knocking does come with a few challenges. The first hurdle is sometimes the biggest: rejection. Maybe you knock on 100 doors to get 20 good conversations. To avoid these, it’s most important to think strategically.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Tools like PropertyRadar allow Realtors to target the neighborhoods that match their buyers’ needs, making the process more efficient. PropertyRadar’s rich data on properties and owners helps you get more targeted, with the right personalized messaging to break through to qualified clients.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"handle-no-responses-gracefully\">Handle No Responses Gracefully</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When no one’s home, dropping off branded materials ensures you remain on voters’ radar. Plus, this method is more respectful of homeowners’ privacy, making sure you aren’t an unwelcome surprise.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Keeping a good attitude helps too, because every door you don’t get an answer at is an opportunity to work on getting a better answer the next time.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"address-objections-effectively\">Address Objections Effectively</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">If you can anticipate their objections, you’ll be able to prepare some thoughtful responses. Using data and testimonials to demonstrate that your program works goes a long way toward assuaging concerns.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Even if a door knocking conversation is unexpectedly difficult, staying cool shows that you are professional and worthy of trust.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"avoid-closing-on-doorstep\">Avoid Closing on Doorstep</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Build rapport, not a sale. First impressions matter. Plan follow-ups to build bridges and strengthen ties.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This leaves the door open for future interactions, providing a non-pressured way to reconnect.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"best-practices-for-successful-visits\">Best Practices for Successful Visits</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Developing a schedule that blends door knocking with all your marketing activities is a recipe for success. This involves planning your visits for optimal times, such as weekdays between 8 a.m. 11:30 a.m., when people are more likely to be at home.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">There’s no substitute for a strong first impression, and a well-prepared script can ensure you provide vital information in a clear, concise manner. With a good response rate of 20%, timing and approach make all the difference.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"limit-daily-door-knocks\">Limit Daily Door Knocks</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By making a daily target of around 20 homes, advocates can have productive conversations without experiencing volunteer burnout. This simple number allows you to have real conversations, which are always better than an in-and-out visit.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Being mindful of your energy levels will help you stay excited and make every visit worthwhile.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"monitor-your-progress-regularly\">Monitor Your Progress Regularly</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Documenting your meetings allows you to measure impact. Monitoring what’s successful and what isn’t allows you to hone your strategy year after year.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Continuous improvement means celebrating small successes, which keeps motivation high and goals always in sight.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"implement-safety-measures\">Implement Safety Measures</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Safety must always come first. Let a trusted friend know where you’ll be, bring a fully charged phone, and use your judgment on what areas of the neighborhood are safe to be in.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Don’t venture into places that make you feel unsafe, for your own safety and peace of mind.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"enhancing-engagement-with-residents\">Enhancing Engagement with Residents</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Door knocking in real estate is an art that calls for smooth, relatable, and personable engagement. One of the most effective tactics is to pose provocative questions. I like to design open-ended questions, like having homeowners tell me what it’s been like to live in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This creates a safe space for them to share more personal insights while allowing me to better comprehend their needs. Discussing topics like their home’s unique features, neighborhood changes, or future plans often leads to meaningful conversations. These conversations shape the experience and build trust.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Offering sincere praise is another good strategy. One of my favorite things about a homeowners property is an expansive beautiful garden or a large covered porch. This fosters an inviting, friendly environment.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This level of detail conveys respect and appreciation, establishing a strong bond. Inviting new homeowners to community events is a great way to build connections. Providing a calendar of local events they could participate in is a great way to generate that initial interest and encourage further engagement.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These invitations are a great way to showcase the benefits of community engagement, further building the neighborhood’s sense of community spirit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Door knocking in real estate is all about face-to-face interactions.

First, it&#8217;s essential to understand the different types of commission structures and how the math plays out for each one.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-split-types\">Commission Split Types</h3>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fixed-percentage-splits\">Fixed Percentage Splits</h4>\n<p>This is the most straightforward model. The commission is split based on a fixed percentage agreed upon with your brokerage. Common splits include 50/50, 60/40 or 70/30.  We’ll break down exactly what that means in the next section.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"graduated-splits\">Graduated Splits</h4>\n<p>Graduated splits adjust based on your performance or graduation from brand new agent status. For example:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You might start at a 50/50 split as a new agent.</li>\n<li>After hitting certain sales targets or gaining experience, your split could improve to 60/40 or even higher.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cap-system\">Cap System</h4>\n<p>In the cap system, you contribute a percentage of your commissions to the brokerage until you reach a predetermined cap. After hitting this cap, you keep 100% of your commissions for the rest of the year. This can be a significant advantage for high-producing agents.</p>\n<p>For instance, if a brokerage sets a cap at $16,000, once you&#8217;ve paid this amount, all subsequent commissions are yours to keep each year, maximizing your earnings.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"100percent-commission-plan\">100% Commission Plan</h4>\n<p>With a 100% commission plan, you don’t split your commission with the brokerage. Instead, you pay a flat fee per transaction or monthly office fees.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"royalty-fees\">Royalty Fees</h4>\n<p>While not a commission split, royalty fees are an important factor to consider. All brokerages charge some type of administrative fees, but royalty fees are often higher and can&#8217;t be ignored. These fees can eat into your earnings, so it&#8217;s crucial to factor them in when comparing different brokerages.</p>\n<p>For example, if your split is 70/30 with your broker and there’s a 6% royalty fee, the “real split” for you is 64/36. We&#8217;ll cover brokerage fees in more detail later, but for now, we&#8217;ll include royalty fees in the commission split discussion.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-math\">Commission Math</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/035f98539f12d5e7-Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-Commission-Math.webp/public\" alt=\"Best Real Estate Companies to Work For, Commission Math\" class=\"wp-image-264359\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-Commission-Math.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-Commission-Math-300x53.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-Commission-Math-768x136.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;re familiar with the types of commission splits, let&#8217;s get into how the commission splits are calculated. This math applies to the vast majority of brokerages.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"total-commission-calculation\">Total Commission Calculation</h3>\n<p>An agent&#8217;s commission is typically a percentage of the sale price, as specified in the listing or buyer agent agreement. This percentage can vary widely, usually ranging from 1.5% to 3.5% for each agent involved—the seller&#8217;s agent and the buyer&#8217;s agent.  Here&#8217;s a straightforward example:</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example:</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Home Sale Price: $1,000,000</li>\n<li>Listing or Buyer Agent Agreement Fee: 3%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Agent Commission Calculation:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agent Commission = Sale Price x Commission Rate</li>\n<li>Agent Commission = $1,000,000 x 3% = $30,000</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"splitting-agent-commission-with-your-brokerage\">Splitting Agent Commission with Your Brokerage</h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve earned the commission, the next step is splitting it with your brokerage based on your contract terms. Here&#8217;s how it breaks down:</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example:</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agent’s Share: 80%</li>\n<li>Brokerage’s Share: 20%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Step 1: Calculate Agent Earnings:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agent’s Earnings = Total Commission x Agent’s Share</li>\n<li>Agent’s Earnings = $30,000 x 80% = $24,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Step 2: Calculate Brokerage Earnings:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Brokerage’s Earnings = Total Commission x Brokerage’s Share</li>\n<li>Brokerage’s Earnings = $30,000 x 20% = $6,000</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"splitting-agent-commission-with-your-team\">Splitting Agent Commission with Your Team</h3>\n<p>Not all agents are part of a team, but many, especially new agents, prefer to start their careers within a team structure. Teams typically charge a percentage of an agent’s earnings in exchange for value-added services like leads, guidance, resources, and tools. Here&#8217;s how you calculate your net earnings after splitting with your team:</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example:</h4>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agent’s Earnings: $24,000 (after brokerage split)</li>\n<li>Team’s Share: 25%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Calculate Agent’s Net After Team Split:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agent’s Net Earnings = Agent’s Earnings &#8211; Team’s Share</li>\n<li>Agent’s Net Earnings = $24,000 x 75% = $18,000</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"research-challenges\">Research Challenges</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"201\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e266cc756b8e0947-Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-Research-Challenges.webp/public\" alt=\"Best Real Estate Companies to Work For, Research Challenges\" class=\"wp-image-264362\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-Research-Challenges.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-Research-Challenges-300x60.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-Research-Challenges-768x154.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>Before we dive into the list of brokerages and their typical commission splits, there are a few things we need to clear up.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"caveat-1-traditional-brokerage-model-splits-often-vary-by-office\">Caveat 1: Traditional Brokerage Model Splits Often Vary by Office</h3>\n<p>Yep, you read that right! It&#8217;s nearly impossible to quote an exact commission split for traditional brokerages. These are your classic franchise, brick-and-mortar offices. And yes, that’s most brokerages out there!</p>\n<p>Why is it so tricky? Well, each franchise office is owned and operated by different broker owners who are free to set whatever commission splits they want. So, you can’t just look up the commission split on the internet for a particular traditional brokerage.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"caveat-2-traditional-brokerage-model-splits-often-vary-by-agent\">Caveat 2: Traditional Brokerage Model Splits Often Vary by Agent</h3>\n<p>To make things even more complicated, different agents within the same traditional brokerage likely have different commission splits. These variations are based on factors like agent experience, success, or even their potential for success. And guess what? The criteria for these splits are usually known only to the broker owner. So, again, no easy internet lookup here.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"caveat-resolution-solving-the-traditional-brokerage-model-problem\">Caveat Resolution: Solving the Traditional Brokerage Model Problem</h3>\n<p>Given the non-transparent nature of traditional brokerage models, we&#8217;ve done a ton of research and conducted interviews to come up with a range of what most traditional brokerages seem to offer their agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cloudbased-brokerage-model-commission-splits\">Cloud-Based Brokerage Model Commission Splits</h3>\n<p>But hey, there&#8217;s some even better news! When it comes to cloud-based brokerages, commission split information is often transparent—you can actually look it up online. Cloud-based models don’t sell franchise offices and typically don’t have physical offices. This setup means lower expenses, no franchise bloat, and no duplicated staff across offices, allowing them to offer higher commission splits than traditional models.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-real-estate-companies-to-work-for\">Best Real Estate Companies to Work For</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/23278a57b85255ab-Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For.webp/public\" alt=\"Best Real Estate Companies to Work For\" class=\"wp-image-264363\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-300x56.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Best-Real-Estate-Companies-to-Work-For-768x142.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p>Alright, let’s get down to business with our commission split comparison.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll present the information starting from the lowest commission split ranges for agents to the best commission splits.</p>\n<p>And, fyi, we’ve skipped the lowest possible commission splits &#8211; those that are for brand new agents. Why? Because those don’t affect all agents and they’re temporary.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, here are the commission splits that most agents at these large established brokerages earn.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"redfin-3070--7525\">Redfin: 30/70 &#8211; 75/25</h3>\n<p>Redfin is a discount brokerage that charges lower fees to clients and pays lower splits to agents. However, the trade-off is that Redfin agents are salaried and can gain their own clients to reach the higher end of the split.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"corcoran-5050--7030\">Corcoran: 50/50 &#8211; 70/30</h3>\n<p>A traditional brokerage with a 6% royalty fee. The splits here are fairly standard, but keep in mind that royalty fee will take a bite out of your earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"douglas-elliman-5050--7030\">Douglas Elliman: 50/50 &#8211; 70/30</h3>\n<p>Another traditional brokerage, also with a 6% royalty fee. Similar to Corcoran, your splits will depend on your experience and success, but that royalty fee is something to consider.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"coldwell-banker-5545--9010\">Coldwell Banker: 55/45 &#8211; 90/10</h3>\n<p>A well-known traditional brokerage with royalty fees ranging from 5% to 6.5%. They offer higher potential splits, especially for experienced agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"berkshire-hathaway-6040--9010\">Berkshire Hathaway: 60/40 &#8211; 90/10</h3>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway operates under a traditional model with a 6% royalty fee. They provide competitive splits that can go up to 90/10 for top-performing agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"better-homes--gardens-6040--8020\">Better Homes &#038; Gardens: 60/40 &#8211; 80/20</h3>\n<p>This traditional brokerage charges a 6% royalty fee. Their splits are solid, offering a good balance for most agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"compass-6040--92575\">Compass: 60/40 &#8211; 92.5/7.5</h3>\n<p>A traditional hybrid brokerage with a lower 4% fee. Again, top performers earn the higher split less the 4% fee.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-agency-7030--9010\">The Agency: 70/30 &#8211; 90/10</h3>\n<p>Operating under a traditional model with a 6% royalty fee, The Agency has been expanding a lot lately.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sothebys-7030--9010\">Sotheby&#8217;s: 70/30 &#8211; 90/10</h3>\n<p>Another traditional brokerage with a 6% royalty fee. Sotheby’s is a good choice for experienced agents looking for a prestigious brand.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"remax-6040--955\">RE/MAX: 60/40 &#8211; 95/5</h3>\n<p>RE/MAX is a traditional brokerage with a 5% royalty fee. They have some of the best splits in the business, potentially going up to 95/5.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"century-21-7030--928\">Century 21: 70/30 &#8211; 92/8</h3>\n<p>This traditional brokerage has a cap of about $22.5K and charges an 8% fee. They offer good splits and a cap that can benefit high earners.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"keller-williams-7030--1000\">Keller Williams: 70/30 &#8211; 100/0</h3>\n<p>Keller Williams, a traditional brokerage with a cap of $21-30K, charges a 6% royalty fee until the cap is reached.

Common splits include 50/50, 60/40 or 70/30.  Graduated splits adjust based on your performance or graduation from brand new agent status. Cap System &#8211; here you contribute a percentage of your commissions to the brokerage until you reach a predetermined cap. After hitting this cap, you keep 100% of your commissions for the rest of the year. 100% Commission Plan &#8211; here you don’t split your commission with the brokerage. Instead, you pay a flat fee per transaction or monthly office fees.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-are-real-estate-broker-royalty-fees\">What are real estate broker royalty fees?</h3>\n<p>Royalty fees are paid by agents who work at brokerages that are a franchise business. These fees can eat into your earnings, so it&#8217;s crucial to factor them in when comparing different brokerages. For example, if your split is 70/30 with your broker and there’s a 6% royalty fee, the “real split” for you is 64/36.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-i-calculate-my-real-estate-commission\">How do I calculate my real estate commission?</h3>\n<p>An agent&#8217;s commission is typically a percentage of the sale price, as specified in the listing or buyer agent agreement. Example: Home Sale Price: $1,000,000, Listing or Buyer Agent Agreement Fee: 3%, agent commission = $1,000,000 x 3% = $30,000. Next, the agent must split their commission with their brokerage. Example, in a 80/20 split, agent’s earnings = $30,000 x 80% = $24,000 and brokerage’s earnings = $30,000 x 20% = $6,000</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-an-agent-pay-for-their-team\">How does an agent pay for their team?</h3>\n<p>Not all agents are part of a team, but many, especially new agents, prefer to start their careers within a team structure. Teams typically charge a percentage of an agent’s earnings in exchange for value-added services like leads, guidance, resources, and tools. Example: agent’s earnings: $24,000 (after brokerage split), Team’s Share: 25%. Agent’s Net Earnings = $24,000 x 75% = $18,000</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-else-does-a-real-estate-agent-pay-for-besides-brokerage-and-team-splits\">What else does a real estate agent pay for besides brokerage and team splits?</h3>\n<p>They pay nearly all costs of doing business like license and association annual fees, marketing costs, support staff like editors and transaction coordinators, car expenses, office needs, all listing expenses and much more.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-cant-i-easily-find-out-a-brokerages-commission-split\">Why can’t I easily find out a brokerage’s commission split?</h3>\n<p>Traditional brokerages with franchises are owned and operated by different broker owners who are free to set whatever commission splits they want. To make things even more complicated, different agents within the same traditional brokerage likely have different commission splits too. Factors like agent experience, success, or even their potential for success lead the broker owner to offer different splits.</p>\n",

It does not change commission splits, but it converts production performance into ownership, making it a central component of how long-term income and wealth building work at eXp Realty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tl-dr-about-e-xp-icon-agent-status\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR About eXp ICON Agent Status</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>ICON status is a production-based recognition program at eXp Realty</li>\n<li>Qualifying agents earn their annual cap back in company stock</li>\n<li>ICON does not change commission splits or caps</li>\n<li>Stock awards are tied to production, culture, and event participation</li>\n<li>ICON status converts expenses into ownership rather than cash bonuses</li>\n<li>Participation is based on annual performance</li>\n<li>ICON is part of the broader eXp Realty income model, not a standalone program</li>\n</ul>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\"/>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">High-producing agents eventually reach a point where commission splits matter less than what happens after they cap. At eXp Realty, ICON Agent status is designed to reward sustained production by converting brokerage expenses into company ownership rather than recurring costs. This distinction is often misunderstood, especially by agents comparing brokerages only on headline splits.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">ICON status does not replace commission income and it does not function as a bonus program. Instead, it sits within eXp Realty’s broader income structure, alongside capped commissions and stock awards, as a mechanism for long-term value creation.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">This article explains how eXp ICON Agent status fits into the broader <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/income/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty income ecosystem</a> available to eXp agents.

In short, they’re recognized for providing an extraordinary level of productivity and service to the eXp Realty community.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Only agents who achieve certain thresholds are eligible to earn this prestigious award. It represents the highest level of achievement and is in complete harmony with eXp Realty’s core values. These agents are part of the elite, top 1% of agents across the world.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">They are excited about eXp Realty because they can not only get stock awards, but they get to recover their $16,000 cap in the form of EXPI stock. Naturally, the ICON Agent Award has become a favorite since it was created in 2015, and for good reason.</p>\n<h3 id=\"role-and-responsibilities\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Role and Responsibilities</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">The role of an eXp ICON Agent goes far beyond selling. These elite agents give back by mentoring their peers, creating a culture of encouragement, dedication, and support that propels everyone forward.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">They maintain an extraordinary level of ethics, and professionalism shines through on every deal. eXp ICON agents have a direct impact on eXp Realty’s culture through their involvement in initiatives and events.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">This deeper level of engagement benefits both the community and helps to build stronger leadership within the organization. The benefits further attract top talent, solidifying eXp Realty&#8217;s global reputation as a leader in real estate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"qualification-steps-to-achieve-exp-icon-agent-status\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Qualification Steps to Achieve eXp ICON Agent Status</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/eeb49f3b7f923619-Qualification-Steps-to-Achieve-eXp-ICON-Agent-Status.webp/public\" alt=\"Qualification Steps to Achieve eXp ICON Agent Status\" class=\"wp-image-263286\" width=\"1000\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Qualification-Steps-to-Achieve-eXp-ICON-Agent-Status.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Qualification-Steps-to-Achieve-eXp-ICON-Agent-Status-980x190.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Qualification-Steps-to-Achieve-eXp-ICON-Agent-Status-480x93.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Meet production targets.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Engage in cultural commitment.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Participate in events.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"1-meet-production-targets\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">1. Meet Production Targets</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Agents can become ICON by meeting one of the following options after they have capped in a particular year:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Do another 20 transactions thereby paying $5000 in capped status transaction fees or</li>\n<li>Do at least $500,000 Gross Commission Income (GCI) with a minimum of 10 closed transactions + payment of the ICON qualifying fee. ($5000 paid in capped status transaction fees or cash).</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Upon meeting these production requirements, agents earn $8000 paid in EXPI stock with a 3 year vesting period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-engage-in-cultural-commitment\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">2. Engage in Cultural Commitment</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">It deepens the eXp Realty culture and builds camaraderie among agents. By participating in community improvement efforts in various “give back opportunties, agents earn $4000 in company stock.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Engaging in <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/mentorship/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mentorship programs</a> or teaching in <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/exp-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp World</a> university events are two ways an agent can demonstrate alignment with a company’s desired culture.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">This devotion creates new opportunities and fosters trust in the network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-participate-in-events\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">3. Participate in Events</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Going to eXp Realty approved events is a requirement for ICON. These events are dense with opportunities for cultural engagement and networking.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether it’s an <a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/events/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">annual conference, regional meet-up</a>, ICON agents earn up to $4000 in EXPI by attending two such events.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Through active engagement, agents will increase their circle of influence and expertise, while connecting with like-minded agents, giving them a competitive advantage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"strategies-for-reaching-exp-icon-agent-status-quickly\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Common Practices Used by Agents Working Toward ICON Status</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/08d6aab47cd03b4e-Strategies-for-Reaching-eXp-ICON-Agent-Status-Quickly.webp/public\" alt=\"Strategies for Reaching eXp ICON Agent Status Quickly\" class=\"wp-image-263287\" width=\"1000\" height=\"229\" srcset=\"https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Strategies-for-Reaching-eXp-ICON-Agent-Status-Quickly.webp 1000w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Strategies-for-Reaching-eXp-ICON-Agent-Status-Quickly-980x224.webp 980w, https://smartagentalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Strategies-for-Reaching-eXp-ICON-Agent-Status-Quickly-480x110.webp 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1000px, 100vw\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s a bullet list of strategies agents can implement to expedite their path to this prestigious status:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Optimize sales techniques.</li>\n<li>Focus on client relationships.</li>\n<li>Leverage mentorship opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"optimize-sales-techniques\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Optimize Sales Techniques</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Personally, I think there’s a lot of untapped potential in improving the effectiveness of sales techniques to increase productivity and close rates. Implementing technology tools to automate sales processes and enhance client experiences is a secret sauce.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">By committing to continuous learning and staying attuned to market trends, agents can keep themselves competitive and relevant. Using a CRM system allows for more efficient tracking and management of important client information.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, digital learning options help you keep your skills honed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"focus-on-client-relationships\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Focus on Client Relationships</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Healthy vendor client relationships are critical for building repeat business and earning referrals. By making customer service and customer satisfaction priorities across your firm, you’ll earn impressive client experiences, which will convert into more sales and in turn, larger commissions.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">By figuring out ways to customize their services, agents can meet their clients’ needs while keeping communication open and consistent via follow-up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leverage-mentorship-opportunities\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Leverage Mentorship Opportunities</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Guidance from seasoned ICON agents offers priceless knowledge and accelerates career development. Getting involved in these mentorship programs at eXp Realty can unlock you to learning new strategies and perspectives.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">This guidance assists newer agents in overcoming obstacles and establishing successful business practices more quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-the-exp-icon-agent-stock-awards\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Understanding the eXp ICON Agent Stock Awards</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">Stock awards are an important part of the ICON Agent honor within eXp Realty. They’re an important part of the overall compensation, serving as a signal of the company’s long-term intention to reward top-producing agents.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">These awards reward agents, not only with upfront acknowledgement, but with an equity position in the company’s growth. By aligning their interests with that of eXp Realty, agents are incentivized to help achieve long-term success.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">ICON agents can be awarded up to $16,000 in eXp World Holdings common stock. This is made up of an $8,000 Production Award, a $4,000 Cultural Commitment Award, and two $2,000 Event Attendance Awards.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vesting-and-restrictions\" class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\">Vesting and Restrictions</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">The vesting schedule for ICON stock awards requires agents to understand the timeline and any restrictions on sale or transfer. Agents are restricted from selling their ICON stock for a vesting period of at least 3 years.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">By not immediately cashing out, agents can share in the upside that comes from growth. By taking this approach, ICON is rewarding loyalty and incentivizing agents to keep their skin in the game and success of the company.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-agents-also-ask-about-e-xp-icon-agent-status\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Agents Also Ask About eXp ICON Agent Status</h2>\n<h3 id=\"is-e-xp-icon-status-required-to-earn-100-commission\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is eXp ICON status required to earn 100% commission?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">No. Agents earn 100 percent commission after reaching their annual cap regardless of ICON status. ICON is a separate recognition program that reimburses the cap in stock. Agents can earn full commission post-cap without qualifying for ICON.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-icon-status-compare-to-bonuses-at-other-brokerages\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does ICON status compare to bonuses at other brokerages?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike cash bonuses or temporary split increases, ICON status converts production performance into company stock. This means rewards are tied to ownership rather than short-term payouts, which changes how income behaves over time compared to traditional brokerage incentive programs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-is-icon-status-best-suited-for\" class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who is ICON status best suited for?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ICON status is best suited for agents with consistent transaction volume who regularly reach their annual cap. It is less relevant for low-volume agents and more applicable to producers who want to turn brokerage expenses into long-term equity rather than recurring costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters Before You Join eXp Realty&nbsp;</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left wp-block-paragraph\">eXp ICON Agent status is designed to reward top production by converting brokerage costs into ownership, but it does not operate in isolation or replace the broader eXp Realty income structure.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At eXp Realty, all agents receive the same core brokerage platform, including compliance, compensation, and access to company divisions.

ICON status recognizes sustained performance and reimburses the agent’s annual cap in company stock, converting brokerage expenses into long-term ownership rather than cash bonuses.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720368207\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What are the requirements to qualify for eXp ICON status?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Agents must first cap and then meet additional production thresholds, either through transaction count or gross commission income, along with cultural participation and approved event attendance. Exact requirements are set by eXp Realty and are reviewed annually to ensure consistent performance standards.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720373664\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Does ICON status change commission splits or caps?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>No. ICON status does not alter commission splits or caps. Agents still operate on the standard commission structure. ICON functions as a reimbursement mechanism that returns the annual cap in company stock, rather than modifying how commissions are earned on transactions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720379993\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">How are eXp ICON stock awards structured?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>ICON stock awards are issued in multiple components tied to production, cultural contribution, and event attendance. The combined total can equal the agent’s annual cap. Stock is subject to vesting requirements and cannot be immediately sold or transferred.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720386984\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Is ICON stock awarded as cash or equity?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>ICON rewards are issued as company stock, not cash. This structure aligns agent performance with company growth and is designed to support long-term wealth building rather than short-term income replacement.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1752720398897\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">Can agents earn stock awards without achieving ICON status?</h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n<p>Yes. Agents can earn stock awards through other production milestones, such as first transaction and capping awards. ICON status is a separate, higher-level recognition that reimburses the cap but does not replace other stock programs.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"related-e-xp-realty-income-guides\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Related eXp Realty Income Guides</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"/blog/about-exp-realty/stock-awards/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp Realty Stock Awards: How Agents Earn Ownership with EXPI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/beyond-commissions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beyond Commissions: How Realtors Build Real Wealth</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/exp-realty-sponsor/hidden-costs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hidden Costs of Staying at Your Brokerage as a Top Producer</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

With no steady paycheck, no client base, and no roadmap, many new agents struggle to stay focused and land their first deal.

Understand the Real Estate Landscape</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Whether you want to be a commercial property manager, residential realtor, or work in industrial real estate, diving into the industry requires exploration. Each field presents a special area of possibility.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Residential real estate is about people’s homes, their apartments, the neighborhoods they live in, and the communities they are connected to. Commercial real estate includes office buildings and shopping centers, serving the needs of the business and investor class.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Industrial real estate includes properties like warehouses and factories that cater to logistics and manufacturing operations. Knowing what these differences are allows you to better determine which one would be more profitable for you.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">For example, residential real estate usually offers stable demand because people will always need housing. Commercial and industrial properties can provide much higher returns but have their own set of challenges.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Understanding existing market conditions is key to identifying opportunities and preempting challenges before they arrive. Learning industry terms like &#8220;escrow&#8221; or &#8220;closing costs&#8221; enhances communication with clients and peers, ensuring you sound credible and knowledgeable.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"226\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/77ea0fdd2556cf17-Starting-in-Real-Estate-Starting-a-Real-Estate-Career.webp/public\" alt=\"Starting in Real Estate, Starting a Real Estate Career\" class=\"wp-image-263282\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Starting-a-Real-Estate-Career.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Starting-a-Real-Estate-Career-300x68.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Starting-a-Real-Estate-Career-768x174.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-choose-your-market-focus\">2. Choose Your Market Focus</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">First, you need to consider local market demand when deciding what property types to invest in. A busy metropolitan area is the perfect recipe for a booming rental market.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">There has always been tremendous suburban demand for family homes. You can diversify by specializing in niches such as luxury homes or rental properties to make yourself stand out.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Through competitor research, you’ll be able to find gaps in the market. Why are there so few agents serving first-time buyers or investors? Addressing these gaps can put you ahead of the competition.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By defining your target audience, you can market to them more strategically. Whether you’re looking to attract young professionals or retirees, knowing what they’re looking for helps you create the most effective messages.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-draft-a-comprehensive-business-plan\">3. Draft a Comprehensive Business Plan</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Whatever your goals are, a solid business plan is your roadmap to success. Begin with a mission and vision statement to be sure you know the outcomes you’re hoping for.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Learning the market in-depth will help you know who your clients will be and who your competitors are. Incorporate online channels into your marketing strategy, such as social media platforms and search engines.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Don’t forget to include offline tactics as well, like open houses and community events. What’s equally important is a comprehensive financial plan.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Account for factors such as initial startup costs, projected revenue, and where the funding will come from. This framework gives you a financial blueprint and roadmap that guides your investments and smart growth.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"4-obtain-required-licenses-and-certifications\">4. Obtain Required Licenses and Certifications</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">First, you’ll need to take a pre-licensing education course, which can easily set you back $350. This course of study lays the groundwork for your real estate licensing exam, the first major hurdle in proving you have the knowledge to succeed.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Once you pass the exam, you’ll need to submit your license application, usually accompanied by a background check, to the appropriate state licensing authority. Keeping current with continuing education requirements is incredibly important to not only keep your license but to keep you informed about changes in the industry.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"5-join-a-real-estate-brokerage\">5. Join a Real Estate Brokerage</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">One of the most important decisions you will make as a new agent is what brokerage to join. Do your homework on different brokerages to find one that matches your long-term goals.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Look at the level of ongoing support and resources they provide, like access to in-house training programs and marketing tools. Look at the commission splits and fees.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These will dictate how much money you will actually make. Developing an open and honest relationship with your supervising broker will set you up for successful mentorship and guidance.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Brokerages typically have a wealth of experienced agents who can help advise you and guide you as you grow.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"building-a-professional-network\">Building a Professional Network</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/be4b1f86225e49c3-Starting-in-Real-Estate-Building-a-Professional-Network.webp/public\" alt=\"Starting in Real Estate, Building a Professional Network\" class=\"wp-image-263278\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Building-a-Professional-Network.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Building-a-Professional-Network-300x61.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Building-a-Professional-Network-768x155.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Developing a professional network is an essential part of being a successful real estate agent. It opens doors to new business opportunities, referrals, and partnerships. Building and maintaining a strong network is critical. Investing in relationships with other real estate professionals is important.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Working together with mortgage brokers, appraisers, and inspectors can help build a strong referral network. When you get involved with your local real estate investing group or association, you connect with other like-minded professionals and widen your network. Scheduling informational interviews with seasoned agents provides perspective and advice that can save you time and headaches.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By getting involved with community events, you raise your visibility and establish important connections. Collaborating with industry associations can help you widen your network and build credibility. By having conversations with your machines and attending local real estate association meetings, you’ll be better connected with potential clients and partners.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">If you make it a habit to attend industry events and conferences, you’ll find even more networking opportunities. Having an elevator pitch will help make sure you put your best foot forward at these events. Regularly following up with your new contacts helps develop these relationships to continue providing you with insight into changing market trends and the latest opportunities.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Digital communities, such as LinkedIn, are an incredible tool to display your work, not only to potential employers but to mentors and industry leaders. Participating in online real estate forums and communities is a great way to interact with colleagues. Posting useful content on social media draws in potential clients and helps build your professional brand.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Using those networking events to soak up new ideas, better market trends and best practices will make you more successful.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"developing-a-strong-brand-identity\">Developing a Strong Brand Identity</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"173\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/90d9959ac51d703d-Starting-in-Real-Estate-Developing-a-Strong-Brand-Identity.webp/public\" alt=\"Starting in Real Estate, Developing a Strong Brand Identity\" class=\"wp-image-263280\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Developing-a-Strong-Brand-Identity.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Developing-a-Strong-Brand-Identity-300x52.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Developing-a-Strong-Brand-Identity-768x133.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Developing a strong brand identity in real estate is key to enduring success. It takes a keen understanding of how to communicate your brand identity, making sure that your values and mission connect with your ideal audience. This initial step is an incredibly important one.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">It defines how customers perceive your company and establishes confidence and authority. A well-developed branding strategy will help you define and express your business’s unique personality, allowing you to shine amidst a sea of competitors. Visible branding on all marketing materials, from websites to business cards, creates strong name recognition.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"create-a-memorable-business-name\">Create a Memorable Business Name</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Selecting a business name that makes an impact starts with coming up with ideas that reflect what you do and the area you serve. Most importantly, it should be memorable and pronounceable, helping clients recall your name at the time they need it most.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Register your domain name to establish a trustworthy online identity. After that, validate the name with future customers to ensure it garners a favorable response.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"design-a-distinctive-logo\">Design a Distinctive Logo</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A quality logo, developed with the help of an experienced graphic designer, will go a long way to establishing your brand visually. It needs to fit the personality of your brand and the values of your company, incorporating colors and typography that engage your ideal audience.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Building this logo into every marketing piece helps create brand uniformity, which is key to developing brand recognition.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"formulate-your-unique-selling-proposition\">Formulate Your Unique Selling Proposition</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Determining what makes you different from other real estate agents is the first step. Highlight what sets you apart in skills, experience, or services uniquely advantageous to your clients and clearly market this value proposition in all marketing initiatives.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Utilizing testimonials and case studies to make your selling points can help drive the point home, demonstrating the ways you uniquely serve and treat your clients.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"crafting-an-effective-marketing-strategy\">Crafting an Effective Marketing Strategy</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"203\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a2d9b45c30aff8a0-Starting-in-Real-Estate-Crafting-an-Effective-Marketing-Strategy.webp/public\" alt=\"Starting in Real Estate, Crafting an Effective Marketing Strategy\" class=\"wp-image-263279\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Crafting-an-Effective-Marketing-Strategy.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Crafting-an-Effective-Marketing-Strategy-300x61.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Crafting-an-Effective-Marketing-Strategy-768x156.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Understanding your niche is the first step in developing the ideal marketing strategy for your real estate business. Know who would rent or buy your properties, then create a strategic plan to target them through multiple channels.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This plan needs to identify specific, measurable goals in order to provide benchmarks to understand how well you’re doing. Strike the right balance with your budget between digital and traditional marketing and leverage performance analytics to continuously improve your tactics.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"establish-an-online-presence\">Establish an Online Presence</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">A polished website is your virtual front door, letting prospective clients browse your offerings and listings. Optimize for search engines to increase your content’s visibility, and make it mobile-friendly, which can help improve your search rankings and visitor experience.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Feature an active blog to showcase your expertise and attract prospective clients.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"utilize-social-media-channels\">Utilize Social Media Channels</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Given that there are 4.7 billion social media users worldwide, that’s where your audience is. Select social media channels that align with where your audience is, post visually interesting and dynamic content, and engage with your audience.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Use paid ads to supplement organic reach and enhance credibility.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"invest-in-quality-visual-content\">Invest in Quality Visual Content</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Hire expert photographers to get high-quality images of your property. Develop virtual tours and promotional videos, which have become must-haves for marketing properties.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Infographics are a great way to display complex market data in a digestible way, while still matching your overall brand aesthetic.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"implement-email-marketing-campaigns\">Implement Email Marketing Campaigns</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Create an email outreach list. Provide educational newsletters and use list segmentation to send more targeted and relevant messages.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Track key performance indicators to continue improving strategy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"financial-management-in-real-estate\">Financial Management in Real Estate</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Identifying and managing the financial side of real estate means having a sharp eye focused on expenses as well as revenues. To start, understand costs that are typical such as licensing fees and marketing costs. These costs can really add up, hurting your bottom line.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Then, figure out expected revenues from new commissions and new sales. Remember that the market is volatile, and the worst scenario is a major market shift that leaves you holding the bag financially. Planning for taxes and other obligations is key to not being caught off guard.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"manage-expenses-wisely\">Manage Expenses Wisely</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Tracking all company expenditures is key to managing expenses. This allows the county to find savings opportunities. Focus on the most productive spending that has a direct impact on growth.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Accounting software helps to mitigate that risk by greatly automating and simplifying this process. Continually evaluate your budget and make the changes necessary to protect your financial future.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"plan-for-longterm-financial-growth\">Plan for Long-term Financial Growth</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Identifying your financial goals helps to steer your business in the right direction. Investing in a variety of different types of opportunities can help spread and diversify income.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Putting profits back into marketing and professional development fuels the cycle of success. Keep a pulse on what’s happening in the industry so you can pivot your strategy in the right direction.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"providing-outstanding-customer-service\">Providing Outstanding Customer Service</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"235\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/dea7c09324a608fc-Starting-in-Real-Estate-Providing-Outstanding-Customer-Service.webp/public\" alt=\"Starting in Real Estate, Providing Outstanding Customer Service\" class=\"wp-image-263281\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Providing-Outstanding-Customer-Service.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Providing-Outstanding-Customer-Service-300x71.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Starting-in-Real-Estate-Providing-Outstanding-Customer-Service-768x180.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">An unwavering commitment to client satisfaction earns loyalty and leads to referrals. Think big, start small. Make a customer service policy that’s a promise to your clients to make them feel like they matter and they’re heard.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Training yourself and your staff in best practices for communication is crucial. Keep in mind that communication is a two-way street, and being present as a listener helps clients know that you’re truly committed to their journey.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By consistently asking for client feedback, you’ll be able to hone and improve your services to better suit the needs of your clients.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"build-trust-with-clients\">Build Trust with Clients</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Being transparent and honest in all interactions, whether in-person or online, will help build credibility. Delivering on what you promise makes you trustworthy, and publishing case studies and testimonials makes you even more credible.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Professionalism in every communication and transaction should be the standard. With just 11% of consumers fully trusting real estate agents, repeat behavior can go a long way in building your credibility.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"respond-promptly-to-inquiries\">Respond Promptly to Inquiries</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Having a standard response time for new inquiries is essential—potential clients don’t like waiting around for hours or days. Automated responses are a great way to acknowledge the first point of contact, but when it comes to follow-up communications, that’s your time to dazzle.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Continuously update clients with information at every stage of the buying or selling process, and set weekly meetings to keep the lines of communication open.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"offer-personalized-services\">Offer Personalized Services</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Customizing your approach to address each client’s specific needs is the key. Deliver personalized property suggestions tailored to their interests.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Things such as home staging or a comparative market analysis go a long way.

With ever-changing industry standards and regulations, it is critical to stay in tune with the field. The best way to stay on top of this topic is to subscribe to relevant industry publications and newsletters.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Webinars and conferences offer firsthand knowledge from experienced professionals. Social media provides another, new layer of education through platforms where you can follow prominent real estate professionals who are providing tips and advice. Market data analysis prepares you to anticipate shifts, allowing you to adjust strategies effectively.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Working through hands-on workshops and learn-by-doing seminars is the smartest, most forward-thinking approach to honing your craft. Local workshops can get down to the nitty-gritty of what makes real estate tick. Engaging with trainers and speakers not only deepens your learning experience but helps to replicate the relationships you form with your peers.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Taking notes and doing the work of applying new concepts to your practice is crucial.

These agents are hands-on with their clients, meeting them and showing them properties.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">They take on all administrative duties, too, which means they’re often working evenings and weekends to meet their clients’ needs. This flexibility is crucial, as it enables them to handle client communications most effectively.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Continuing education on market trends and regulations is crucial, making sure they are passing along the most current advice and staying ahead of the curve.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"common-misconceptions\">Common Misconceptions</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Myth #3: Part-time agents are not as professional or committed as full-timers. In reality, most part-time agents do just fine, using the flexibility of their schedule to focus on what clients need.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The perception that part-time agents can’t be successful because of their limited hours is false. Plenty of part-time agents have six-figure sales and excellent reputations.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Their market potential, however, is significant. Part-time agents’ typical annual gross income is $54,766. A part-time role that only takes three to six months of training to qualify, it’s an easy field to break into.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">It’s ideal for ambitious high-income earners who want to do more in their spare time.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"can-you-be-a-parttime-real-estate-agent\">Can You Be a Part Time Real Estate Agent?</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"217\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/190fd8aac2e11748-Can-You-Be-a-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Agent.webp/public\" alt=\"Can You Be a Part Time Real Estate Agent\" class=\"wp-image-263270\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Can-You-Be-a-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Agent.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Can-You-Be-a-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Agent-300x65.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Can-You-Be-a-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Agent-768x167.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Thousands of people successfully develop part-time real estate careers while pursuing other vocations. This flexibility enables them to maintain their established careers while diving into the vibrant field of real estate. So, even if you’re a teacher, nurse, or office worker, you can make part-time real estate work on the side.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Finding the right fit is crucial. The most important thing is judging the flexibility of your current job to make sure it can work with real estate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"balancing-with-other-jobs\">Balancing with Other Jobs</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">To effectively balance your part-time real estate career with other jobs, schedule certain days for real estate duties such as open houses and client meetings to avoid schedule clashes. Keeping real estate tasks and your main source of income and work life separate can help you stay focused.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Additionally, being able to respond to clients and leads promptly is key to success. This responsiveness can significantly impact your ability to close deals and maintain client satisfaction.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"necessary-skills-and-qualities\">Necessary Skills and Qualities</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Part-time or not, successful agents have to be excellent communicators, negotiators, and time managers. Flexibility is important to accommodate different client schedules and demands.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Referencing the last two traits, your networking skills are what will help you build valuable relationships with other industry professionals. These relationships can lead to referrals and opportunities that enhance your real estate career.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">To minimize time spent, book all showings on one day per week. First, the obvious caveat is that real estate agents are always working under a licensed broker, but agents usually work evenings and weekends anyway.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Earnings vary from $5,000 to $50,000 per year. Furthermore, training and licensing can take weeks to months. This time investment is essential to ensure you are prepared for the demands of the real estate market.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"advantages-of-parttime-real-estate-work\">Advantages of Part Time Real Estate Work</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/01b094592c6c561d-Advantages-of-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Work.webp/public\" alt=\"Advantages of Part Time Real Estate Work\" class=\"wp-image-263274\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Advantages-of-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Work.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Advantages-of-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Work-300x58.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Advantages-of-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Work-768x149.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-flexible-schedule\">1. Flexible Schedule</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The flexibility of working part-time in real estate allows for a work-life schedule that best fits family and personal commitments. Whether family commitments, schooling, or other employment, agents have more freedom to choose their hours around other aspects of their lives.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Evenings and weekends—real estate’s peak hours—are perfect for meeting clients and showing properties. This flexibility means that agents can react quickly to client requirements, improving customer service significantly.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Your part-time agent schedules property viewings for Saturday mornings and/or after 5 PM on weekdays. In this manner, they make sure clients can make it when they have the time available.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-additional-income-stream\">2. Additional Income Stream</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The financial upside of part-time real estate work is huge—if you’re making real estate commissions and referrals, that’s income you wouldn’t have otherwise. Even with a part-time commitment, agents can make tremendous commissions on the sale of property.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Referral fees from simply connecting would-be buyers and sellers can boost that income even more. Diving into related side projects, like getting into property management or starting an independent consultancy, increases earning potential.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-career-transition-opportunities\">3. Career Transition Opportunities</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These part-time roles can be a launching pad to full-time collaborative work in the real estate field. A lot of agents do it and make the move from part-time to full-time, using their experience and their network.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Real estate companies place a premium on candidates with this real-world experience. Part-time work on your resume can be a tremendous advantage when applying for competitive full-time roles.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"4-skill-enhancement-for-parttime-real-estate-agents\">4. Skill Enhancement for Part Time Real Estate Agents</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The importance of continuous learning can’t be overstated in real estate. Part-time agents should spend time improving their craft, attending workshops and online courses, and staying in touch with market trends.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Practical experience gained through part-time roles helps sharpen negotiation, marketing, and customer service skills. These skills are crucial for career growth.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"5-networking-benefits\">5. Networking Benefits</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">In real estate, building a strong network is everything.

Solid relationships usually lead to more client referrals and greater achievements and recognition within the industry.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"disadvantages-of-parttime-real-estate-work\">Disadvantages of Part Time Real Estate Work</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"limited-time-commitment\">Limited Time Commitment</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Part-time real estate work means limited hours, which cuts down on how many clients you can take on. This can make it really tough to cultivate a good pool of clientele. Clients would often need to touch base with lenders and appraisers as well, which usually requires business hours availability.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Good management and efficient scheduling become very important. Prioritize your time to maximize the hours you can dedicate to showings, often after 5:30 pm, and manage contracts and inspections around your schedule.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"income-uncertainty\">Income Uncertainty</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Income for part-time agents would be difficult given that these agents earn income through commission-based sales. When you don’t have a guaranteed salary, it’s crucial to budget your money wisely.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">New agents often go several months without a paycheck, making financial preparedness all the more critical. Reserve a portion of funds to cover drops in revenue. Further, be mindful of expenses, like costly brokerage fees, which can significantly eat into your profit.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"restricted-brokerage-options\">Restricted Brokerage Options</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">In addition, part-time agents might have a difficult time getting a seat at the table at larger brokerages that would rather hire full-time agents. You might find greater opportunities by looking at smaller or independent brokerages.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This can be a great solution for people who are working a traditional 9-5 and pursuing real estate on the side.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"challenges-in-market-knowledge\">Challenges in Market Knowledge</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Part-time hours can make it hard to keep up with local market trends. Put in the time for research and education to stay up-to-date with all aspects of the market.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"managing-client-expectations\">Managing Client Expectations</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Setting expectations with false communication regarding their availability or response time is key. Establish reasonable service level expectations and communicate regularly on progress and timing with clients.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"facing-competition\">Facing Competition</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Given how competitive the real estate market is, it’s ideal for part-time agents to go above and beyond to separate themselves from the pack.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Through honing a personal brand, agents can stand out from the competition and provide real value that draws in clients.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"steps-to-become-a-parttime-real-estate-agent\">Steps to Become a Part Time Real Estate Agent</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"179\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/242d08ed000c1fc4-Steps-to-Become-a-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Agent.webp/public\" alt=\"Steps to Become a Part Time Real Estate Agent\" class=\"wp-image-263272\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Steps-to-Become-a-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Agent.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Steps-to-Become-a-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Agent-300x54.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Steps-to-Become-a-Part-Time-Real-Estate-Agent-768x137.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"meet-eligibility-requirements\">Meet Eligibility Requirements</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Once you’ve decided that part-time real estate is right for you, the first step to becoming a licensed agent is learning what the eligibility requirements are. To be able to practice, you have to be at least 18 years of age.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">You have to be a legal resident of your state and clear a background check. These criteria can vary by state, so be sure to check your individual state’s requirements to confirm that you are in full compliance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"complete-required-courses\">Complete Required Courses</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Enrolling in a real estate course is an important first step in acquiring the knowledge necessary to thrive. Approved schools provide prelicensing courses that teach you the basic practices of real estate as well as state and federal laws.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Online courses offer the most flexibility, letting you work on other things you’re committed to while getting ready for the exam.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"pass-the-licensing-exam\">Pass the Licensing Exam</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">It is important to pass the state’s real estate licensing exam. Study smart. Develop good study habits, including creating a study schedule, taking practice exams, and identifying important real estate topics and terminology.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Finding a balance between theoretical knowledge and real-life, practical scenarios is key to building confidence.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"submit-application-and-background-check\">Submit Application and Background Check</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Once you pass the exam, you’ll need to apply for a real estate license. You’ll be required to complete a background check to complete your licensing process.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Keep all paperwork in order, complete, and ready to prevent any hiccups in your process from happening.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"join-professional-associations\">Join Professional Associations</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Being a member of these associations helps you network and gives you access to valuable resources. Participate in local and national conferences for continuing education and professional development.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These connections can help you slide into your next big opportunity.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"strategies-for-success-as-a-parttime-agent\">Strategies for Success as a Part-Time Agent</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"manage-your-time-wisely\">Manage Your Time Wisely</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Developing a firm calendar is important. Establish guided time blocks for your real estate activities. Then, put these on your calendar so clients know when and where they can find you.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Scheduling apps can maximize your time by scheduling meetings and property showings quickly and easily. Limit in-person interactions even further by holding all showings and consultations on one day each week. In this manner, you limit your obligations while avoiding the sense of drowning.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">To have your pipeline always filled with new business, schedule time for lead generation, and follow up with leads.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"set-achievable-goals\">Set Achievable Goals</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">It’s important to set specific, achievable, and measurable goals. SMART short- and long-term marketing goals keep you focused and on the right path.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By creating shorter, more achievable, and measurable steps, you can keep the motivation and momentum going. Schedule times to regularly review these goals to adjust marketing strategies and make sure you’re on a path to consistent progress.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This practice is what will continue to get you in tune with both the market and your own personal development.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"use-technology-for-efficiency\">Use Technology for Efficiency</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Technology is at the heart of real estate today. CRM tools manage client information, streamlining interactions and maintaining relationships.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Digital business cards automatically sync with your CRM, eliminating hours of data entry time to your pipeline. Use social media to increase your visibility and generate leads, getting far more with far less effort.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"build-a-strong-client-base\">Build a Strong Client Base</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Building strong client relationships is key to landing repeat business and referrals.

Usually, agents make money off of a percentage of the sale price of each property they sell. That’s because the more properties you’re able to sell, or the more expensive they are, the more money you stand to make.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Intentional sales and strong referrals will help you maximize income. Closing just a handful of high-value deals will have you raking in the success. Plus, referrals from happy customers will continue to boost your reputation and referral opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"factors-influencing-earnings\">Factors Influencing Earnings</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">There are many different factors that affect how much a part-time agent makes. Location is crucial, too—places where the market is clamoring for homes usually offer the more profitable prospects.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Additionally, your experience and skill level will further influence your earning potential. Experienced agents with polished negotiation skills are more likely to get deals closed quickly and easily.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Focus On Markets With High Demand To Increase Your Earning Potential. By finding out what each of your clients needs and focusing on that high-value task, you’ll ensure you make it rain!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"average-income-expectations\">Average Income Expectations</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Taking on an average of four or five deals per year for part-time agents would net them an income of $59,200 to $98,700. Transaction volume introduces volatility into income.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Agents who work under 20 hours per week average around $21,000, and those who work 21 to 39 hours an average of $63,500. It’s important to set realistic income goals, based on how much time you plan to invest.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Balancing part-time work with income aspirations involves understanding market conditions and personal dedication.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Provide an eye-catching title using the keyword and rewrite just the introduction. Make the intro shorter, add pain points of agents, do not &#8220;give away&#8221; the details of what the agent will learn by reading the blog, and add bolded text on keywords for visual interest.

They can range from practical items to unique, personalized, fun gifts. Useful gifts could be things like digital picture frames that show images of lovely moments, so clients think of their realtor’s kindness often.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Customized gifts, such as engraved cutting boards or serving trays, speak volumes about thoughtfulness and detail. A beautifully appointed realtor gift basket with Eryn’s Home and Gifts adds a touch of sophistication and it won’t break the bank! These gifts can be customized to your client’s personality, like creating personalized holiday ornaments for clients who appreciate seasonal traditions.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Select gifts that convey the beauty of the real estate journey. Ensure they’re in line with the realtor’s personal brand and style. Closing gifts are usually given upon the completion of a transaction. General realtor gifts can be given at any time, which can go a long way in building a strong relationship.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"why-realtor-gifts-matter\">Why Realtor Gifts Matter</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Realtor gifts are an essential part of maintaining a lifetime of client relationships. Considerate gifting leads to lasting impressions leading to repeat business. When clients feel valued, they are more willing to refer their realtor to friends and family.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Especially in a hot competitive market, these gifts help realtors stand out. Your digital picture frame example may be a great way to leave them with a more memorable impression, resulting in more referrals. Although they’re not necessary, surprise gifts after closing can help express gratitude and encourage long-term client loyalty.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Realtors often budget 1% – 2% of their commission for closing gifts. However, the IRS allows a deduction of no more than $25 per person per year. This tactic ensures long-term business by way of happy customers who will give you referrals and positive reviews.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"personal-touch-in-realtor-gifts\">Personal Touch in Realtor Gifts</h2>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Adding a personal touch to realtor gifts is a great way to make yourself memorable. Here are some ways to achieve this:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Personalized items like engraved cutting boards, monogrammed towels, or picture frames show thoughtfulness.</li>\n<li>Consider the client&#8217;s hobbies. A wine connoisseur would love a special bottle or a garden lover custom engraved garden stone.</li>\n<li>Incorporate local goods to support community businesses and offer a taste of the area.</li>\n<li>Gifts that align with a realtor&#8217;s brand and values strengthen client relationships.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-thoughtful-reviews-as-gifts\">1. Thoughtful Reviews as Gifts</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Realtors can ask for and publish glowing testimonials as a thank you. These positive comments go a long way in building an online presence and credibility.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Personal touches, like thanking clients who leave reviews with small tokens, can help continue to nurture those relationships.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Creating a process for monitoring and replying to reviews means no client will slip through the cracks without a thank you.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-social-media-acknowledgments\">2. Social Media Acknowledgments</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">By publicly thanking clients on social media, and tagging them, of course, you strengthen relationships while boosting visibility.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Tagging your clients in posts showing off their new gifts or recent accomplishments will help you get exposure to potential new clients.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-handwritten-thankyou-notes\">3. Handwritten Thank-you Notes</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Handwritten thank-you notes soon after closing deals make an impact.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Including transaction details in personalized notes makes clients feel special and appreciated.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Having notes available makes sending a personal touch quick and easy.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"food-and-beverage-gift-ideas\">Food and Beverage Gift Ideas</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"170\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a99aa6ad51c9c815-15-Client-Gifts-for-Realtors-Food-and-Beverage-Gift-Ideas.webp/public\" alt=\"15+ Client Gifts for Realtors, Food and Beverage Gift Ideas\" class=\"wp-image-263007\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/15-Client-Gifts-for-Realtors-Food-and-Beverage-Gift-Ideas.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/15-Client-Gifts-for-Realtors-Food-and-Beverage-Gift-Ideas-300x51.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/15-Client-Gifts-for-Realtors-Food-and-Beverage-Gift-Ideas-768x131.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Food and beverage gifts are always a thoughtful option for realtors looking to show appreciation to their clients.

Personalize baskets according to clients’ tastes or food restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Cheery, bright, fresh fruits and vegetables produce a beautiful gift.

Wine Coasters and Glasses</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Think about finer gifts, such as wine coasters or crystal glasses, which all contribute to home entertaining.

Prepare the Property</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Creating a comprehensive checklist is a great first step to making sure you have all your property preparations in order. Start by clearing out spaces to showcase your home’s space and flow. Deep clean every surface, from the floors to the windows, to the bathrooms, to ensure you leave a sparkling impression.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">The outside requires some work as well; increasing curb appeal with landscaping and cleaning up exterior areas can help get people in the door.

Design Marketing Materials</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Creating eye-catching flyers and brochures helps too. They need to be rich in property specifics, photos, and amenities in the area. Attractive, consistent branding across all materials is a must, with contact information prominently displayed to make it easy for prospective tenants to inquire.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"5-notify-neighbors\">5.

Hashtags that are popular in the real estate space, as well as the local area, help widen your potential reach.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Creative storytelling through Instagram stories or reels can provide behind-the-scenes looks at the property. Motivating followers to share user-generated content builds awareness.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-send-email-announcements\">2. Send Email Announcements</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Compelling email announcements reach your entire client list and help get the word out about the open house. Highlighting some of the key features and content, and including a prominent call-to-action increases attendance.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Email list segmentation allows you to target different demographics. Reminder emails a week or two out from the event date can help boost the expected turnout even more.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-advertise-on-real-estate-platforms\">3. Advertise on Real Estate Platforms</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Publishing to major real estate platforms like Zillow, Realtor.com, and Trulia increases the potential audience even further. Paid advertising opportunities help to improve visibility.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">In a competitive landscape like rentals, detailed property descriptions and high-quality images are vital to capturing the most interest. Using performance metrics to track performance and return on investment determines which paid platforms provide the most successful outcomes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"4-engage-existing-clients\">4. Engage Existing Clients</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Inviting your existing clients to the open house builds referral business. Sending personalized invitations shows your clients you care about them.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Providing their customers with updates on new listings and local market trends makes them feel in the loop. This creates loyalty and future business opportunities.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"two-days-prior-preparation\">Two Days Prior to Preparation</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"214\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/a5d813d172a737d5-Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Two-Days-Prior-to-Preparation.webp/public\" alt=\"Open House Checklist for Agents The Secret to 2x More Offers, Two Days Prior to Preparation\" class=\"wp-image-262998\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Two-Days-Prior-to-Preparation.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Two-Days-Prior-to-Preparation-300x64.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Two-Days-Prior-to-Preparation-768x164.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Making a to-do list is the best way to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. It plays a critical role in ensuring that all of our ducks are in a row two days prior to the open house. This means ensuring all marketing materials are available and shared to ensure the greatest exposure.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Flyers, social media posts, email blasts, etc., all need to be carefully proofed to ensure they are effective and free of mistakes. Performing a final walkthrough of the property is key. This gives us a guaranteed clean house.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Keep it all clean, and be prepared to make some quick fixes. Today is the ideal time to tweak or finalize any last-minute improvements. Think about including some live flowers or changing up your space with new decor to make your space even more attractive!</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-preview-on-instagram\">1. Preview on Instagram</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Give a behind-the-scenes look at the open house on Instagram. This is a great way to build excitement around your campaign among your followers. Share visually appealing content such as photos or virtual tours that showcase the property’s unique features.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">In addition, adding countdowns to your stories is a great way to create buzz. Offer a referral incentive, like having your followers tag friends who would be interested.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-conduct-local-outreach\">2. Conduct Local Outreach</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Partner with your chambers of commerce and other local businesses and organizations to help promote the open house. Deliver pamphlets to local shops and coffee shops. Building relationships with your local community members can go a long way in getting to those first-time buyers.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Promoting the event wherever you are with local audiences is a savvy move to get more people through the door.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-review-interaction-scripts\">3. Review Interaction Scripts</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Write talking points or scripts if you want to have active engagement with visitors. Develop and practice responses to common questions about the home, property, and neighborhood. Customize these scripts to speak to any objections that your would-be buyers may have.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Rehearsing with fellow staff can help build confidence and ensure a clear and effective delivery during the open house itself.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"4-prepare-signin-methods\">4. Prepare Sign-in Methods</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Create a sign-in sheet to gather visitor information. Digital sign-ins provide a more high-tech approach to data gathering. Make sure visitor privacy is always protected.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Use this information to both determine interest and focus future marketing efforts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"open-house-day-essentials\">Open House Day Essentials</h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"167\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/cd44e413fc31182d-Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Open-House-Day-Essentials.webp/public\" alt=\"Open House Checklist for Agents The Secret to 2x More Offers, Open House Day Essentials\" class=\"wp-image-262997\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Open-House-Day-Essentials.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Open-House-Day-Essentials-300x50.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Open-House-Checklist-for-Agents-The-Secret-to-2x-More-Offers-Open-House-Day-Essentials-768x128.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">When you plan an open house, the name of the game is having all your ducks in a row. Start by making sure you have everything you need on hand. This means property brochures, pens, sign-in sheets, and business cards. Each item needs to be pretty close to perfect for when visitors walk through the door.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Secondly, ensure the property is professionally cleaned and staged. A clean, well-staged home will go a long way. Walk through your checklist to ensure that each and every item is done well in advance of the day of the event. Getting there early allows you to get things set up and address any last-minute changes or needs.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-install-directional-signs\">1. Install Directional Signs</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Directional signs are essential. Location is key, so use them to channel visitors. Signs need to be large enough to be read easily from the road, but inviting up close and personal.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Make sure they comply with local regulations regarding placement and visibility. Adding something like balloons or flags can really make them pop.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-display-welcome-materials\">2. Display Welcome Materials</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Producing that first warm welcome is key. Have welcome materials ready at the door. Consider including brochures, business cards, and sign-in sheets.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Refreshments and snacks go a long way to making it an uplifting experience. Welcoming signs can help ease guests’ discomfort.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-offer-refreshments\">3. Offer Refreshments</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Refreshments go a long way toward making guests feel comfortable. Provide light refreshments or refreshments that are easy to enjoy while walking around.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">These can act as great conversation starters. Be sure to keep the area clean during your event.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"4-engage-with-visitors\">4. Engage with Visitors</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Connecting with your potential visitors is key. Welcome people and ask probing questions to uncover what they’re looking for.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Provide vivid descriptions of your property. Make sure that everyone else is prepared to help with any questions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"postopen-house-activities\">Post-Open House Activities</h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"1-collect-visitor-feedback\">1. Collect Visitor Feedback</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Consider administering a feedback form to attempt to get a more accurate picture of overall visitor impressions. Whether you use a formal survey or a more informal conversation, find out what worked and what didn’t for your guests.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Pinpointing these shared themes or recommendations is essential because it aids in honing future events. By formalizing this process of feedback documentation, you will have useful communication tools for future planning and for attracting and improving future open houses.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">If you get a lot of feedback saying that the signage was confusing, then you can make sure to improve that when you do your next event.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"2-update-crm-with-contacts\">2. Update CRM with Contacts</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Make sure all visitor information is quickly input into your CRM system. This step is crucial for ongoing engagement and post-event follow-up.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Segment these contacts based on their interest levels and potential buyer status. With the right CRM tools, keeping track of interactions and tailoring future communication becomes a breeze.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">It’s equally important to adhere to data protection regulations when storing this data, to protect your audience and company.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"3-follow-up-with-leads\">3. Follow Up with Leads</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Follow up promptly with leads generated at the open house to capitalize on the interest. Create tailored follow-up communications based on each person’s unique experience, providing additional information on properties or answering any outstanding inquiries.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">This targeted, personalized touch is key to continuing to build those relationships and turn more potential buyers into actual sales.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"4-analyze-event-success\">4. Analyze Event Success</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Look at attendance and comments to measure the success of your open house. Analyze outreach efforts to determine their effectiveness and figure out what you can do better next time.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Take these learnings and apply them to future events to come up with more realistic goals and pave the way for repeat success.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading pm-align--left\" id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Preparing a property before an open house involves thorough cleaning, decluttering, and staging, ensuring an inviting atmosphere for potential buyers.</li>\n<li>A good home stager will bring in neutral but elegant furniture and decor that emphasizes the home’s best features and downplays any flaws.</li>\n<li>High-quality photography is essential.
