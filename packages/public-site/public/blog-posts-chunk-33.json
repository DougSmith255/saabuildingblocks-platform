But hey, we’re not talking about just any account. When it comes to showcasing your agent prowess, opt for a professional-sounding account. This isn’t the place for your &#8220;beachbum123&#8221; email; think more like &#8220;KarrieHillRealEstate.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Set Up Your New YouTube Channel</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4497\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3f92b2074f6b51ee-1-2.webp/public\" alt=\"Realtor watching the YouTube logo on a computer screen, considering the platform&#039;s potential for real estate marketing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"455\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-2-300x137.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-2-768x349.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now, onto the fun part—<strong>naming your YouTube channel</strong>. This is where you can let your creativity flow, but keep it simple. Avoid the trap of complexity. No need for &#8220;The Exquisite and Comprehensive Guide to Homes in Marin County by Karrie.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You want a name that’s easy to recall. How about &#8220;Karrie Hill Real Estate”, “Karrie Hill Marin County Realtor”, or “Living in Marin County”?</p>\n<p>Your channel name should be closely tied to real estate. Your location and career title are your best allies in crafting a channel name that’s both searchable and memorable. Choose a name that ensures it’s a no-brainer for viewers to connect the dots that you are an agent in a particular location.</p>\n<h2 id=\"branding-tips-for-your-real-estate-youtube-channel\">Branding Tips for Your Real Estate YouTube Channel</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4558\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/95b9214c2587d523-1-4.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"408\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-4-300x122.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-4-768x313.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of your profile picture, channel banner, channel description, or a plan for your thumbnails, you’ll want to think about your branding.</p>\n<p>Branding is all about <strong>making your business stand out</strong> and be remembered by people who might want to use it. It includes things like your business name, logo, how your business looks, what you stand for, and the way you talk to people. In other words, the overall look of your business.</p>\n<h3 id=\"consistent-color-and-logo-for-memorable-real-estate-branding\">Consistent Color and Logo for Memorable Real Estate Branding</h3>\n<p>To properly brand your YouTube channel, everything about your channel, your pictures, banner, and thumbnails should look like they all come from the same place.</p>\n<h4 id=\"choosing-a-color-scheme-that-defines-who-you-are\">Choosing a Color Scheme that Defines Who You Are</h4>\n<p>A good way to do this is by using the <strong>same color scheme</strong> in your banner and thumbnails. By choosing specific colors for your channel banner and thumbnails, viewers will associate those colors with your brand. For example, if you always use blue and green, people will start to connect those colors with your channel.</p>\n<p>Choose your colors wisely. Different colors invoke different meanings and emotions. Search Google for the meaning of different colors to make that more in line with what your vibe is.</p>\n<h4 id=\"choosing-a-logo-for-real-estate\">Choosing a Logo for Your Channel</h4>\n<p>Using a <strong>consistent logo</strong> helps viewers recognize your content quickly. Think of it as putting your stamp on every video you make. It&#8217;s like when you see a red can with white letters, you know it&#8217;s Coca-Cola without even reading it.</p>\n<p>You can use your brokerage’s logo or your own.  If you use your own, make your logo in the same colors as your brand colors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"customizing-your-youtube-channel\">Customizing Your YouTube Channel</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4559\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/272d5f22c8f70eb0-2-4.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"329\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-4-300x99.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-4-768x253.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you know what your branding will be, you can get started with personalizing your channel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"uploading-a-professional-profile-picture\">Uploading a Professional Profile Picture</h3>\n<p>Adding professional headshots to your banner and your thumbnails makes things <strong>more personal</strong>. People get to see your face and get to know you.</p>\n<p>Your headshot should look professional but friendly. You want potential clients to feel like they can approach you with their questions or for help buying or selling their home.</p>\n<p>Be sure to place your photo with a background of one or more of your branding colors. That’s to keep everything consistent. If you want to add the color yourself, head on over to canva.com where you can remove the background of any headshot and replace it with your branded colors.</p>\n<p>When complete, add your photo by selecting “Customization”, and then “Branding”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-professions-channel-banner-for-your-real-estate-channel\">Creating a Professions Channel Banner for Your Real Estate Channel</h3>\n<p>Also in the “Branding” tab is where you add your channel banner. Channel banners are important because they’re one of the first things someone sees when they go to your page. Create a banner that is customized to your brand. Again, use Canva to make your banner.</p>\n<p>Canva has pre-made templates that make it easy to create your own with your branded colors.  If you’re not sure what these banners generally look like, do a search of all the banners done by realtors in your local market or beyond.</p>\n<p>Keep your banner clean and uncluttered looking.  Clutter overwhelms viewers and they are unlikely to read everything on a banner with too much information.</p>\n<p>Once you have an idea of the general look you prefer, add the needed information &#8211; name, contact, what you do, and your real estate salesperson license number.  If you don’t feel up to the task of creating your own banner, hire someone on <strong>Fiverr.com to do it for you.</strong></p>\n<p>Once done, add your banner to YouTube by again selecting “Customization” and then the “Branding” tab.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crafting-an-effective-channel-description-for-your-real-estate-channel\">Crafting an Effective Channel Description for Your Real Estate Channel</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4566 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/30a02e778881f159-Dezgergerg.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"426\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dezgergerg.webp 426w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dezgergerg-300x201.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" /></p>\n<p>Still in “Customization”, move over to the “Basic Info” tab to write your channel description. Your description should be at least 250 words long and have the most important information in the first 100-150 words.</p>\n<p>Here, you’ll tell viewers who you are and what you do. Fill in this part with your contact information, services offered, and <strong>what makes you different from other realtor.</strong> Keep it simple but informative.</p>\n<p>Also, consistency matters! Your description can be the same one on your website, Facebook page, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"looking-your-best-with-more-elements\">Looking Your Best With More YouTube Elements</h3>\n<p>Again, still in “Customization”, go to the “Layout” tab. Here, you’ll want to add a channel trailer and choose featured sections.</p>\n<h4 id=\"upload-a-channel-trailer\"><strong>Upload a Channel Trailer</strong></h4>\n<p>When people come to your page, this is usually the first video they will see and it is super important. Think of it like a <strong>mini-ad</strong> for what you do.</p>\n<p>Your channel trailer should inform viewers about who you are, what your business is about, and what they&#8217;ll get from watching your videos. Since it&#8217;s the first thing they see, make it good! Good lighting, good sound!</p>\n<h4 id=\"create-video-playlists\">Create Video Playlists</h4>\n<p>You’ll want to create video playlists for two reasons.</p>\n<p>First, playlists allow you to organize your channel’s content by topic.  You may have one playlist for property tours, another for tips about living in your town, and still another for home buyer or home seller tips.  Playlists help keep your channel tidy and user-friendly. Viewers appreciate being able to find exactly what they need without hassle.</p>\n<p>Second, playlists allow you to create more featured sections which helps the overall appearance of your channel, especially when just starting.  We’ll discuss more about featured sections next.  But first, here’s how to create a playlist.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to have already made a video.  When you upload that video, you’ll add the video details (here’s where your video description goes).  Below that you’ll see “Playlists”.  Hit the drop-down and choose “New Playlist” and add a name for that playlist.  That name will become part of the drop-down menu from there on out when you upload new videos.</p>\n<h4 id=\"add-featured-sections\">Add Featured Sections</h4>\n<p>Now that you’ve created playlists, you’ll want to create featured sections. Caution &#8211; if you don’t choose featured sections, when viewers first come to your page, YouTube only displays one row of your videos.  That will make it look like your channel has barely any content which may discourage some viewers from subscribing to your channel.</p>\n<p>Thus, you’ll want to add featured sections to your channel as soon as you start your channel – even if you have less than 6 videos.  To do that go back to the “Customization”, “Layout” tab and choose featured sections.</p>\n<p>Having the featured sections will fill up your channel page, even repeating some videos when you choose a section of “Popular Videos” as well as the same videos being in single playlists.</p>\n<p>The bottom line &#8211; this will help your new channel appear to have more content than it really has.  That’s all good when first starting your channel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maximizing-visibility-for-your-real-estate-youtube-channel\">Maximizing Visibility for Your Real Estate YouTube Channel</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4560\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d80f7d889aef719a-3-3.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"391\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-3.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-3-300x117.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-3-768x300.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"harnessing-the-power-of-keyword-research\">Harnessing the Power of Keyword Research</h3>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve customized your channel, it&#8217;s time to dig into the nitty-gritty of keyword research. Diving into keyword research is a <strong>pivotal step</strong> in ensuring your channel doesn&#8217;t just exist but thrives and reaches the right viewers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"discover-whats-trending\"><strong>Discover What&#8217;s Trending</strong></h4>\n<p>Keyword research is all about understanding what potential buyers or sellers in your area are actively searching for online. You want to discover what they are searching for and then make video content about that.</p>\n<p>There are several free tools you can use to uncover the search volume of specific terms. Try “Keywords Everywhere” or Google Trends.  Plug in a phrase you think might work and you’ll see the association search volume for that keyword.</p>\n<p>A high search volume indicates a term&#8217;s popularity. For example, identifying that &#8220;homes for sale in [Your Area]&#8221; is a frequently searched term can steer you toward creating highly relevant content.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-magic-of-long-tail-keywords\"><strong>The Magic of Long-Tail Keywords</strong></h4>\n<p>Incorporating long-tail keywords into your strategy is a game-changer. These phrases are longer and more detailed than others.  But long-tail keywords can work great.  For one, they often signal that someone is nearing a decision point. And, for two, long tail keywords face less competition but carry a high conversion potential.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of targeting “Homes for Sale in Marin”, use a long-tail keyword that targets &#8220;affordable family homes near Redwood High School&#8221; – much more specific. Doing a long tail keyword like that can directly connect you with audiences with specific living preferences that will lead that person right to your content.</p>\n<h4 id=\"embrace-local-insights\"><strong>Embrace Local Insights</strong></h4>\n<p>Incorporating local landmarks or neighborhoods into your keywords and video titles can <strong>significantly impact your content&#8217;s discoverability.</strong> Searchers often use these local pointers to find properties within specific areas of interest.</p>\n<p>Crafting videos titled “Best Family Neighborhoods Near [Landmark]” or “Why Live In [Neighborhood]” helps SEO (Search Engine Optimization) find your content. It also cements your reputation as the go-to local real estate authority in those locations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leveraging-seo-for-real-estate-on-youtube\"><strong>Leveraging SEO for on YouTube</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4562 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/fca52fd93f264d7e-2-5.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-5.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-5-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Understanding the art of keyword selection is just the beginning of enabling your audience to find your videos. Now, let&#8217;s delve into strategic placement to further enhance the visibility of your videos.</p>\n<h4 id=\"crafting-search-friendly-video-titles\"><strong>Crafting Search-Friendly Video Titles</strong></h4>\n<p>The title of your videos is searchable on Google and YouTube so the chosen title is the first chance to put your video in front of potential viewers. Incorporating precise, targeted keywords within your titles is key to ensuring your videos appear in search results.</p>\n<p>For instance, if your focus is on the Los Angeles market, a title like “Discover the Top 5 Los Angeles Homes for Sale | 2024 Insider’s Guide” not only captures attention with specific keywords such as “homes for sale” and “Los Angeles” but also appeals to those actively searching for real estate opportunities in that area.</p>\n<h3><strong>Designing Captivating Thumbnails with Engaging Hooks</strong></h3>\n<p>Thumbnails, those little rectangular images that are used as a video preview, help attract people to choose your video over others with the same topic. It&#8217;s essential to craft thumbnails that complement but don’t duplicate your title. Creating both a keyword title and a thumbnail that is different than your title gives you two shots to attract a viewer.</p>\n<p>Note, that because video titles are searchable, be sure to use your keywords there. Thumbnail words are not yet searchable as they are images only. So, use your thumbnail to intrigue and promise value.</p>\n<p>But don’t go so far in your thumbnail design as resorting to clickbait which uses exaggerations that ultimately disappoint viewers.  Clickbait will eventually harm a channel’s success. Instead, on your thumbnail, highlight an intriguing fact or feature from your video that is both truthful and enticing.</p>\n<h3><strong>Enhancing Video Descriptions and Utilizing Tags</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4561 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6bc706a70d1d3e06-3-4.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-4.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-4-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>The description of your video is another valuable space to provide further insight into your content and embed relevant keywords to increase your video’s searchable reach.</p>\n<p>But do more here. Include links to your professional website, contact details, and any free value you offer &#8211; like buyer and seller guides. This helps convert viewers into potential leads.</p>\n<p>Additionally, add tags wisely to align your videos’ topics with what your target audience would search to find your video. When you read your tags, it should be crystal clear what your video is about.</p>\n<p>Additionally, add timestamps to your video so viewers can get to the information they most seek elevating the quality of your content for them and encouraging them to come back for more.</p>\n<p>For example, if your video is about homes for sale in Marin, use tags like: “homes for sale in Marin”, “Marin homes for sale”, “homes for sale in Marin County”, “Marin County homes for sale”, “available homes in Marin”, available homes in Marin County,… Don’t also add “how to prep a home for sale” or “when to sell your home” as these are not what your video is about.</p>\n<p>Include long tail tags to catch those who are looking exactly for information like your video. Use all 500 characters available toward this tag task.</p>\n<p>Last, if you struggle with determining what your tags should be consider paying for YouTube Buddy or Vid IQ to get guidance.</p>\n<h3><strong>Engagement Metrics</strong></h3>\n<p>The last thing to mention in your quest to ensure that maximum viewers see your videos is encouraging engagement with your content. The YouTube algorithm cares about viewer interaction. To that end, comments play a pivotal role. To amplify your video&#8217;s recommendation potential, actively encourage viewers to engage by initiating conversations.</p>\n<p>Prompt your audience with thought-provoking questions related to the video topic, encouraging them to share their insights in the comments section. You could say something like, “What’s been YOUR experience with buying property? Let me know in the comments below!” or “What do you think of these homes for sale?”</p>\n<p>Encouraging comments and getting comments, fosters a community around your content and signals to YouTube that your video is generating interest.  This increases the likelihood of  YouTube promoting your content to new viewers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Starting a YouTube channel for real estate agents involves several key steps to establish a strong digital presence. From crafting a unique digital identity and setting up your channel with consistent branding elements like colors and logos, to customizing your profile with professional images and an effective channel description, these foundational actions set the stage for success.</p>\n<p>Enhancing your channel&#8217;s visibility through strategic SEO practices, including keyword research, engaging thumbnails, and optimized video descriptions, is crucial. Together, these steps ensure your real estate YouTube channel not only attracts but also retains a targeted audience interested in your content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-our-free-group-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Getting these contracts signed seems like a hassle to many buyer agents, especially when many homebuyers think buyer agent services are freebies courtesy of the seller.</p>\n<p>Instead, buyer agents often rely on an unspoken trust that the listing agreement in the MLS will secure their compensation for their efforts, which usually means a slice of the sale, typically between 2.5% to 3%</p>\n<p>But hello, wake-up call! The game is changing. A major shakeup is transforming the once-reliable commission structure as some MLS entries already, right now, are flaunting a big, fat zero in the commission field for buyer agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"\" class=\"pm-align--left\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">What’s the Problem for Buyer Agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Imagine this scenario: you&#8217;ve been hustling for a client, dedicating days, weeks, or heavens forbid, years, and suddenly that client is eyeing a property that is sporting that big fat zero in the commission field for the buyer agent. Ouch. How are you going to get paid for your work?</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Yes, even with court case resolutions still pending, the emergence of 0% commissions is already squeezing buyer agents. So before you start brushing all these court cases as some distant nightmare, reality check: this zero-commission trend is happening right now, as we speak.</p>\n<h3 id=\"\" class=\"pm-align--left\">What’s the Solution for Buyer Agents?</h3>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">What&#8217;s the solution? It&#8217;s simple, really. Get those buyer representation contracts signed, sealed, and delivered. It&#8217;s not just a smart move—it&#8217;s downright essential for safeguarding your hard-earned compensation.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">And here&#8217;s the kicker: we&#8217;re not just talking about securing those buyer representation agreements only for new clients. Nope, it&#8217;s time to hit the rewind button and go back to square one. Lock in those agreements for every client you&#8217;re currently working with, pronto.</p>\n<p class=\"pm-align--left\">Make a buyer representation agreement a non-negotiable part of your toolkit moving forward. You&#8217;ll be patting yourself on the back down the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crafting-compelling-homebuyer-presentations\">Crafting Compelling Homebuyer Presentations</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5593\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/dca0adb442b1cc2c-3-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"380\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2-300x114.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-2-768x292.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>With these looming transformations in the real estate business, the homebuying process will gain more clarity. With the dust settling, homebuyers will finally grasp the reality that they&#8217;re footing the bill for their buyer agent&#8217;s services, one way or another.</p>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s subtly embedded in the home&#8217;s price, as the current practice embeds it, or if it emerges as part of the closing costs—something increasingly likely to become the norm. This newfound transparency regarding the true cost of a buyer agent will prompt a seismic shift in the real estate industry.</p>\n<p>Homebuyers, now armed with this knowledge, are poised to meticulously assess and compare the caliber of service and personal attention offered by different buyer agents like never before. Welcome to the age of clear value demonstration, where buyer agents must rise to the occasion or risk being left in the dust.</p>\n<p>So, real estate buyer agents, it’s crucial now to master the art of Buyer Presentations. Here’s what you need to nail:</p>\n<h3>Demystify the Homebuying Process</h3>\n<p>First up, you’ll need to do what you have hopefully been doing all along and that is laying the home buying process out clearly from A to Z. That is, make sure your clients understand each step they’ll navigate with you on their journey to homeownership.</p>\n<h3>Showcase Real Estate Buyer Agent Services</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5594 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/3f92b2074f6b51ee-1-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-2.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-2-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>What exactly do you bring to the table? Detail the scope of your services and the direct benefits clients can expect from your dedicated representation. Have you ever made a list of all the services you provide?</p>\n<p>If not, no worries, we&#8217;ve got your back. Keep an eye out for our upcoming blog, “A Bright Future for Real Estate Buyer Agents – 117 Services of Agent Value” for a comprehensive rundown.</p>\n<h3>Clarify Buyer Agent Compensation</h3>\n<p>And, now the hard part and the biggest change in how we buyer agents have been doing business. So, here&#8217;s the deal: now buyer agents must openly discuss how we&#8217;re compensated for the time and expertise we bring to the table.</p>\n<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more. Buyer agents need to pull back the curtain on the expenses we shoulder for our homebuyers. Many consumers are in the dark about the fact that we&#8217;re essentially working on contingency, pouring time and money into each deal with no guarantee of payment until the ink dries on closing day.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s draw a parallel here. Ever heard of lawyers working on contingency? They rake in higher fees for their successes, balancing out the risk of potentially not getting paid at all. Well, guess what? The same principle applies to us real estate agents.</p>\n<p>So, the next time someone tells you real estate agents are overpaid, it&#8217;s time to set the record straight. Break it down for them: we&#8217;re not just clocking in hours, weeks, and months for kicks and giggles. There&#8217;s a significant risk involved, and the only way to make it worth our while is by ensuring the pot at the end of the rainbow reflects that added risk.</p>\n<h3>Highlight Real Estate Brokerage Benefits</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5595 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/8b3cf7fb60b959ea-2-3.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-3.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-3-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>With this homebuyer presentation, you&#8217;ll be showcasing your value as a trusted agent, but don’t forget about the powerhouse behind the scenes: your brokerage.</p>\n<p>From safeguards to mitigate agent errors to streamlined systems enhancing the buyer experience, make it crystal clear why your brokerage is the top choice for savvy home buyers seeking expertise and excellence.</p>\n<h3>Define Your Real Estate Agent Distinctiveness</h3>\n<p>And last, it&#8217;s time to crank up the volume and showcase what makes you stand out from the crowd. What&#8217;s your buyer agent secret sauce? Is it your unmatched local expertise, unconventional services, or exclusive perks? Whatever it is, it’s time to make your unique agent value take center stage.</p>\n<p>Bottom line, with all these components, your buyer presentations are about to scale the highest peaks of excellence! In this ever-changing industry, think of these presentations as your ticket to not just inform, but to dazzle and captivate potential clients.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re talking about turning transparency into trust, and comparisons into firm commitments. So, gear up, get ready to flex those presentation skills, and let&#8217;s embark on a journey of adaptation, engagement, and pure excellence.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enhancing-buyer-presentations-with-visual-aids\">Enhancing Buyer Presentations with Visual Aids</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5596\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0e82fdf1bf409532-4-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"997\" height=\"419\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-2.webp 997w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-2-300x126.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-2-768x323.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;re armed with the essentials for your buyer agent presentation, let&#8217;s talk about the next big thing: standing out in a sea of buyer agents clamoring for attention from would-be homebuyers.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to kick it up a notch and differentiate yourself with presentations that are not just compelling but downright irresistible. And guess what?</p>\n<p>Elevating your buyer presentation with some snazzy visual aids can make all the difference in captivating, informing, and winning over those potential clients. So, buckle up, because here are some fun ways to level up your presentation game and steal the spotlight!</p>\n<h3>Engaging PowerPoint Slides</h3>\n<p>Develop a series of polished, professional PowerPoint slides that encapsulate the core of your services, the buying process, and the unique value you offer. Use high-quality images, consistent branding, and clear, concise text to convey your message effectively.</p>\n<p>These slides should not only inform but also visually captivate your audience, making the complex real estate process understandable and engaging.</p>\n<h3>Infographics and Charts</h3>\n<p>Utilize infographics and charts to present data, such as market trends, pricing structures, or the benefits of using a buyer agent, in a visually appealing and easy-to-digest manner.</p>\n<p>Infographics are particularly effective in breaking down complex information into manageable, understandable pieces that can make a lasting impression.</p>\n<h3>Video Testimonials and Virtual Tours</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5598 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d80f7d889aef719a-3-3.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-3.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-3-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Embed short video testimonials from past clients or virtual tours of homes you’ve helped clients purchase. This adds credibility to your presentation and provides a dynamic and immersive experience, showcasing your success stories and the tangible outcomes of your services.</p>\n<h3>Tech-Savvy Demonstrations</h3>\n<p>Use technology to your advantage by demonstrating how you leverage the latest tools and platforms to find the best properties, negotiate deals, and streamline the buying process. Reassure clients that you’re equipped to handle their real estate needs efficiently by showing your tech-savvy approach.</p>\n<h3>Customized Handouts</h3>\n<p>Along with your digital presentation, provide customized handouts that summarize key points, offer additional insights, or list actionable steps for the clients. These takeaways can serve as a reference for clients long after the presentation, keeping you top of mind.</p>\n<p>By upgrading your buyer presentation visuals to be more engaging, informative, and visually appealing, you position yourself as a professional who is well-prepared, client-focused, and capable of delivering exceptional service. This attention to detail and commitment to quality can be a deciding factor for clients in choosing you as their agent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap!</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, if you&#8217;re a buyer agent sticking to traditional commission models in today&#8217;s rapidly evolving real estate landscape, it&#8217;s time to wake up and adapt.</p>\n<p>By embracing transparency, showcasing your unique value, and enhancing your buyer presentations with engaging visuals, you can stay ahead of the curve and thrive in this ever-changing market.</p>\n<p>So, gear up, and get ready to adapt, engage, and excel—because the future of real estate waits for no one!</p>\n<h2 id=\"learn-more-about-exp-realty-and-our-free-sponsor-team\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

The seller often covers this fee, but industry changes could shake this up</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-was-the-impact-of-a-landmark-court-loss-on-buyer-agent-commissions\">What was the impact of a landmark court loss on buyer agent commissions?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/law-and-ethics/breaking-down-sitzer-burnett\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This court case</a> was a game-changer, putting pressure on traditional commission structures and potentially reducing how much buyer agents pocket from home sales.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-department-of-justice-doj-statement-affect-buyer-agents\">How does the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2024-02/420087.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Justice (DOJ) statement</a> affect buyer agents?</h3>\n<p>The DOJ&#8217;s aims to make real estate transactions more transparent. Buyer agents will need to adapt to clearer commission disclosures and possibly tighter competition.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-do-to-prepare-for-industry-changes-as-a-buyer-agent\">What should buyer agents do to prepare for industry changes?</h3>\n<p>Stay informed and flexible. Brush up your Buyer Presentation skills. Embrace technology, enhance your negotiation skills, and consider diversifying your services. The goal? To stay valuable no matter how the market shifts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-unintended-consequences-of-payment-shifts-in-real-estate\">What are some unintended consequences of payment shifts in real estate?</h3>\n<p>Shifts towards buyer-paid commissions could lead buyers to bargain harder or skip out on using an agent altogether. It’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p>Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p>Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. Learn to clarify your value!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\">How do real estate agents typically receive their payments?</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, a home transaction closing triggers the payment to agents.  The closing statement accounts for the commission payment as part of its details.  The escrow officer sends the commission to each agent&#8217;s broker &#8211; who then disburses it to the agents after deducting for their fees (splits).</p>\n<p>Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\">What is the average income for a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p>As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. Location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full-time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\">What is the average real estate agent commission charge?</h3>\n<p>Typically, the buying and selling agents equally share the average US commission, which is generally 5% to 6% of a property’s total sale price.  These numbers vary between locations, different agents, and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\">Does an agent&#8217;s brokerage pay the entire commission to the agent?</h3>\n<p>Most likely no. Most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\">Can I negotiate my realtor’s commission rate?</h3>\n<p>Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. You should discuss the commission before signing any agreement</p>\n<p>Some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\">When do real estate agents receive their commission?</h3>\n<p>Agents receive their commissions upon the closing of deals. They do not receive any payment for their time or expenses until after the deals close. Thus, real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\">How much do real estate agents make if the house doesn’t sell?</h3>\n<p>Generally, nothing. The agent is out their time and their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\">Do brokerages pay real estate agents a salary monthly?</h3>\n<p>No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals, and they earn their pay when they successfully close a deal.  Some brokers pay agents a salary, but not generally.</p>\n",

While some of these changes have already begun to manifest, others may remain speculative. However, real estate agents who arm themselves with readiness for these possibilities are far more likely to thrive than those who do not.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced Transparency Regarding Real Estate Agent Fees</h3>\n<p>In the evolving real estate business landscape, buyers will gain clearer insights into the costs associated with purchasing a home, including understanding that the agent&#8217;s fee is currently part of the home&#8217;s price.  Buyer agent fees are not “free” and never have been.</p>\n<h3>Direct Negotiation Between Buyer Agents and Home Buyers</h3>\n<p>Because homebuyers will be aware that their agent’s fees are part of the home’s prices and that these fees are open to negotiation, homebuyers and their buyer agents will engage in more straightforward discussions, with homebuyers actively participating in negotiating the buyer agent’s fee.</p>\n<h3>More Competitive Agent Commissions Coming?</h3>\n<p>Because homebuyers may start to openly negotiate with buyer agents, the industry may see more competitive pricing.  Further, that may lead to more tailored and defined services provided by buyer agents.</p>\n<h3>Do-It-Yourself Choice for Future Homebuyers</h3>\n<p>Homebuyers will learn that their agent’s fees are not only negotiable, but their home buying options include the choice to purchase a home without an agent if they feel confident to do so.  That’s a big change!</p>\n<h3>Home Price Drops Coming?</h3>\n<p>Will home prices drop if buyer agent commissions decrease? Not likely. House prices are determined by the market, not by commission rates. Even if the traditional commission structure is altered, it’s the market dynamics that ultimately dictate pricing so home values aren’t likely to change even if commission percentages decline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-uncertain-future-of-real-estate-buyer-agents\">The Uncertain Future of Real Estate Buyer Agents?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5581\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/87532ad45e9086a5-3-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"332\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-1-300x100.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-1-768x255.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Ok, let&#8217;s delve into a pressing question that&#8217;s been on many of our minds: Will buyer agents become obsolete?</p>\n<h3>Real Estate Skills for Staying Power</h3>\n<p>Rest assured, the role of buyer&#8217;s agents is not going anywhere. Many buyers will continue to value the expertise and personalized service provided by buyer&#8217;s agents, especially because a home purchase is usually the biggest purchase a consumer will make in their lifetime, it’s risky to go it alone.</p>\n<h3>The Failure of Real Estate Disrupters</h3>\n<p>For years, there’s been a bunch of companies trying to shake things up and change who earns the real estate commission. But guess what? Most have fallen short of changing the industry and some even pivoted to join it.</p>\n<p>For example, apparently, Zillow first came on the scene with the goal of replacing real estate agents.  But Zillow quickly discovered they had a last-mile problem.  The last mile refers to – a common supply chain problem where the last mile of transporting a product is rife with logistical challenges.  Zillow discovered that an agent’s local knowledge is critical, so Zillow pivoted to selling leads to real estate buyer agents, not replacing them.</p>\n<p>On a side note, Zillow also found out the hard way that their specialized value estimates, “zestimates” don’t stack up to the actual knowledge of agents who visit local neighborhoods and homes regularly.  Relying on their zestimates and buying up homes to flip them, Zillow lost $230 million and exited the ibuying business blaming its failure on their own zestimates home value algorithms for inaccurately predicting home values.</p>\n<h3>Other Historical Disrupter Precedents</h3>\n<p>When discount stock brokerages arrived on the scene, many pundits said that would be the end of stockbrokers. It wasn’t. Similarly, when more people understood that they could represent themselves in court, that didn’t stop people from hiring lawyers to do it instead.</p>\n<p>Yes, things are changing, but that doesn’t mean that the role of buyer agents is ending, quite the opposite.</p>\n<h3>Unmatched Investment Significance of Buying Homes</h3>\n<p>Purchasing a home is often the largest investment individuals make, similar in importance to investing in the stock market or navigating the legal system. The stakes are high, and the value of a knowledgeable advocate by your side is immeasurable. The expertise of real estate buyer agents will remain in demand due to the importance of professional guidance in a major transaction.</p>\n<h3>Professional Advantages of Buyer Agent Expertise</h3>\n<p>Agents offer more than access to listings. Agent representation brings the power of negotiation, insider knowledge, and a vast network that can lead to better pricing and opportunities. Agent expertise can be the key to unlocking the best deals and avoiding overpaying.</p>\n<h3>Risk Mitigation for Homebuyers</h3>\n<p>With an agent’s guidance, buyers are less likely to encounter costly, potentially devastating, mistakes. Agents provide a wealth of local knowledge, insights into home-specific concerns, and a seasoned eye for spotting potential issues, ensuring a smoother and more secure purchasing process.</p>\n<h3>Data Overload Regarding properties</h3>\n<p>While potential buyers have more information at their fingertips than ever before, the abundance of data can be overwhelming. The high availability of property details has paradoxically increased the reliance on buyer agents. The more information there is, the more buyers seek a professional to navigate the complexities, validate the data, and clarify the path forward.</p>\n<p>In essence, the role of buyer agents is not diminishing but evolving. Our expertise, negotiation skills, and insider knowledge remain invaluable. As the landscape of real estate continues to transform, our profession stands resilient, indispensable, and more critical than ever in guiding clients through the intricate journey of purchasing their dream home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-of-real-estate-buyer-agents-how-will-they-get-paid\">Future of Real Estate Buyer Agents &#8211; How Will They Get Paid</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5582\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/80cad9ec77227f10-4-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"391\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-1-300x117.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-1-768x300.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>All right, let&#8217;s tackle the big question: If sellers cannot offer to pay buyer agent fees, what will be the new game plan for how buyer agents get paid?  Yes, we&#8217;re hitting the heart of the issue now. The future of buyer agent compensation is shifting away from being an indirect cost included in the home&#8217;s sale price.</p>\n<h3>The Department of Justice’s Vision</h3>\n<p>Let’s first start with the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) stated vision.  If you read Part 1 of our 5-Part blog series or watched our other videos then you know this whole idea of the home seller not being able to offer a buyer agent broker fee on the MLS came from the DOJ’s “Statement of Interest” in one of the many lawsuits with the same issues.</p>\n<p>And their vision regarding how buyer agents would be paid?  Well, the DOJ said it does NOT see a future where homebuyers have to dig deeper into their pockets at closing to pay their agents.  Instead, the DOJ foresees a world where homebuyers request that the home seller pay their buyer agent fees as a condition of their offer for the home.</p>\n<p>The DOJ contends that “Thus, the current practice could continue, where the seller factors the commissions into the offer the seller is willing to accept.” So, even with all the legal ramifications, in the end, the home seller may still pay for the buyer’s agent.</p>\n<p>Sounds great for home buyers, right? Well, maybe, it’s all just math.  For example, if a seller gets an offer for $1,000,000 and the buyer asks for $25,000 to be paid to their agent and the seller gets another offer that doesn’t ask for anything to be paid to their agent yet their offer is $974,000, then the first offer is still better.</p>\n<p>However, homebuyers often feel anchored to the listing price request.  Therefore, if two homebuyers offer list price from the home and only one adds the condition of the buyer’s agent fee, the homebuyer without that request will win the home every time.</p>\n<p>Here are two other options for how future real estate buyer agents may be paid:</p>\n<h3>Direct Payment from Homebuyers</h3>\n<p>The straightforward route is that homebuyers would pay their agents directly when they purchase a home. In that event, buyer agent fees would become just another closing cost. Closing costs are customarily paid on top of the purchase price – costs like escrow fees, title insurance, lender fees, and property taxes could then also include buyer agent fees.</p>\n<p>But note, if buyer agent fees are paid as a part of closing costs, there will need to be a change in how home purchases are financed. Lender rules will need to allow buyer agent fees to be part of mortgage financing. But how hard could that change be? Lenders already pay for buyer agent fees because they are currently part of the home price.</p>\n<h3>Seller Concessions Directly For Homebuyers</h3>\n<p>Another possibility is that home sellers may end up offering to pay buyer agent fees much like how sellers can offer to credit homebuyers some stipend to pay for new carpet or they may offer to pay down a buyer’s loan.</p>\n<p>Note, it doesn’t seem that any new law could prevent home sellers from making this type of concession. It is different than the traditional method of a seller paying the listing agent 5 or 6% and then the listing agent pays the buyer agent broker.  In this case, the buyer agent fee offer would be between the home seller and the homebuyer, not the seller and their listing agent.</p>\n<p>However, suppose all home sellers make this concession because their listing agent tells them to. In that case, the results might undo any benefit to homebuyers that the DOJ believes would otherwise occur from preventing sellers from making buyer agent offers through their listing agent agreement.</p>\n<p>Still, seller concessions to buyers would be under their own terms. Home sellers might offer a percentage of the sale or a flat fee to a buyer’s agent. And, if the fee doesn’t match what the buyer agent and homebuyer have agreed on, the homebuyer would still need to make up any difference with a direct payment to the buyer’s agent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-the-business-of-buyer-agents-may-evolve\">How the Future of Real Estate Buyer Agents’ Business Model May Evolve</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5583\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9f0f02d6ea1a721e-5-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"319\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-1-300x96.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-1-768x245.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>If the DOJ’s statement is adopted by the courts, then the landscape for buyer agents could evolve to something new and different. Here&#8217;s what we could see:</p>\n<h3>Buyer Agent and Homebuyer Fee Negotiations</h3>\n<p>Under the new DOJ proposal, buyer agents will need to negotiate their fees. The DOJ anticipates that if agents need to justify their worth directly to the buyers who are footing the bill, they will compete for the business which may put downward pressure on customary buyer agent commission rates.</p>\n<h3>Buyer Agent Experience Will Matter More</h3>\n<p>If buyer agents are not all offered the same compensation from an MLS listing as they are now, this payment structure of all agents being offered the same commission rate irrespective of their experience or knowledge could shift.</p>\n<p>Buyer agent compensation could shift to more closely reflecting an agent&#8217;s experience and expertise. Seasoned agents might command higher fees, while newcomers may need to lower their rates or collaborate with experienced colleagues to bolster their value proposition.</p>\n<h3>More Niche Specialization</h3>\n<p>Although always a good idea for agents, even more agents may be attracted to offering niche specialization. Those agents could then justify their fees by specializing in particular market segments, offering unparalleled expertise in specific areas.</p>\n<h3>Industry Shakeup May Cause Real Estate Buyer Agents to Quit</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5584 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0ea60f922077434a-Small-Blog-Images.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Small-Blog-Images.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Small-Blog-Images-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>The move to more variable commissions and the need to justify agent value may squeeze some agents out of the business, especially those wedded to the traditional models. However, this might mean a less crowded field for those buyer agents who adapt, potentially leading to more business for the adaptable agents.</p>\n<h3>Rethinking Agent Roles &#038; the Skills Needed for Success</h3>\n<p>Buyer agents will likely need to become adept at conducting buyer consultations, thoroughly explaining the buying process and their unique value. Buyer agents also may end up offering tiered pricing for different levels of service or commitment.</p>\n<h3>Innovative Pricing Models</h3>\n<p>We might see agents experimenting with new pricing strategies, such as flat fees, hourly rates, or a la carte service menus, allowing homebuyers to tailor the services to their needs and budgets.</p>\n<p>In any event on exactly how the court cases are resolved, these shifts in the real estate industry suggest a future where buyer agents must clearly communicate their value and adapt to a marketplace where homebuyers have greater influence over the terms of agent compensation.</p>\n<p>This could lead to a more transparent, customer-focused industry that rewards agents who can effectively demonstrate their worth and adapt to the evolving real estate landscape.</p>\n<p>If you’re unsure how to explain your value and the best ways to do it, we have that information coming up in Part 3 &#038; 4 of this blog series.

The shift in how agents are compensated and perceived is likely to enlighten more people about the true value of an agent&#8217;s role, which extends far beyond merely opening doors and showing properties. This heightened appreciation would stem from a better public understanding of the nuanced, multifaceted nature of hard-working buyer agents.</p>\n<h3>Appreciation of Real Estate Agent Investments</h3>\n<p>Along with agents describing their value to homebuyers, buyers could come to know that agents make significant investments in their profession.</p>\n<p>Agents cover all their own operational expenses, pay their broker and referral partners significant portions of their commission, all with the high-stakes risk of earning no income without successful deals.</p>\n<p>When the public comes to understand that agents make significant personal investments to provide value with no guaranteed pay, this could foster greater respect for agents as the public gains insight into the financial and emotional stakes involved in the real estate profession.</p>\n<h3>Potential for Direct Compensation for Time Invested</h3>\n<p>The changing landscape might open doors for real estate buyer agents to be compensated for their time, irrespective of the transaction outcome. This potential paradigm shift means agents could explore billing models that ensure they are paid for the professional services they provide, much like consultants in other fields.</p>\n<h3>Enhancement of Professional Standards in Real Estate Agents</h3>\n<p>As the industry demands more transparency and value demonstration, it&#8217;s likely that the market will naturally filter out agents who cannot articulate or deliver on their value proposition. This could result in a professional environment populated by highly skilled, value-driven agents, elevating the overall quality and reputation of the profession.</p>\n<p>In essence, these transformations could lead to a more respected, value-oriented profession where buyer agents are acknowledged not just for the deals they close but for the comprehensive, expert service they provide to their clients. This shift promises to not only enhance the perception of buyer agents but also to cultivate a marketplace where true professional merit is the cornerstone of success. And that’s all good!</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>Our journey through the changing landscape of real estate has shed light on the potential transformations ahead, particularly in how buyer agents are compensated. From enhanced transparency to direct negotiation between agents and homebuyers, the future holds both challenges and opportunities for the industry.</p>\n<p>Yet, amidst these shifts, one thing remains clear: the enduring value of buyer agents in guiding clients through the intricate process of purchasing a home. As the profession adapts and evolves, it&#8217;s poised to emerge stronger, more respected, and more client-focused than ever before, ushering in a new era of professionalism and transparency in real estate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"join-our-free-group-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty – the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em> profitable publicly traded brokerage</a> over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Brush up your Buyer Presentation skills. Embrace technology, enhance your negotiation skills, and consider diversifying your services. The goal? To stay valuable no matter how the market shifts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-unintended-consequences-of-payment-shifts-in-real-estate\">What are some unintended consequences of payment shifts in real estate?</h3>\n<p>Shifts towards buyer-paid commissions could lead buyers to bargain harder or skip out on using an agent altogether. It’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p>Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p>Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. Also, lean into marketing yourself digitally; it’s where the eyeballs are at!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\">How Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid?</h3>\n<p>Traditionally an agent doesn’t get paid until a home is sold. The commission payment is accounted for as a part of the closing statement. Each agent’s broker &#8211; for the buyer agent and the seller agent &#8211; is sent the commission for disbursement to the agents after the broker deduct their split. Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\">What is the Average Income for a Real Estate Agent?</h3>\n<p>As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. Location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\">What is the Average Real Estate Agent Commission Charge?</h3>\n<p>The average commission in the US is 5.5% of a property’s total sale price and is usually evenly split between the buying and selling agents. These numbers vary between location, different agents and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\">Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid the Entire Commission?</h3>\n<p>Most likely no. Most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\">Can I Negotiate My Realtor’s Commission Rate?</h3>\n<p>Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. The commission should be discussed before signing any agreement.</p>\n<p>Some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\">When do Real Estate Agents get Paid Their Commission?</h3>\n<p>Agents get paid when deals close. They are not paid anything for their time or expenses before that. Thus, real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\">How Much Do Real Estate Agents Make if the House Doesn’t Sell?</h3>\n<p>Generally, nothing. The agent is out their time and their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\">Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid Monthly?</h3>\n<p>No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals. There are a couple of brokers that pay agents a salary, but it’s not the general way it’s done.</p>\n",

How has the real estate business already changed in the last decade or two?</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-digital-shift-in-the-real-estate-industry\">The Digital Shift in the Real Estate Industry</h3>\n<p>Before the internet brought us online platforms like Zillow.com and Realtor.com, buyer agents were the sole gatekeepers of the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS), the magical vault where all potential homes for sale were listed.</p>\n<p>As such it was buyer agents who conjured up home suggestions, orchestrated viewings, and guided buyers through the mystical world of real estate. Fast forward to today, and a staggering 90% of homebuyers start their quest online and many continue to use those platforms to be notified of new homes for sale that may interest them.</p>\n<p>Thus, the digital revolution has democratized access to real estate listings and made it easy for everyone to know what homes are for sale with the exclusion of off-market listings which are still only known to agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-perception-of-real-estate-agents-suffers\">Public Perception of Real Estate Agents Suffers</h3>\n<p>This seismic shift in knowledge about homes for sale ushered in a wave of public skepticism. The pervasive belief now is that agents might not be the champions of value they once were, given that buyers can easily see what homes are for sale and when those homes will have an open house for the public.</p>\n<p>The skepticism has rebirthed older concerns as well like the thought that agents are not incentivized to bargain hard for their clients because agents earn a percentage of the sale price of a home.</p>\n<p>However, any seasoned agent knows this narrative misses the mark entirely. The truth is, the slight variance in commission from negotiating down is minuscule compared to the paramount importance of closing the deal—securing that essential paycheck and covering the myriad costs already invested in the client.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s a bigger picture — the long game. Exceptional service today means repeat business tomorrow and a stream of referrals, and agents need these to have a thriving real estate career.</p>\n<p>Why would any agent jeopardize future referrals for a tiny bit more dough? Agents are in it for the long haul, deeply invested in their client’s satisfaction and their professional reputation, both of which are critical for sustained success in the ever-evolving world of real estate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"public-perception-results-in-criticism\">Public Perception Results in Criticism</h3>\n<p>However, here we are, the real estate waters are getting choppy with numerous lawsuits challenging the traditional commission structure. These legal disputes are rooted in a widespread public perception that real estate agents are paid too much.</p>\n<p>In recent years, a significant number of lawsuits have emerged, all targeting the established norms of how real estate commissions are determined and disbursed.  Let’s talk about how commissions are generally determined and disbursed right now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-how-buyer-agents-are-paid-how-commissions-have-worked\">Understanding How Buyer Agents Are Paid &#8211; How Commissions have worked</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5377\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/adf4949664a3372e-3.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"448\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-300x134.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3-768x344.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Traditionally, when it comes to real estate transactions, it&#8217;s the home sellers who&#8217;ve been picking up the tab for the commissions of both buyer and seller agents. This has been the case for the last 100 years.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it rolls out: The seller negotiates and signs an agreement to pay their listing agent some set percentage of the sale. The seller knows that the seller’s total percentage will include some agreed-upon percentage for the buyer’s agent as well.</p>\n<p>When a property sells, the listing agent’s brokerage then shares a portion of this commission with the buyer’s agent.</p>\n<p>Why does this system make sense?  Because with an offer of compensation for buyer agents, the selling agent ignites all the buyer agents, or let&#8217;s call them the worker bees, to sell the home. These bees buzz around opening doors and showing properties, all while being safeguarded by their brokerage’s liability insurance to ensure the homes are safe.</p>\n<p>Now, dive into the world of the Multiple Listing Service, or MLS, where the plot thickens. There, buyer agents are offered a percentage of the sale – a percentage that can and does vary from property to property.</p>\n<p>However, once listed in the MLS, an offer of buyer agent compensation is a binding promise, creating an obligation that the buyer’s agent will get paid despite that the buyer’s agent is not a party to the contract between the seller and the seller agent’s brokerage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lawsuits-aiming-to-change-the-status-quo\">Lawsuits Aiming to Change the Status Quo</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5378\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ac9daa55f94d7f39-4.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"420\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-300x126.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-768x323.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>There is currently a flurry of lawsuits challenging the traditional framework of agent commissions, particularly focusing on the practice where sellers bear the cost of buyer agent fees.</p>\n<p>These legal challenges allege that such arrangements unjustly inflate commission costs, and they accuse various industry players, including brokerages, realtor associations, and multiple listing services (MLSs), of colluding to enforce these fee structures, potentially breaching federal antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>The spotlight recently turned to the landmark Sitzer/Burnett trial in Kansas City, a case that sent ripples throughout the real estate industry. The trial concluded with a groundbreaking verdict against the National Association of Realtors (NAR), finding them culpable of conspiring to inflate agent commissions.</p>\n<p>This verdict wasn&#8217;t just another legal decision; it was monumental, marking the first instance where such a case concluded with a staggering $1.8 billion in damages awarded.</p>\n<p>While the direct impact of this case is localized to the participants in Missouri, its implications are far-reaching. That’s because this landmark judgment is causing a wave of similar copycat lawsuits to pop up nationwide igniting a national reevaluation of how real estate commissions are structured and challenging the status quo of how brokerages and their agents are paid for the services they provide.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-brokerages-agreed-to-do-to-end-the-cases\">What Brokerages Agreed to Do to End The Cases</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5379\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/efbd51d8a940965a-5.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"356\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-300x107.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/5-768x273.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>To solve the issues at hand, real estate players (associations, brokerage, and MLSs) have agreed to change their process, including removing any requirement that a seller must offer the buyer’s agent brokerage any compensation.</p>\n<p>In the Nosalek case against an MLS, the MLS agrees to lower the minimum offer from the seller’s agent from 1 cent to $0.</p>\n<p>So the players in these cases agree that sellers no longer need to offer buyer agents any offer of compensation and that the MLS involved will allow listing agents to fill out the field regarding a buyer agent’s brokerage compensation with a zero.</p>\n<p>As similar lawsuits proliferate across the United States, it seems likely that these cases may set a new real estate standard for how real estate agents are paid.</p>\n<p>But wait, what has happened in the courtrooms is not the biggest problem for buyer agents!</p>\n<h2 id=\"sellers-no-longer-to-pay-buyer-agent\">Sellers No Longer to Pay Buyer Agent?</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5380\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/8951c0a55250a410-6.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"995\" height=\"427\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6.webp 995w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-300x129.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/6-768x330.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 995px) 100vw, 995px\" /></p>\n<p>The biggest problem stems from an opinion written to the judge of a case. The Department of Justice (DOJ) stepped into the spotlight in the Nosalek case by entering a <strong>“Statement of Interest”</strong> regarding the case’s proposed settlement.  By the way, the DOJ is not a party in this lawsuit, but this statement is allowed under US law, <strong>28 U.S.C. § 517</strong>.</p>\n<p>In that statement of interest, the DOJ urged the court to <strong>reject the proposed settlements</strong> and to instead <strong>require that sellers not be allowed to make any offer of compensation</strong> to buyer agent brokerages.</p>\n<p>Why?  The DOJ argues that allowing sellers to offer any buyer agent broker commissions perpetuates a system where seller agents might pressure their clients into maintaining &#8220;customary&#8221; commission offers.</p>\n<p>This pressure is driven by a seller agent’s concern that offering anything lower than the customary amount might lead buyer agents into “steering” (an illegal practice) their clients towards listings with higher offers of commission.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the DOJ argues that as long as the door is open for sellers to offer buyer agent commission fees, there&#8217;s a risk that the status quo will remain unchallenged upholding business as usual, and nothing really changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-real-estate-buyer-agents\">The Future of Real Estate Buyer Agents</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5381\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/bb4cc1f2049d117f-7.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"406\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7-300x122.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7-768x312.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>And there we are at the crux of the matter.  If the court adopts the DOJ’s proposal and then courts across the nation also adopt that court’s decision – which is very likely as that is how case law is made and can grow everywhere &#8211; then we see that this one court’s decision will have far-reaching consequences.</p>\n<p>Sellers will no longer be allowed to make an offer of compensation to buyer agent brokerages and MLSs will no longer have a field that creates an obligation for the buyer agent to be paid for their services.</p>\n<p>Does that mean buyer agents will cease to exist or that they won’t get paid moving forward?  Of course not!</p>\n<p>We have more blogs coming out about this significant shift in the buyer agent business, what may occur, and how to handle it, so drop us an email with the subject line “newsletter” and we’ll add you to the list to be notified when our next blog drops.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That’s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>The real estate landscape is undergoing a seismic shift as court cases challenge the traditional norms of commission payments.

This fee is often covered by the seller, but industry changes could shake this up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-was-the-impact-of-a-landmark-court-loss-on-buyer-agent-commissions\">What was the impact of a landmark court loss on buyer agent commissions?</h3>\n<p>This court case was a game-changer, putting pressure on traditional commission structures and potentially reducing how much buyer agents pocket from home sales.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-department-of-justice-doj-statement-affect-buyer-agents\">How does the Department of Justice (DOJ) statement affect buyer agents?</h3>\n<p>The DOJ&#8217;s aims to make real estate transactions more transparent. For buyer agents, this means adapting to clearer commission disclosures and possibly tighter competition as a result of the method the DOJ hopes to make the new law of the land, namely that sellers not be allowed to make an offer of compensation to buyer agents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-i-do-to-prepare-for-industry-changes-as-a-buyer-agent\">What should I do to prepare for industry changes as a buyer agent?</h3>\n<p>Stay informed and flexible. Brush up your Buyer Presentation skills. Embrace technology, enhance your negotiation skills, and consider diversifying your services. The goal? To stay valuable no matter how the market shifts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-unintended-consequences-of-payment-shifts-in-real-estate\">What are some unintended consequences of payment shifts in real estate?</h3>\n<p>Shifts towards buyer-paid commissions could lead buyers to bargain harder or skip out on using an agent altogether. It’s like opening Pandora&#8217;s box &#8211; unpredictable but inevitable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-are-brokerages-adjusting-to-buyer-paid-commissions\">How are brokerages adjusting to buyer-paid commissions?</h3>\n<p>Many brokerages are rethinking their business models—some by offering flat fees or reduced rates—to align with changing expectations while still attracting clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-share-strategies-for-adapting-to-new-commission-models-as-a-real-estate-agent\">Can you share strategies for adapting to new commission models as a real estate agent?</h3>\n<p>Sure thing! Focus on building strong client relationships and proving your worth beyond finding listings—think consultation and negotiation expertise. Also, lean into marketing yourself digitally; it’s where the eyeballs are at!</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid\">How Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid?</h3>\n<p>Traditionally an agent doesn’t get paid until a home is sold. The commission payment is accounted for as a part of the closing statement. Each agent’s broker &#8211; for the buyer agent and the seller agent &#8211; is sent the commission for disbursement to the agents after the broker deduct their split. Some agents receive their commission directly from escrow and escrow sends only the split to the agent’s broker.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-income-for-a-real-estate-agent\">What is the Average Income for a Real Estate Agent?</h3>\n<p>As of February 2024, the average salary for a real estate agent is $46,014, down from the previous year’s figure of $46,014. Location affects what an agent will make as well as whether they are full time, an agent’s experience, connections, specialty and seniority.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-average-real-estate-agent-commission-charge\">What is the Average Real Estate Agent Commission Charge?</h3>\n<p>The average commission in the US is 5.5% of a property’s total sale price and is usually evenly split between the buying and selling agents. These numbers vary between location, different agents and market conditions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-the-entire-commission\">Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid the Entire Commission?</h3>\n<p>Most likely no. Most realtors work with a brokerage and some also work with referral partners. Agents will owe a substantial portion of their commissions to those parties.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-negotiate-my-realtors-commission-rate\">Can I Negotiate My Realtor’s Commission Rate?</h3>\n<p>Yes, home sellers and homebuyers can negotiate with their agents to work out the best commission rate. The commission should be discussed before signing any agreement.</p>\n<p>Some agents gladly negotiate commissions while others may not. More experienced agents are less likely to negotiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"when-do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-their-commission\">When do Real Estate Agents get Paid Their Commission?</h3>\n<p>Agents get paid when deals close. They are not paid anything for their time or expenses before that. Thus, real estate agents are similar to lawyers who work on contingency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-much-do-real-estate-agents-make-if-the-house-doesnt-sell\">How Much Do Real Estate Agents Make if the House Doesn’t Sell?</h3>\n<p>Generally, nothing. The agent is out their time and their expenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-real-estate-agents-get-paid-monthly\">Do Real Estate Agents Get Paid Monthly?</h3>\n<p>No. Real estate agents receive no income outside of closing deals. There are a couple of brokers that pay agents a salary, but it’s not the general way it’s done.</p>\n",

The more views your videos get, the more favorably YouTube&#8217;s algorithm assesses your content, leading to increased visibility.</p>\n<p>This enhanced exposure is invaluable for real estate agents, as it significantly expands your potential client base by placing your content in front of individuals actively seeking real estate advice and insights on YouTube.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unlocking-youtube-success-for-real-estate-agents\">Unlocking YouTube Success for Real Estate Agents</h2>\n<p>Before we jump into the <strong>7 game-changing tips</strong>, take note that the goal isn&#8217;t just to rack up views on YouTube; it&#8217;s about attracting the right eyes.  You want to attract potential buyers and sellers who are <strong>genuinely interested in what you offer</strong>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not about casting the widest net.  It’s about casting the most precise one. A mountain of views means little if they don&#8217;t translate into clients knocking on your door, ready to dive into the real estate journey with you.</p>\n<p>Also, don&#8217;t let a modest view count dampen your spirits. It&#8217;s a little-known secret that in the realm of real estate YouTube stardom, it&#8217;s quality over quantity. A hundred views or even 50 views from the right audience can fill your calendar faster than thousands of casual browsers ever could.</p>\n<p>Therefore, remember to always focus on content that resonates with your ideal clients. You are looking for clients who work with you. Huge views from everyone else will stroke your ego but not your bank account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"directing-traffic-to-videos-with-cards-and-end-screens\">Directing Traffic to Videos with Cards and End Screens</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4575\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/224391855392edb1-More-Views.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"405\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-300x122.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-768x311.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>To encourage your audience to explore more content on your channel, thereby increasing your views, be sure to use YouTube’s cards and end screens. These features are visible for you to choose when uploading your video.  You can also go back and edit your video details to include cards and end screens later.</p>\n<p>Cards serve as interactive prompts, guiding viewers to additional related content. For maximum impact, mention the related video in your video script and point to the corner where the card will be showing.  If a viewer clicks on the card, they are transported to your other video.</p>\n<p>End screens also provide links to up to four of your other videos. For maximum impact, choose end-screen videos with similar content and also mention these videos in your video script at the same time the end screens are showing.</p>\n<p>This creates a seamless flow of content, making viewers more inclined to continue watching and bringing you in more YouTube views.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maximizing-views-through-engagement\">Maximizing Views through Engagement</h2>\n<p>Now let’s jump into the right way to get more YouTube views for real estate agents. Face it, the YouTube algorithm loves it when creators interact with their viewer communities. Let&#8217;s dive into the most dynamic strategies for engaging with your audience in ways that really count.</p>\n<p><strong>Fast, Personalized Responses</strong></p>\n<p>The heart of viewer engagement lies in the connection. Quickly responding to comments on your videos isn&#8217;t just polite; it&#8217;s a powerful way to show you genuinely value your audience&#8217;s thoughts and time.</p>\n<p>Engaging in meaningful conversations by answering their questions builds a trust bridge and also makes your viewers feel valued and seen. This warmth and acknowledgment from you will increase the likelihood of the viewer returning for more insights, advice, or simply to see what you&#8217;ll share next, netting you more YouTube views overall.</p>\n<p><strong>Engage Through Interactive Content</strong></p>\n<p>Transform your viewers into active participants with the magic of interactive content. Utilize the community tab to launch polls asking for their input on future video topics. It&#8217;s like inviting them into your creative process, making them feel invested in the content that&#8217;s yet to come.</p>\n<p>Also, don&#8217;t overlook the power of surveys to collect feedback on your existing content. This treasure trove of insights is your secret weapon for tailoring your content strategy to better meet your audience&#8217;s preferences and expectations and bring you more YouTube views.</p>\n<p><strong>Excite with Fun Giveaways</strong></p>\n<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love a good giveaway? Hosting contests with prizes related to real estate – whether it’s insightful guides, one-on-one consultations, or stylish home decor items -injects a dose of excitement into your channel.</p>\n<p>These giveaways do more than just reward your viewers; they foster a sense of community and encourage viewers to share your channel within their networks, amplifying your reach, bringing you more YouTube views, and drawing in more potential clients excited about real estate and what you have to offer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"promoting-your-channel-for-more-views\">Promoting Your Channel for More Views</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4576\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/e5a2db291f10a58c-More-Views-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"428\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-2-300x128.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-2-768x329.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s explore two strategies for you to directly promote your YouTube channel, providing more YouTube views for real estate agents and also attracting more clients, which is your ultimate goal!</p>\n<h3 id=\"mastering-social-sharing\"><strong>Mastering Social Sharing</strong></h3>\n<p>Promote your videos by unlocking the power of social sharing &#8211; catapulting your videos into the spotlight. Add video links prominently on your real estate website.  Picture your website homepage as a welcoming front porch, inviting visitors to step in and explore your YouTube channel too.</p>\n<p>Additionally, add video links across all your social media profiles, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok so that you can tap into the unique audience that each platform has to bring in more YouTube views.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revitalizing-email-newsletters\"><strong>Revitalizing Email Newsletters</strong></h3>\n<p>You can bring in more YouTube views by promoting your videos with an email newsletter.</p>\n<h4 id=\"real-estate-agents-that-already-have-a-newsletter\">Real Estate Agents that Already Have a Newsletter</h4>\n<p>If you’re already providing a monthly newsletter to prospects, that’s awesome!  Use your YouTube thumbnails in your newsletter as the allure of visuals helps to captivate your audience&#8217;s potential interest far beyond words alone. After you’ve added a thumbnail, create a hyperlink to your YouTube video.</p>\n<h4 id=\"real-estate-agents-without-a-newsletter\">Real Estate Agents Without a Newsletter</h4>\n<p>If you aren’t currently doing a <a href=\"/the-ultimate-guide-to-crafting-a-real-estate-agent-newsletter\">real estate newsletter</a>, it’s time to start one. Think of email newsletters as your secret weapon in the digital era. Kick off your newsletter with a compelling subject line that compels readers to look at your information.</p>\n<p>Next, craft a message that provides value to your readers – like some up-to-date real estate statistics for your location.  Last, add your thumbnail and link to promote your most recent YouTube video.</p>\n<h2 id=\"promoting-your-channel-by-repurposing-content-for-real-estate-youtube-marketing\">Promoting Your Channel by Repurposing Content for Real Estate YouTube Marketing</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4577\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/aee41fb811e82cd9-More-Views-3.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"391\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-3.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-3-300x117.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/More-Views-3-768x300.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Repurposing content offers another avenue for self-promoting your YouTube videos bringing in more YouTube views for real estate agents.  However, it’s a bit more complicated than the self-promotion strategies we already discussed so it deserves its own segment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revitalizing-blogs-into-videos\"><strong>Revitalizing Blogs into Videos</strong></h3>\n<p>The first strategy is to breathe life into your written content by repurposing your blog posts into videos.  This is a brilliant strategy! This approach rejuvenates your existing material and also provides a dynamic way to showcase the videos that you create from the blog.</p>\n<p>Add to each blog a sentence like: “If you’d prefer to see an entertaining video on this information, click here.” Hyperlink your video there.</p>\n<p>Start this endeavor by selecting your most engaging blog posts, those that are proven favorites among your audience.  Rewrite the blog article to make it appropriate as a YouTube script and then film it.</p>\n<p>Edit and post like any other video but this one has potentially another source of viewers – those being directed to it from your blog.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blogs-a-new-life-for-video-content\"><strong>Blogs: A New Life for Video Content</strong></h3>\n<p>Inverting the blogs into video process, turning video content into blog posts, opens up another dimension of potential views for your YouTube videos.</p>\n<p>This method repurposes your video scripts into written content, expanding your reach to those who prefer reading or may have found you through search engines.</p>\n<p>This dual approach not only diversifies your content but also amplifies your online presence, drawing in a broader audience, providing more YouTube views, and potentially increasing your client base.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leveraging-testimonials\"><strong>Leveraging Testimonials</strong></h3>\n<p>A powerful strategy for repurposing existing content involves transforming your written client testimonials into engaging social media content and captivating short-form videos. This not only showcases real success stories but also strategically directs your audience to your YouTube channel for more YouTube views.</p>\n<p>To create visually stunning posts, utilize tools like <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva.com&#8217;</a>s free version, which allows you to design eye-catching graphics effortlessly. Then, elevate these posts into dynamic short-form videos by animating the text and incorporating appealing audio tracks from Canva&#8217;s library.</p>\n<p>This dual approach amplifies your YouTube channel&#8217;s visibility, providing you with more YouTube views by leveraging the power of authentic testimonials.</p>\n<h3 id=\"short-form-video-social-media-teasers\"><strong>Short-Form Video Social Media Teasers</strong></h3>\n<p>This is the most important thing you can do to repurpose content that you’ve already taken the time, energy, and expense to make.  Transform your long-form YouTube videos into captivating snippets for social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok.  Although this may sound overwhelming, it doesn’t have to be complicated.</p>\n<p>You can repurpose long-form video content yourself by further editing your YouTube videos or you can pay for one of the many available online a.i. programs that will do the editing for you like those from Opus Clip or Veed.io</p>\n<p>If you do your own editing, change the aspect ratio to 9 x16 (1080 pixels wide by 1920 pixels tall) and cut your videos into 45 – 55 second snippets.  Add a cover to each snippet that tells the viewer what the short video is about and write a description that entices viewers to watch.</p>\n<p>End each snippet with a call to action like “see the rest of this video here” with your YouTube channel name and the name of the video.</p>\n<p>Aim for each short video length to be under 1 minute.  While some platforms allow short videos up to 3 minutes in length, they all allow 1 minute. This makes your time more efficient as you can then post across all platforms with ease.</p>\n<p>If posting across all platforms also sounds overwhelming, use a scheduling tool like Later.com where you can easily schedule your short videos across Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube.  Later.com even helps you write a compelling description and add some appropriate hashtags.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-youtube-views-by-capturing-the-magic-of-youtube-shorts\">More YouTube Views by Capturing the Magic of YouTube Shorts</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4578\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/657960e00819a4b1-Views-4.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"398\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Views-4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Views-4-300x119.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Views-4-768x306.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>There is an extraordinary use of short-form video on YouTube that you don’t want to miss. This is a Ninja trick! That is, real estate agents can effectively funnel viewers from their short-form YouTube videos to their long-form content with a simple yet strategic addition.</p>\n<p>When finalizing the details of a YouTube short video, you can select a related long-form video to recommend. This clever feature adds a clickable play button at the bottom of the short-form video. That play button serves as a direct portal to your longer content gaining you more YouTube views.</p>\n<p>Additionally, by carefully choosing related videos that complement or expand upon the short&#8217;s topic, you will enhance the viewer&#8217;s learning experience. Thus, this feature can significantly increase the chances of keeping your audience on your channel as they watch more videos providing you again with more YouTube views.</p>\n<p>This seamless transition from a quick glimpse to an in-depth exploration is HUGE for adding more YouTube views!</p>\n<h2 id=\"collaborating-to-create-more-youtube-views\">Collaborating to Create More YouTube Views</h2>\n<p>Unlock the dynamic potential of collaboration to both make your YouTube content more valuable to your audience and bring in more YouTube views. Actively seek partnerships with professionals, such as lenders, escrow officers, and contractors.</p>\n<p>Agree with these partners that you will promote their content and they will promote yours.

Let’s go over some of those advantages.</p>\n<h3 id=\"free\">Free</h3>\n<p>First off, let&#8217;s talk about everyone&#8217;s favorite word: <strong>FREE.</strong> That&#8217;s right, from Facebook to LinkedIn, social media marketing for real estate agents can be accessed on these platforms without costing you a single dime and they offer access to a vast pool of potential clients.</p>\n<p>Now that doesn’t mean you won’t want to spend some money with it by maybe hiring an editor or buying some ads, but the bottom line, social media marketing for real estate agents can be successfully done for free.</p>\n<h3 id=\"know-like-and-trust-factor\">Know, Like &#038; Trust Factor</h3>\n<p>One compelling advantage of social media for real estate agents lies in its remarkable <strong>efficiency and effectiveness</strong>. That is, as potential buyers and sellers scroll through your awesome content, they’re not just learning about your business!</p>\n<p>Those viewers are also naturally getting to know you, liking your vibe, and trusting your expertise. In other words, they are getting to know, like, and trust you.</p>\n<p>This know, like, and trust principle is a key marketing concept that suggests people are more inclined to work with those they feel connected to. Building those factors with your social media paves the way for seamless conversions from curious browsers to loyal clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attracts-clients-not-leads\">Attracts Clients, Not Leads</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4275 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/5b49d6284f51b452-Success.webp/public\" alt=\"A new real estate agent joyfully shaking hands with clients, celebrating a successful deal.\" width=\"447\" height=\"255\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Success-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" /></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the <strong>HUGE advantage</strong> of social media marketing for real estate agents: it&#8217;s not merely about collecting leads—it&#8217;s about seamlessly snagging clients.</p>\n<p>Think of it this way: Traditional marketing can feel like running a marathon with a backpack full of bricks—it’s exhaustive, requiring years of nurturing before a lead finally becomes a client, often draining both your time and money along the way.</p>\n<p>But social media? That offers a <strong>shortcut path</strong> without the bricks. When someone reaches out to you, they&#8217;re already past the window-shopping phase. They&#8217;re not just another name in your lead list; they&#8217;re a prospective client ready to take the next step.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the power of social media for real estate agents. Your content is more than just attractive visuals and clever captions; it&#8217;s actively warming up potential clients for you.</p>\n<p>It transforms the traditional, slow conversion process into a more streamlined and effective journey, making it easier for you to convert leads into real, committed clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"works-247\">Works 24/7</h3>\n<p>Hold on, it gets even juicier! Social media marketing for real estate agents is like your <strong>own personal</strong> assistant that never clocks out.</p>\n<p>Picture this: you&#8217;re tucked in for the night or hitting the gym to shake off the day&#8217;s stress, and meanwhile, your social media is out there hustling for you, around the clock. Potential clients are scrolling, engaging, and getting to know the real you, building that essential trust—even while you&#8217;re catching Z&#8217;s or lifting weights.</p>\n<p>By the time you&#8217;re sipping your morning coffee, your inbox could be buzzing with messages from clients who found themselves hooked on your content in the wee hours. Now, if that&#8217;s not the epitome of working smarter, not harder, I don&#8217;t know what is!</p>\n<h3 id=\"brand-building\">Brand Building</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4148 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/dca0adb442b1cc2c-3-2.webp/public\" alt=\"Hand presenting a star-branded badge and an information icon, depicting the importance of personal branding and detailed property information in real estate.\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-2.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-2-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>Nailing down a rock-solid brand presence is key to building trust and credibility in the client-agent world.

Thanks to your savvy social media marketing for real estate agents, you&#8217;ve got the eyes of hundreds, maybe even thousands, of eager onlookers from around the block and across the globe, all captivated by what you&#8217;ve showcased.

It&#8217;s like being the friendly neighbor who&#8217;s always waving hello, sparking conversations, and reminding them why they loved working with you in the first place.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cost-effective-marketing\">Cost-Effective Marketing</h3>\n<p>Last but not least &#8211; as I already mentioned, social media marketing for real estate agents can be done for free. While you can totally dominate the game without spending a dime, why not sprinkle a little budget magic for that extra sparkle?</p>\n<p>Think of social media ads as your budget-friendly marketing strategy, catapulting your reach far beyond traditional methods, all without the HUGE expense of traditional methods.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the wizardry of precise targeting options, you can zero in on your dream audience with greater accuracy. Minimizing waste and maximizing impact, social media ads are the secret sauce to boosting your visibility and drawing in clients like a magnet—all on a budget that keeps your wallet happy!</p>\n<h2 id=\"choosing-the-most-popular-social-media-platforms-for-real-estate-agents\">Choosing the Most Popular Social Media Platforms for Real Estate Agents</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4619\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ebe8c2ed8899778c-3-7.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"197\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-7.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-7-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-7-768x151.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Diving into social media marketing for real estate agents is like stepping into a playground of possibilities.

Skyrocket Your Visibility</strong></h3>\n<p>Think of YouTube as the VIP room of the internet&#8217;s party, where Google is the host. By setting up shop on YouTube, you&#8217;re not just getting a corner table; you&#8217;re getting the spotlight. Here&#8217;s the kicker: everything you upload gets a chance to shine on Google&#8217;s search results too.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s like hitting two birds with one stone — or better yet, catching the eyes of potential clients on both the world&#8217;s top search engine and its second-in-command, YouTube. With over 2 billion logged-in users each month, the exposure is massive.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve got two powerful streams funneling attention to your channel: people typing away on Google and the YouTube crowd. For realtors, this means your property tours, buying tips, and market insights have the potential to be seen by an audience as BIG as the housing market itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-expand-your-reach-break-borders\"><strong>3. Expand Your Reach, Break Borders</strong></h3>\n<p>YouTube&#8217;s user base isn&#8217;t just huge; it&#8217;s worldwide, offering your real estate services a ticket to international exposure. Imagine a potential buyer in another country, dreaming of a new home in your area, stumbling upon your video. That&#8217;s the power of YouTube.</p>\n<p>Your listings and advice aren’t just whispers in the local market; they&#8217;re broadcast worldwide, 24/7, to anyone with an internet connection.</p>\n<p>And there’s the magic of shareability. With just a click, your audience can make your content leap from YouTube to any social media platform, multiplying your visibility. In the real estate world, where word-of-mouth and networking reign supreme, YouTube is your digital megaphone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-elevate-your-expertise-build-trust\"><strong>4.

A well-curated YouTube channel brimming with insightful content does more than just attract eyeballs; it builds your credibility and positions you as an industry authority.</p>\n<p>Picture this: viewers tuning into your market analysis, town tours or buying tips, start to see you not just as a realtor but as a trusted advisor, maybe even a local celebrity of sorts. This visibility fosters a sense of familiarity and trust, which is gold in real estate.</p>\n<p>After all, buying a home is a big decision, and people gravitate towards agents they feel they know and can rely on. By consistently delivering value through your videos, answering the big questions, and demystifying the buying and selling process, you&#8217;re not just earning views; you&#8217;re earning trust, confidence, and ultimately, clients.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-turbocharge-your-site-with-seo-superpowers\"><strong>5. Turbocharge Your Site with SEO Superpowers</strong></h3>\n<p>When you dive into the world of YouTube, you&#8217;re not just stepping up your video game; you&#8217;re giving your website&#8217;s SEO a major boost.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the scoop: Google loves videos. Websites that integrate video content, especially from YouTube, often enjoy a more favorable spot in search rankings. It&#8217;s like Google&#8217;s giving you a high-five for making your site more engaging.</p>\n<p>By embedding your YouTube videos on your website, you&#8217;re essentially creating a two-way street — more visibility for your videos, and a turbo boost in traffic for your site. Plus, when your YouTube content links back to your site, you&#8217;re knitting a web of digital connections that Google can&#8217;t resist.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-convert-viewers-into-clients-with-ease\"><strong>6. Convert Viewers into Clients with Ease</strong></h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about turning the views you get on YouTube into victories. Research backs it up: websites sporting video content aren&#8217;t just catching eyes; they&#8217;re converting casual browsers into committed clients at a higher rate.</p>\n<p>Why? Because videos are the secret sauce to building trust, likability, and a sense of connection. Your YouTube channel showcases you. It&#8217;s your platform to let potential clients get to know the real you, your expertise, and your values.</p>\n<p>By the time viewers reach out, they&#8217;re not just leads &#8211; they&#8217;re pre-sold on you as their go-to realtor. It&#8217;s like your videos are doing the heavy lifting, so by the time prospects hit &#8220;contact,&#8221; they&#8217;re already convinced they want to work with you.

Effective Video Content Strategy for Realtors on YouTube</h3>\n<p>The most important thing for you to do when it comes to YouTube is to provide content that viewers are actually eager to watch. Here&#8217;s how you can nail it:</p>\n<h4 id=\"local-information\"><strong>Unlocking the Local Lifestyle</strong></h4>\n<p>Your insider knowledge is a treasure trove for those eyeing your area as their next home base. Dive into the essence of what makes living there special.</p>\n<p>From insider information about your town to detailed information about different neighborhoods, to a curated list of the top cafes, activities, and can’t-miss events, you have the power to bring your area to life for viewers. It’s about mixing practical advice with local flavor, giving a well-rounded view of the community you serve.</p>\n<p>Here are some video title ideas: “Pros and Cons of Living in your city”, “Top Dog Boarding Places in your city”, “Top 5 Activities to Do in your city”, “Gated Communities in your city”, Waterfront Living in your city”.  You get it, the potential list goes on and on.</p>\n<h4>Market Insights</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4089 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/87532ad45e9086a5-3-1.webp/public\" alt=\"Collaborative Growth - Real Estate Professionals Engaged in Discussion at a Free Investor Group Meeting\" width=\"427\" height=\"285\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-1.webp 427w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-1-300x200.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px\" /></p>\n<p>This is your chance to shine as a real estate sage. Realtors should talk about what&#8217;s happening in real estate, both locally, on the state level, and nationally. Analyze the current real estate landscape clearly and insightfully.</p>\n<p>This could include trends like rising or falling house prices, changes in days on market for selling a home, and how many homes are for sale (housing inventory). Imagine a captivating video that unpacks the reasons behind soaring house prices in a particular locale, making the complex market trends digestible and engaging for your viewers.</p>\n<p>Your aim is to enlighten and inform. You reveal your expertise through this analysis helping potential clients gain trust in you. You also give your viewers knowledge which makes them feel more confident about their decisions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"expert-tips\"><strong>Crafting Expertise with Savvy Tips</strong></h4>\n<p>Elevate your expertise by dishing out savvy advice on the home buying and selling journey. Create a series that walks buyers through the maze of purchasing their dream home or guides sellers on the art of clinching a swift sale.</p>\n<p>Sprinkle wisdom about how to stage a home for sale or how buyers should pick a lender. Here are some suggested video titles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;First-Time Homebuyer Faux Pas: Top 5 Blunders to Avoid&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Sell Like a Pro: Secrets to a Swift Sale in Any Market&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;The Pros and Cons of Buying an Older Home versus New Construction &#8211; The Great Debate&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"success-stories\"><strong>Spotlight on Success: Sharing Triumphs</strong></h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4228 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/998d9e435f7eaa61-888888.webp/public\" alt=\"Hand holding a trophy against a golden bokeh background, symbolizing success for real estate agents during a recession.\" width=\"485\" height=\"215\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888-300x133.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/888888-768x341.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" /></p>\n<p>Crafting narratives around the challenges you&#8217;ve navigated to secure wins for your clients is like striking content gold. The truth is, the mere fact of selling a home isn&#8217;t what draws people in.</p>\n<p>What captivates your audience are the behind-the-scenes tales, the hurdles jumped, and the strategies deployed to deliver outstanding outcomes. This storytelling approach lets you shine a light on your expertise and dedication without sounding self-congratulatory.</p>\n<p>After weaving these engaging success stories, sprinkle in testimonials from your satisfied clients. Hearing directly from those who&#8217;ve experienced your exceptional service first-hand can sway potential clients in your favor.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these stories of success plant seeds of hope and aspiration in viewers, whether they&#8217;re on the brink of buying or selling. It&#8217;s about painting a picture of what&#8217;s possible when they choose you as their realtor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-elevating-your-content-for-real-estate-youtube-channels\">2. Elevating Your Content for Real Estate YouTube Channels</h3>\n<p>Now that you know what content to create, let’s dial up attracting people to your content by exploring some other content improvements.</p>\n<h4>Maximizing Your Smartphone for Professional-Quality Real Estate Videos: The Importance of Sound and Lighting</h4>\n<p>Creating high-quality real estate content doesn&#8217;t necessarily require expensive equipment. You can film your videos with your cell phone, yielding impressive results. However, pay close attention to sound and lighting, as these elements play a significant role in the overall quality of your videos.</p>\n<p>Good lighting, which can be had with a couple of well-placed lights or turning away from the sun just perfectly, ensures your video footage looks inviting. Clear sound is also essential for conveying your message effectively.</p>\n<p>No one wants to listen to you talking while your voice is competing with loud background noises. Invest in an inexpensive microphone to connect to your phone. You can get decent mics for as little as $15 on Amazon. That’s well worth the investment.</p>\n<p>By ensuring your videos are well-lit and the audio is crisp and clear, you can create compelling content that competes with professionally shot videos, all from the convenience of your smartphone.</p>\n<h4 id=\"effective-video-editing-for-real-estate-content-on-youtube\">Effective Video Editing for Real Estate Content on YouTube</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4503 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/8b3cf7fb60b959ea-2-3.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"477\" height=\"272\" title=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now that you’ve filmed your content, it’s time to edit your raw video footage. Use CapCut for free, it’s super great and super easy to use – watch a couple of YouTube videos on CapCut to quickly master it.</p>\n<p>Or if you want to pay for editing software, and there isn’t any reason to do so, then I’d recommend Wondershare Filmora.  Ok, on to the editing.</p>\n<p>Of course, you’ll likely cut out your errors or footage that doesn’t add to your content first. And, here are some more ideas to put your best foot forward in <a href=\"/the-ultimate-guide-to-crafting-a-real-estate-agent-newsletter\">real estate content creation</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Seamless Storytelling with Smooth Transitions &#8211; </strong>The art of video editing lies in the flow. Smooth transitions are the backbone of professional-looking content, guiding the viewer through your town, neighborhoods, and properties as if they were walking through it themselves.\n<p>Whether you’re transitioning from a restaurant to a walking path or a sunlit living room to a cozy bedroom, using gentle fades or sleek slide effects can significantly enhance the viewing experience. It’s these polished transitions that knit your shots into a seamless narrative, keeping viewers hooked from start to finish.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Inclusive Engagement with Captions &#8211; </strong>Expanding your reach means ensuring your content is accessible to everyone. Adding captions isn’t just thoughtful; it’s strategic, opening up your videos to an international audience and those who prefer watching without sound.\n<p>Whether they’re scrolling through YouTube in a café &#8211; so they don’t want to bother other people &#8211; or they rely on captions for accessibility to different languages, this feature ensures no potential client misses out on discovering their dream home through your video.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Crafting Compact Yet Captivating Videos &#8211; </strong>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world, where attention spans are shorter than ever, crafting concise yet impactful videos is key. It&#8217;s crucial to hone your message, trimming it down to engaging, digestible highlights without sacrificing the unique elements that set your content apart.\n<p>Avoid blathering on and on or diluting your video with unnecessary filler. Stick to what&#8217;s relevant and central to your core message. A tightly edited video that swiftly captures and holds the viewer&#8217;s interest not only shows respect for viewers’ time but also leaves them intrigued and eager for more.</p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Elevate with Entertaining Edits &#8211; </strong>To truly stand out, infuse your videos with elements that entertain as well as inform. Incorporating B-roll footage adds depth to your narrative, offering viewers a fuller picture of what you have to say about your town, neighborhood, or properties.\n<p>Strategic use of stickers, sound effects, and dynamic pans and zooms can inject personality and flair into your content, making for a more entertaining viewing experience. These creative touches not only enhance the visual appeal of your videos but also significantly improve watch time by keeping viewers engaged and entertained throughout.</p>\n<p>Not sure where to start to decide on these entertaining elements? Watch the content of others until you find something that you find entertaining. Try to emulate that.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Sky-High Views with Drone Footage</strong></h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4502 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/dca0adb442b1cc2c-3-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"452\" height=\"258\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-2.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-2-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" /></p>\n<p>Elevate your town tours, neighborhood tours and property showcases with the magic of drone footage. This isn&#8217;t just about giving a bird&#8217;s eye view; it&#8217;s about offering a mesmerizing perspective that ground-level shots can&#8217;t capture.</p>\n<p>Drone footage turns ordinary tours into an extraordinary visual journey, highlighting homes and places with stunning clarity.</p>\n<p>Does this sound expensive? Well, it can add up if you’re hiring a local expert for every drone shot. But, you don’t need to do that. Invest in your own drone. You can get one for under $400 on Amazon.</p>\n<p>I use DJI Mini Pro 3. It’s more expensive than the starter drones, but I appreciate that it has some settings for moving the drone in the sky. Without those, I find that the drone shots can be a bit jerky and I spend a lot of time just editing out those jerks. So, the drone I use saves me editing time which, for me, is worth the additional expense.</p>\n<h4><strong>Connect and Clarify with Live Q&#038;A Sessions</strong></h4>\n<p>Another way to up your content game is to get more real with live Q&#038;A sessions. This interactive format invites viewers to dive in and ask their burning questions, creating a direct line of communication between you and your audience.</p>\n<p>Tackling topics like the intricacies of mortgages or the specifics of closing costs during these sessions offers a prime opportunity to demystify the real estate process. It&#8217;s a chance to directly address viewer concerns, simplify the complexities of the industry, and highlight your expertise and personality.</p>\n<p>And remember, you don&#8217;t have to go it solo. Bringing in a co-host, whether it’s a colleague or an industry expert, can enrich the session, broadening the scope of knowledge and insights you can offer. This collaborative approach ensures your audience gets comprehensive answers to their questions.</p>\n<p>Unsure of how to kick things off? YouTube Live hosts these engaging streaming sessions. Do a google search on how to get started.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-mastering-calls-to-action-transform-viewers-into-clients-with-your-real-estate-youtube-content\"><strong>3. Mastering Calls to Action: Transform Viewers into Clients with Your Real Estate YouTube Content</strong></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4500 alignleft\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/80cad9ec77227f10-4-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"454\" height=\"259\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-1.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-1-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px\" /></p>\n<p>Crafting compelling Calls to Action (CTAs) in your real estate videos is crucial for converting viewers into active participants in your business. Here’s how to effectively guide your audience to the next step:</p>\n<h4><strong>Grow Your Viewers by Encouraging Subscriptions</strong></h4>\n<p>Building your YouTube presence hinges on expanding your subscriber base. During your video or at its end, remind your viewers to like, subscribe, and hit the bell notifications so that they will be notified of the next time you drop some more information.</p>\n<h4><strong>Offer Value &#038; Personal Contact</strong></h4>\n<p>Conclude your videos with a warm invitation for viewers to connect with you directly. A simple yet effective CTA like, &#8220;To learn more or see this property, reach out to me. My contact information is in the description below.” This prompts immediate action and helps to make viewers feel uniquely valued.</p>\n<p>For those not ready for immediate action, expand your client base by offering a newsletter sign-up or a home buyer or home seller guide. I like to make these CTAs as easy as possible for people. For example, you could say, “To get my free real estate newsletter, email me with the subject line “newsletter”.</p>\n<p>This approach builds your database of interested leads providing you the opportunity for continuous nurturing, keeping you top of mind for when they&#8217;re ready to make their move. By delivering valuable content regularly, you establish a relationship of trust and expertise.</p>\n<h4><strong>Amplify Your Reach: Promote Sharing</strong></h4>\n<p>Leveraging the power of sharing can dramatically extend your video’s visibility. Encourage viewers to pass your content along by saying, &#8220;Found this guide helpful? Share it with someone embarking on their home-buying adventure!&#8221; This strategy not only widens your audience but also enhances your credibility, as personal recommendations carry considerable weight.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-considering-targeting-a-specific-audience-with-relevant-content\">4. Considering Targeting a Specific Audience With Relevant Content</h3>\n<p>Now that you know what topics to cover in your videos, how to keep viewers watching your content, and how to encourage people to reach out to you, you can take your efforts a step further by targeting specific audiences that can truly set you apart as a niche expert.</p>\n<p>This targeted approach to specific audiences not only attracts your ideal market but also positions you as the go-to agent within that niche. Explore these potential focus areas to refine your content strategy:</p>\n<h4><strong>Guidance for First-Time Homebuyers</strong></h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4277 alignright\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/613f727154c7d78c-cold-calling.webp/public\" alt=\"Smiling real estate agent engaged in a cold call conversation, showcasing effective communication for client prospecting.\" width=\"461\" height=\"263\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cold-calling-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" /></p>\n<p>First-time homebuyers often embark on their property journey feeling overwhelmed and uncertain.

Employ visually striking thumbnails and compelling descriptions to capture the attention of this discerning audience from the get-go.</p>\n<h4><strong>Spotlight on Family-Friendly Living</strong></h4>\n<p>Families looking for the perfect home prioritize factors like education, safety, and community. Videos that spotlight the merits of family-friendly suburbs, emphasizing aspects such as top-rated schools, neighborhood safety, and community events, can resonate deeply with this demographic.</p>\n<p>Demonstrating your knowledge of what truly matters to families shows that you’re not just selling houses, but homes that fit their dreams and needs.

    "content": "<p>Let’s cut the fluff—starting a real estate career isn’t all sold signs and sunset selfies. Most new agents wash out before their business cards are even scuffed. I knew that. I’m a UC Berkeley Law grad, a former California attorney, and now a lawyer turned real estate agent. Translation: I don’t jump into risky ventures without some serious digging.</p>\n<p>So when it came time to choose my brokerage, I put on my lawyer hat and did the deep dive. Calls. Interviews. More Google tabs than anyone should admit. And what do I find? Most brokerages are stuck in the past, nickel-and-diming agents while offering very little in return. Then I found eXp Realty, and my entire view of what a real estate career could be shifted.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re trying to build a lasting eXp Realty career instead of becoming just another statistic in the 87% failure rate, this story’s for you.</p>\n<p>Here’s your handy-dandy index:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#real-estate-agent-failure-rate\">Real Estate Agent Failure Rate</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#realtors-as-entrepreneurs\">Realtors as Entrepreneurs</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#real-estate-is-risky-business\">Real Estate is Risky Business</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#my-traditional-brokerages-vs-exp-realty-research\">My Traditional Brokerages vs eXp Realty Research</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-split-pay-out\">Commission Split Pay Out</a></p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#traditional-brokerage-commission-split\">Traditional Brokerage Commission Split</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#exp-realty-commission-split\">eXp Realty Commission Split</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#fees-charged-to-real-estate-agents\">Fees Charged to Real Estate Agents</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-for-new-real-estate-agents\">Training for New Real Estate Agents</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#and-theres-more\">And, There’s More…</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-my-e-xp-realty-career-was-the-best-business-decision-ive-made\">Why My eXp Realty Career Was the Best Business Decision I’ve Made</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></p>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-estate-agent-failure-rate\"><strong>Real Estate Agent Failure Rate</strong></h2>\n<p>How did I know <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/brokerage-interview-questions/\">choosing the right brokerage</a> would be super important? Well, as a lawyer and real estate agent, I understood the risks involved. The National Association of Realtors reported that <strong>75% of realtors fail</strong> within the first year, and <a href=\"https://blog.tomferry.com/87-of-all-agents-fail-in-real-estate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>87% fail</strong> within five years</a>. <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/broker-news/network/why-do-new-sales-associates-fail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">There are lots of reasons for the agent failure rate.</a></p>\n<p>That’s right! Only <strong>13% of agents make it past a 5-year career</strong>! Oh my, better do some research to increase those odds.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"realtors-as-entrepreneurs\"><strong>Realtors as Entrepreneurs</strong></h2>\n<p>Before I jump into what I learned about different brokerages, the first key thing I learned in my quest to find a great brokerage was that agents operate as sole business owners. I hadn’t thought about that before.</p>\n<p>As a buyer and seller of my personal homes, I’ve worked with many agents over the decades and I always thought an agent’s brokerage was paying for something. I didn’t know what. Maybe the agent’s time? Maybe advertising costs for listings?</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/de3da5816d1f3691-1.webp/public\" alt=\"Calculator with the word &#039;FEES&#039; on the display, surrounded by U.S. currency and coin stacks, depicting realtor expenses.\" class=\"wp-image-4438 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1.webp 500w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1-300x171.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Beats me, but the way agents go on about how great their brokerages are, I assumed brokerages paid for some agent expenses of doing business. That is usually completely wrong. So that you don’t get blindsided, let me fill you in on some of what agents generally pay for:</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Costs of listing a home</strong> <strong>–</strong> Agents also pay for the costs of listing a home for sale – the professional photographers, the drones, the floor plans, the 3d home walk-throughs, the flyers, and other print marketing materials, all the advertising, and even the expense of the signs in front of the homes and the lockboxes that other agents will use to open the homes with their electronic app.</p>\n<p><strong>Association Fees</strong> <strong>–</strong> like fees to be members of professional associations like the <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/broker-news/network/why-do-new-sales-associates-fail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Association of Realtors</a>, your state’s Association of Realtors, and your local agent association, and fees from <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/mls-online-listings/multiple-listing-service-mls-what-is-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">your MLS</a> (which stands for multiple listing service).</p>\n<p><strong>Key fees</strong> <strong>–</strong> you know, those little electronic apps that agents use to open houses with their phones. Well, agents pay for that key access to their local MLS every month. And, if an agent does business outside their main MLS? Well, they will have to pay key fees for that too, and maybe the association fees of the area as well.</p>\n<p><strong>General Business Expenses</strong> <strong>–</strong> Agents also pay for the cost of <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/errors-omissions-eo-insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">E&#038;O insurance</a>, which stands for Errors &#038; Omissions, and all agents must have it. Agents also usually pay for their business cards, computers, phones, and cars, including all costs associated with using that car for business.</p>\n<p><strong>Lead Generation Costs –</strong> if you send postcards to a neighborhood to try to dig up some prospects, you’ll cover the costs of the design, printing, and postage for those. If you make phone calls, you’ll pay for a service to provide the phone numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you think a real estate agent just cashes big checks, think again. In this eXp Realty career (or any real estate path), agents front the costs—marketing, tools, time, gas, sanity. It’s all on us until (and unless) a deal closes—no salary, no safety net, just pure hustle.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-estate-is-risky-business\"><strong>Real Estate is Risky Business</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/15889650e4690236-2-1.webp/public\" alt=\"eXp Realty Career, Silhouette of a person tightrope walking between cliffs at sunset, embodying the risks of the real estate business.\" class=\"wp-image-4443\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-1-300x107.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-1-768x273.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Let’s be real: if the deal doesn’t close, the agent doesn’t get paid. That means hours (or months) of work can go straight to the unpaid labor hall of fame. As both a lawyer and a real estate agent, I don’t take lightly how unpredictable this career can be.</p>\n<p>You can’t control clients, the market, or whether that dream house suddenly sprouts mold in the attic. What can you control? Your brokerage. Choose wisely—your odds of success depend on it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"my-traditional-brokerages-vs-exp-realty-research\"><strong>My Traditional Brokerages vs eXp Realty Research</strong></h2>\n<p>I started my search for a brokerage online. I narrowed down my choices first based mostly on the size and “success” of the brokerage. Small firms didn’t interest me as I knew that those would never have enough big profits to provide great support, tools, resources, and innovation to meet changing needs over time.</p>\n<p>Here are the brokerages I chose to dive in further with: I researched traditional brokerages &#8211; Compass, Vanguard, Sotheby’s, Coldwell Banker, and Remax &#8211; because they are big names with a local presence.</p>\n<p>And, I also researched eXp Realty because it’s the fastest-growing brokerage in U.S. history and on the planet. That must mean something, and eXp also has listed stock and is part of the S&#038;P 600.</p>\n<p>My research strategy included looking up online information, talking with agents and managers at the various firms, and also meeting in person with some brokerage managers.</p>\n<p>Here are the highlights:</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-split-pay-out\">Commission Split Pay Out</h2>\n<p>What did I care about the most? Of course, how much would I get paid?</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traditional-brokerage-commission-split\">Traditional Brokerage Commission Split</h3>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 32%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>With the big traditional brokerages, the first thing I learned is that commission splits vary. That is, there is no transparent split. These brokerages make individual deals with agents based on how much value the agent brings to the brokerage.</p>\n<p>So, what would be my deal as a <a data-wpil-monitor-id=\"13\" href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/is-exp-realty-good-for-new-agents/\">new agent</a>? Higher than I heard was offered to other new agents in my area, probably because of my legal background and long-time local sphere of influence (meaning I know a lot of people already who might become a client). Remember, commission splits vary with these traditional brokerages.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"253\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/eba2b577f67a6e07-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4439 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n</div>\n<p>My split offer? At Sotheby’s and Compass, I was told I’d get a 70/30 split &#8211; that’s 70% to me and 30% to them. That seemed pretty good, as those of you watching some of those reality programs about selling real estate have probably heard that most of those agents get a 50% commission split, with the brokerage keeping 50% of their commission checks.</p>\n<p>So 70/30 seemed good. But, then I found out that there’s a huge “transaction fee” aka “franchise fee” of 6% per deal. Wait. What? Doesn’t that make my split 64/36?</p>\n<p>Anyway, the other large brokerages had various payouts, all about the same as Sotheby’s and Compass. All these traditional brokerages are clearly impacted by the high costs of their structures &#8211; physical offices and layers of franchise middlemen.</p>\n<p>The bottom line, traditional brokerages have high expenses and those must all be paid by the agents. Their commission splits need to benefit the brokerage to stay in business. Want to compare these yourself? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/traditional\">real estate brokerage comparisons</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-commission-split\">eXp Realty Commission Split</h3>\n<p>With that knowledge, I researched eXp Realty. Much easier to research because agent pay is totally transparent. Every agent gets paid the same and that is an 80/20 split to start with – so this <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/commission\">eXp commission split</a> is already better than the traditional brokerage’s commission split that I was offered.</p>\n<p>But it gets better! Once an eXp agent has paid eXp Realty just $16,000 from the 20% that eXp earns per deal, that agent then “caps” and eXp pays that agent 100% of their commission for the rest of the agent’s calendar year.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:33% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"256\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/adf4949664a3372e-3.webp/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4440 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>This is huge! No traditional brokerage I researched had any cap for agents, so those brokerages continue to take their cut of agent commissions for every single deal an agent does.</p>\n<p>But again, at eXp, it even gets better than that. I know this is crazy! So not only does every agent get an 80/20 split that can turn into a 100% payout, but every agent also has the same opportunity to earn even more.</p>\n<p>That is, when agents meet certain requirements, they get their full amount paid to eXp – the $16,000 – back in company stock. Thereby, those agents – <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/icon-agent\">called ICON agents</a> earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/100-percent\">100% of their commissions</a> for the entire year. Wow! Really?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Are you wondering how eXp Realty can afford to do this? I was. The answer? eXp can do it because they don’t have the huge expenses of the traditional brokerage model.</p>\n<p>They don’t have the expense of physical offices (think Netflix instead of Blockbuster), and they don’t have multi-layers of franchise middlemen (usually 3 or 4 layers deep) who all need their cut of an agent’s commission. At eXp there are 2 layers of payment &#8211; eXp and the agents.</p>\n<p>Oh, and before you think, but I need an office space, let me clarify. eXp’s full staff works on the cloud in our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/exp-world\">eXp World</a> which is easy and fun to access for all agent needs. However, because eXp is a large profitable company, it wields a lot of negotiating power.</p>\n<p>Therefore, they have worked out a deal with <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/offices\">Regus shared offices</a> which are located all over the world. eXp agents can use Regus lounge spaces for free! There are 2 Regus offices by me, so I can go there, if I choose, to meet clients or just hang out if I don’t want to work from home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees-charged-to-real-estate-agents\"><strong>Fees Charged to Real Estate Agents</strong></h2>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/87532ad45e9086a5-3-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4444\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-1-300x103.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/3-1-768x263.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>What was the next most important thing to me in deciding which brokerage to join? Fees, of course! How much would I have to pay the brokerage in fees?</p>\n<p>All the brokerages, eXp included, have small fees, like $100, $200, or $300 for various things ranging from monthly fees to having a desk in an office, to a broker reviewing agent transactions.</p>\n<p>But I got hung up on this huge difference:</p>\n<p>Both Sotheby’s and Compass said there was a $2200 upfront fee that I would need to pay as soon as I joined their brokerage. I’d owe that amount every year before I did any deals at all.</p>\n<p>What is the charge for? E&#038;O insurance coverage. That’s errors and omissions insurance, and all agents must have it.</p>\n<p>eXp charges agents for E&#038;O insurance too, but it’s much less than what traditional brokerages charge and, most importantly, it’s not paid upfront before an agent makes a single dime.</p>\n<p>Instead, eXp agents pay just <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/e-and-o\">$60 per deal that they close to cover E&#038;O charges</a>. And that caps too. I know another cap! Don’t you love it! E&#038;O insurance caps at $750 for the year, so eXp agents will never pay the $2200 that the traditional brokerages charge.</p>\n<p>The last thing about fees that I want to mention is that <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/fees\">eXp has much lower “smaller” fees</a> across the board, and also, agents get a lot more value from the brokerage for those small fees than what was available from the large traditional brokerages.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-for-new-real-estate-agents\"><strong>Training for New Real Estate Agents</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/ac9daa55f94d7f39-4.webp/public\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4441 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-300x171.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/4-768x438.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>The last thing I cared about in choosing a brokerage was the available training. No traditional brokerage came close to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/training\">eXp’s training</a>.  It starts with the over 50 hours of live training every week that is available at eXp Realty. Plus, eXp has four other modes of training with on-demand training in eXp University, new agent training with the Go Curriculum, and live training of KickStart and FastCap.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>On top of that, the quality of the training is top-notch as it’s much of it is taught by currently producing top agents. It’s easy to access any training I want to attend, as they are all video calls. So, no trip to an office.</p>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://eventscalendar.exprealty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eXp publishes a list of what training is available</a> in the upcoming week. That allows me to choose to attend meetings with topics that challenge me and skip ones I am confident about.</p>\n<p>All the traditional brokerages had a much less organized way of agent training, or they just told me to go to a seminar, one that would cost me over $2000 to learn. I preferred the free, cool online access that eXp offers.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"and-theres-more\">And, There’s More…</h2>\n<p>So yes—after all my legal sleuthing and brokerage deep dives, I landed at eXp Realty. As a lawyer and real estate agent, I knew I wasn’t signing up for just any brokerage. I wanted one that could actually back me up with the tools, training, and support to make this whole real estate gig work. But what didn’t I expect? How much more there was to the story after I joined, especially when it came to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/basics\">eXp Realty’s sponsor program</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, I’ll admit it: I got lucky. Like four times over.</p>\n<p>First lucky break? I even <em>found out</em> about eXp Realty’s sponsor structure. This isn&#8217;t some tired “team lead gets a cut” model like you see at traditional brokerages. Nope. eXp has a seven-layer sponsor support system. (Yes, seven. Like real estate inception.) It was built to reward agents for helping others grow, not just for recruiting’s sake.</p>\n<p>Second win? I learned early on that <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/find-yours\">choosing your eXp sponsor is a one-shot deal</a>. Once you name someone on your eXp application, that’s your person. No take-backs unless you leave the company for a year and come back. Yikes. So yeah, I took that part <em>very</em> seriously.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"228\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/1b12190bcba5703e-real-estate-transaction-management-Benefits-of-Using-SkySlope.webp/public\" alt=\"real estate transaction management, Benefits of Using SkySlope\" class=\"wp-image-265291\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/real-estate-transaction-management-Benefits-of-Using-SkySlope.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/real-estate-transaction-management-Benefits-of-Using-SkySlope-300x68.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/real-estate-transaction-management-Benefits-of-Using-SkySlope-768x175.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Third stroke of genius (or maybe obsessive research)? I chose the Wolf Pack. Based on reviews, calls, and actual conversations with agents—not just shiny promo videos—I could tell they were different. They offer video courses, weekly live coaching, and most importantly, real community. This wasn’t just a team—it became my people.</p>\n<p>And finally, let’s talk about the fourth jackpot: <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share-2\">revenue share</a>. I didn’t even dig into that too deeply before I joined, but it turns out eXp Realty isn’t just the best when it comes to passive income—it’s the <em>only</em> brokerage that lets agents get creative about it. You can build your own brand within the model, bring agents into your group, and provide them with your own custom value stack.</p>\n<p>Which is exactly what my partner Doug Smart and I did. We launched Smart Agent Alliance, our own sponsor group within eXp Realty. Agents who name us as their sponsor don’t just get our full arsenal of passive income support, lead generation tools, templates, and training—they also get everything the Wolf Pack offers. That’s right: two powerhouse teams for the price of&#8230; free. Literally. It’s all included.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: I chose eXp Realty, I chose the Wolf Pack, and I built Smart Agent Alliance—and the value we offer is more than anyone else. It’s no wonder eXp keeps topping <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Glassdoor’s best places to work</a>, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/reviews\">anonymous agent reviews</a>, and smashing growth records. As someone who left law to build something bigger, I’ve found the kind of career support most agents only dream of. And now, I get to offer that same support to others. That’s what I call a solid return on research.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-my-e-xp-realty-career-was-the-best-business-decision-ive-made\"><strong>Why My eXp Realty Career Was the Best Business Decision I’ve Made</strong></h2>\n<p>Looking back, choosing an eXp Realty career wasn’t just a smart move—it was the game-changer.

The transparent commission splits, capped fees, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/stock-awards\">stock awards</a>, and training that actually teaches you how to succeed?

Commission is the bread and butter of your income in this business. It&#8217;s the fee that you, as an agent, earn for your top-notch services in making those property deals happen.</p>\n<p>Now, here&#8217;s the nitty-gritty &#8211; it&#8217;s usually a percentage of the final sale price of the property. But remember, if the deal doesn&#8217;t close, there&#8217;s no commission for you.</p>\n<h3 id=\"real-estate-agent-commission-mechanics\">Real Estate Agent Commission Mechanics</h3>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how commission fees usually work: when a home gets sold, the seller typically pays the total commission due, and that goes to their trusty seller&#8217;s agent.</p>\n<p>The exact commission percentage? Well, that&#8217;s something the seller and their agent work out and put down in black and white in their contract.</p>\n<p>Now, here&#8217;s where the rubber meets the road &#8211; that contract also spells out what price the seller&#8217;s agent is willing to fork over to the buyer&#8217;s agents so that buyer agents will help them sell the home.</p>\n<p>This buyer agent&#8217;s fee is public knowledge as it is listed in the home&#8217;s MLS (Multiple Listing Service) listing. When the deal goes through and the home changes hands, the agents on both sides of the deal get paid.</p>\n<p>Quick heads up, though &#8211; keep an eye out for potential changes in these payment structures. New laws might be on the horizon, and they could shake things up. But for now, this is how the real estate agent commission game is typically played.</p>\n<h3 id=\"real-estate-agent-commission-payment-process\">Real Estate Agent Commission Payment Process</h3>\n<p>How does this whole process come together? Well, it all revolves around what we call &#8220;escrow.&#8221; Think of escrow as a secure holding area where a chunk of the payment &#8211; called the earnest money deposit &#8211; is safely stashed away until every little home sale detail is sorted out.</p>\n<p>Once the details are sorted, the balance of the sale’s price is deposited for correct distribution to the parties involved. Here&#8217;s the breakdown:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Imagine a buyer is head over heels for a house and agrees on a purchase price with the seller.</li>\n<li>The buyer’s earnest money deposit &#8211; typically 3% of the purchase price in California &#8211; gets parked in escrow while the buyer does their homework on the property and lines up the funds for the purchase.</li>\n<li>Next, the trusty escrow officer steps in and provides a statement detailing how the total purchase amount will be divvied up. That’s when real estate agent commission get subtracted from the seller&#8217;s side of the financial equation.</li>\n<li>When the details are all sorted and the entire sale is funded and recorded in government records, we say the deal &#8220;closes&#8221; and ownership of the home officially passes to the new owner. That’s when we agents get our well-deserved commission for making it all happen.</li>\n<li>Now, when it comes to agents getting that real estate agent commission money into their bank account, here&#8217;s how it usually rolls: initially, agent commissions are paid by escrow to the respective agents&#8217; brokerage firms. These firms take their slice of the commission and then dish out the agent&#8217;s cut.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"services-to-earn-real-estate-agent-commission\">Services to Earn Real Estate Agent Commission</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4325\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/9bdf52e8961d0658-2-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"418\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-2-300x125.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-2-768x321.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of what agents typically do to earn their real estate agent commission, it&#8217;s essential to recognize that agents invest their time and their own money to assist clients in buying or selling properties.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the kicker:  brokerages usually do not pay agents anything for their time and brokerages usually do not reimburse agents for their expenses. So let’s look at the typical time and expenses that agents incur to potentially earn a real estate agent commission:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Seller agents dedicate their time to guiding homeowners through the intricacies of the selling process. They offer valuable advice on prepping the home for sale, often arranging for necessary improvements or inspections.Seller agents pay out of pocket for photographers, videographers, drone shots, marketing materials, and all home advertising. Once the home is on the market, seller agents invest their time in scheduling viewings, fielding queries from potential buyers, and ultimately, hammering out deals and handling the essential paperwork.</li>\n<li>On the flip side, buyer agents invest their time in the search for suitable homes and personally accompany prospective buyers on property visits. They also take the time to educate buyers on the home-buying process, even assisting them in connecting with lenders, home inspectors, and other needed real estate vendors. Buyer agents negotiate the deal and once the deal is agreed on, the agents complete the essential paperwork and ensure seamless transactions by coordinating with seller agents, lenders, and escrow officers.</li>\n<li>Buyer and Seller Agents also must shell out money for their business operations &#8211; think licensing fees, MLS expenses, professional association dues, office space, tech gear, advertising, phone bills, and car maintenance and brokerage fees.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Again, real estate agents pour their time and money into these endeavors BEFORE they see a dime in real estate agent commission and with no guarantee that they will ever receive a commission.</p>\n<p>And, frankly, often real estate agents shell out money that is never reimbursed as it’s easy for clients to back out of deals when they have no skin in the game. Some might call “real estate agent” a risky profession.</p>\n<h2 id=\"client-perspective-on-real-estate-agent-commission-rates\">Client Perspective on Real Estate Agent Commission Rates</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4326\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/6bc706a70d1d3e06-3-4.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"457\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-4.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-4-300x137.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/3-4-768x351.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you have insight into how agents invest their precious time and money, all in the hopes of eventually earning a real estate agent commission, let&#8217;s shift our focus to how clients often view the commission issue.</p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, both sellers and buyers tend to primarily consider what they will owe their agent, overlooking the fact that agents undertake these endeavors with no guaranteed payout &#8211; a risky proposition that, when successful, compensates for the occasions their investment pays nothing.</p>\n<p>Seller Considerations: Sellers carefully weigh commission rates. They want to maximize their proceeds from the sale, but, on the other hand, they often understand that a great agent can help them sell their home quickly and at the best price.</p>\n<p>Of course, market conditions also play into their views. If the market is flooded with homes for sale, sellers may be more satisfied with paying a reasonable real estate agent commission.</p>\n<p>Buyer Perspectives: The rules have changed for buyers and now they make a contract with their buyer agent to pay the agent a fee for the agent&#8217;s service. That agreed upon fee is generally not paid until a deal has closed. That fee will often be covered by the seller as a closing cost, but if not, buyers can pay their agents directly in escrow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"negotiating-real-estate-agent-commission-rates-with-clients\">Negotiating Real Estate Agent Commission Rates with Clients</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4327\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/80cad9ec77227f10-4-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4-1-300x139.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4-1-768x355.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;re aware of how clients might perceive real estate agent commission rates, let&#8217;s explore what real estate agents can do to excel in negotiating their commission rates.</p>\n<p>Negotiation Skills: Real estate agents must possess exceptional negotiation skills, particularly when discussing their compensation with clients or brokers. Agents who excel in this area often have the potential to earn higher incomes.</p>\n<p>Value Proposition: The best method to excel in this real estate agent commission conversation is for agents to know what their unique value proposition is.  What do you bring to the table that other agents don’t have?  Your legal background?  Your 20 years of experience?  Your team’s record of success?  Your deep local knowledge?</p>\n<p>Agents that communicate a unique value proposition, set themselves apart from other agents, and effectively convey why they deserve their real estate agent commission rate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"general-real-estate-agent-commission-rates\">General Real Estate Agent Commission Rates</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4328\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/116d8fe19ec9d3b0-5-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"416\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-2-300x125.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5-2-768x319.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got some background information on commission rates, let&#8217;s delve into the specifics of what real estate agents can expect to earn from their total commission.</p>\n<h3 id=\"variations-in-real-estate-agent-commission-rates\">Variations in Real Estate Agent Commission Rates</h3>\n<p>The world of commission rates is diverse, but in the United States, residential commission rates are usually 2.5% to 3% of the sale price. </p>\n<p>However, real estate agent commission rates can be both higher and lower. For instance, some may opt for discounted total commission rates as low as 1% to 1.5%.  These lower rates generally come with inexperienced agents or agents who provide less service.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, some agents, with great experience and proven outcomes, may charge 3.5% to 4%. Plus sometime higher commissions come with additional services, such as the agent paying for the home staging, which is an expense typically paid for by the seller.</p>\n<h3 id=\"full-time-vs-part-time-agents\">Full-Time vs. Part-Time Agents</h3>\n<p>Another factor to consider in total real estate agent commission earned is the distinction between full-time and part-time agents. Not surprisingly, full-time agents that can dedicate all their working hours to agent tasks generally earn more income than their part-time counterparts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-countries\">Other Countries</h3>\n<p>Some countries have lower or higher averages than the U.S. For example, in some European countries, rates might be below 4% between both the buyer and seller agent, while in others they could reach up to 7%. It&#8217;s interesting to see how different places value real estate services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"commission-rates-vs-brokerage-models\">Commission Rates vs Brokerage Models</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4329\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/769aea5a6f8e7fe8-6-2.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"451\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6-2.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6-2-300x135.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6-2-768x346.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>As you know, brokerages take a split of the earned real estate agent commission.  This split is in exchange for the branding, resources, and tools provided by the brokerage to the agents.  Let’s start with how different brokerages tend to allocate their share of your commission. There are various models for this, but we&#8217;ll explore four main ones:</p>\n<h3 id=\"traditional-franchise-model-split\">Traditional Franchise Model Split</h3>\n<p>This model includes the most common names out there like Compass, Sotheby’s, Coldwell Banker, and ReMax.  With these large franchises, agents typically pay the highest real estate agent commission splits to their brokerage.</p>\n<p>While the exact real estate commission split varies between brokerages and even between the agents in the same local brokerage office, common split ratios include 50/50, 60/40, or 70/30, where the agent generally keeps the larger percentage and the lesser one goes to the brokerage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"small-independent-model-split\"><strong>Small Independent Model Split</strong></h3>\n<p>Small independent brokerages often arose by a few agents breaking away from a large traditional model and starting their own brokerage.  As such, real estate agent commission splits tend to follow the traditional franchise model split, but in some cases, the split may be slightly better than the large traditional model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cloud-based-model-split\">Cloud-Based Model Split</h3>\n<p>The cloud-based model offers more favorable real estate agent commission splits, typically ranging from 80/20 to 100/0 minus some fees.  Additionally, some cloud-based models also have a cap.  A cap limits the amount of commission earned by the brokerage.</p>\n<p>So, for example, at eXp Realty, agents have an 80/20 split until the agent has paid eXp $16,000 from their earned commissions.  After that, the agent earns 100% of their commissions for the rest of their calendar year.  Oh, and spoiler alert, at exp Realty, there’s also a path for agents to get back the $16,000 they paid to exp back in company stock.  Crazy great for agents!</p>\n<h3 id=\"100percent-real-estate-agent-commission-brokerages\">100% Real Estate Agent Commission Brokerages</h3>\n<p>Some brokerages allow agents to retain their entire real estate commission.  There, agents pay predetermined fees to the brokerage for each transaction.  That sounds great, right?  Well maybe.  It depends on what the brokerage offers in value to the agents.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"production-teams\"><strong>Production Teams</strong></h3>\n<p>Another aspect of all the brokerage models that can significantly impact real estate agent commission is when the agent voluntarily joins a brokerage production team. These teams are found in all brokerage models.</p>\n<p>In essence, agents of production teams allocate a portion of their real estate agent commission to the team in return for various team-related benefits, such as services, leads, or collaborative partnerships.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s typical for a team to claim a commission share from the agent ranging from 25% to 50% of an agent&#8217;s commissions. Importantly, this split is exclusively deducted from the agent&#8217;s earnings and does not impact the brokerage&#8217;s share.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brokerage-value-for-agents\">Brokerage Value for Agents</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4330\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/357e951086337e46-7-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"421\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-1-300x126.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-1-768x323.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you know the various real estate agent commission splits that agents typically receive with different brokerage models, what value do various brokerage models typically provide for the agents?</p>\n<p>Understanding this value can help agents determine which brokerage model is best for them. Agents also need to reflect and understand their own needs to assess which brokerage model is best for them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"types-of-agent-support\">Types of Agent Support</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Technology support – Some brokerages provide tools like CRMs (customer relationship management) systems to streamline and organize the daily work of their agents.</li>\n<li>Websites – Some brokerages offer personalized IDX websites for their agents to market their services and provide to prospective clients to help establish agent credibility.</li>\n<li>Administrative support – Excellent support allows agents to focus their energy on selling homes rather than getting bogged down by paperwork and other tasks.</li>\n<li>Training programs – These hold substantial importance, especially for <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/is-exp-realty-good-for-new-agents/\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"10\">new agents</a>. Enhanced training programs often lead to higher real estate agent commission in the long run, equipping agents with the knowledge and skills they need to excel in their roles.</li>\n<li>Networking – Being affiliated with a brokerage that boasts an extensive accessible network can open doors to more opportunities for selling properties and increasing earnings.</li>\n<li>Marketing tools – These include everything useful to agents from designing and sending postcards to having customizable marketing needs like flyers and social media posts.</li>\n<li>Leads – some brokerages have systems in place to generate leads to their agents.</li>\n<li>Mentorship opportunities – These quickly help new agents start to produce real estate agent commission</li>\n<li>Other income opportunities – Some brokerage models offer opportunities to earn an income by growing the brokerage company by encouraging other agents to join.</li>\n<li>Niche support – Some brokerages are set up to support special real estate niches like commercial sales or luxury sales.</li>\n<li>Niche Partnerships – Some brokerages offer specialized services to agents and their clients like partners that prepare homes for sale by remodeling and staging them or partners that provide all cash offers to sellers who want to avoid the complications of selling on the market.</li>\n<li>Niche Vendors – some brokerages have relationships with real estate vendors that can provide discounts for clients, vendors such as lenders, and title companies.</li>\n<li>Healthcare – Most brokerages do not offer any plans for agents but some do.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"comparing-brokerage-advantages-and-disadvantages\">Comparing Brokerage Advantages &#038; Disadvantages</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4331\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/c117ce54a3fa6ae1-8-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"408\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-1-300x122.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/8-1-768x313.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>First, let’s compare the advantages and disadvantages of large franchise models vs small independent models.  When evaluating large traditional franchise models like Compass, Sotheby’s, and Coldwell Banker against smaller independent brokerages, both frequently maintain physical office spaces for agents to work and meet clients.  Here are some differences:</p>\n<p><strong>Pros of the Large Franchise Model:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong Brand Appeal: Large franchise firms often possess compelling brand recognition that can attract clients.</li>\n<li>Extensive Training: Many of them offer comprehensive training programs, although some may require agents to cover training costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons of the Large Franchise Model:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inflexible Real Estate Agent Commission Splits &#038; Rates: Large firms are less likely to offer much room for agents to negotiate their commission.  Additionally, large firms are less likely to allow agents free reign to set their own commission rates.</li>\n<li>Less Control &#038; Flexibility: With the focus on maintaining the large brokerage’s branding, agents are limited in the choices they can make regarding their business.</li>\n<li>Impersonal Feel: Due to their size, large firms may create an impersonal environment for agents.</li>\n<li>Higher Fees: A portion of an agent’s real estate agent commission goes to the franchisor, raising what agents pay in general.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pros of the Small Independent Model:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flexible Real Estate Agent Commission Splits and Rates – </strong>Independent brokerages are more likely to have more room to negotiate agent splits and more flexibility in allowing agents to set their real estate agent commission rates.</li>\n<li><strong>Control and Flexibility:</strong> Independent firms grant agents more autonomy over their work, allowing them to set competitive rates and exercise complete control over their business practices including their own branding.</li>\n<li><strong>Lower Fees:</strong> Independents do not impose franchise fees, potentially resulting in agents paying lesser fees overall compared to the franchise model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons of the Small Independent Model:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Less-Recognized Brands:</strong> Smaller firms may have lesser-known brands, necessitating extra effort to establish trust with new clients.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"franchise-and-independent-vs-cloud-based\">Franchise &#038; Independent vs Cloud-Based</h3>\n<p>Now that we’ve covered the pros and cons of large franchise brokerages versus small independent brokerages, let’s compare both of those against the cloud-based model.</p>\n<p>Cloud-based models are considered a disrupter to the old traditional models – much like how Netflix disrupted video viewing once dominated by Blockbuster. Some believe cloud-based models offer the best of both worlds and more.</p>\n<p>The primary disparity between the traditional brokerages and cloud-based models lies in the absence of physical brokerage office space.  However, there are exceptions like eXp Realty provides free agent access to Regus shared office spaces worldwide.  Still, agents in cloud-based offices may miss the easy access to having interactions with peers around the water cooler.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the primary advantage of cloud-based versus traditional models is the typical much higher real estate agent commission split that can be earned and the “cap” on how much the brokerage can earn from each agent.  Here are some more differences:</p>\n<p><strong>Pros of Cloud-Based Models:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extensive Training: Larger cloud-based models often offer more comprehensive and high-quality training compared to traditional brokerage models. Smaller cloud-based firms may vary in this aspect.</li>\n<li>Brand Appeal: Major cloud-based models boast significant and growing brand appeal, which may not be as pronounced among smaller ones.</li>\n<li>Real Estate Agent Commission Rate Flexibility: Many cloud-based models offer significant flexibility in what rate agents can charge clients providing more ways for agents to attract business.</li>\n<li>Brand Flexibility: Agents in cloud-based models have the freedom to build their personal brands.</li>\n<li>Transparent Real Estate Agent Commission Splits: While often not flexible, real estate agent commission splits in cloud-based models are transparent, more lucrative, and more equal across agents.</li>\n<li>Low Fees: These models typically have lower brokerage expenses, resulting in reduced fees for agents.</li>\n<li>Value Enhancement: Large cloud-based brokerages can leverage higher profits earned, by not maintaining offices, to innovate and enhance agents&#8217; businesses. They also wield influence in negotiating better deals with vendors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Disadvantages of Cloud-Based Models:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less-Recognized Brands for Small Firms: Smaller cloud-based firms may struggle with lesser brand recognition.</li>\n<li>Not Feeling Connected: The absence of physical offices can lead to agents feeling disconnected from their colleagues.  Some cloud-based brokerages offer solutions to this disadvantage with the additional camaraderie that sponsorship teams can offer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"external-factors-affecting-real-estate-agent-commission-rates\">External Factors Affecting Real Estate Agent Commission Rates</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4332\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/948c6d9dada7cef8-9-1.webp/public\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"362\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-1.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-1-300x109.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/9-1-768x278.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve explored the nuances of real estate agent commission splits and the value agents receive from brokerages, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the external factors that can significantly impact real estate agents&#8217; earning potential.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Property Value:</strong> The price of the property plays a pivotal role in an agent&#8217;s commission earnings. Higher-priced homes yield more substantial paychecks for agents. For instance, selling a $1 million property at a 3% commission results in a $30,000 commission, whereas a $500,000 property at the same rate earns $15,000.</p>\n<p>However, agents often adjust their commission rates for very high-priced homes, offering a reduced percentage due to similar effort requirements even though expenses are generally a bit higher for higher-priced homes.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Market Conditions:</strong> The health of the economy affects agent earnings. A robust economy with abundant buyers and sellers leads to more transactions and real estate agent commission.</p>\n<p>Conversely, recessions or limited buyer and seller activity often result in fewer transactions and earnings. Additionally, seasonal variations impact agent incomes.  For example, spring tends to result in more sales and higher prices.  Winter has the opposite effect.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Agent Experience:</strong> Experienced agents with years of expertise can confidently demand higher real estate agent commission rates. Conversely, newer agents may charge a lower commission rate as they establish themselves in the industry. They may also partner with experienced agents and share the commission.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Location Norms: </strong>Real estate agent commission rates vary across regions and types of locations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Regional Variations:</strong> Different parts of the United States have varying average commission rates, with some states and counties consistently having higher rates.</li>\n<li><strong>Urban vs. Rural:</strong> Commission rates often differ between urban and rural areas, often reflecting demand and cost of living. Rural areas may have lower rates.</li>\n<li><strong>Coastal vs. Inland:</strong> Coastal areas tend to have higher commission rates due to limited coastal property supply. In contrast, inland states may have lower rates, with some exceptions based on local home prices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding these external factors is essential for both real estate agents and clients, as they influence commission rates and the overall economics of real estate transactions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Navigating the maze of real estate agent commission doesn&#8217;t have to be daunting.
