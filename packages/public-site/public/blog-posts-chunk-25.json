And we all know that happier agents tend to be more successful agents.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why does profitability matter? Because a financially stable brokerage can keep offering you great tools, training, and support without cutting corners. When a brokerage is in the red, it\u2019s not uncommon for agents to feel the pinch.</p>\n<p><strong>Corcoran</strong> is part of Anywhere Real Estate, a large holding company that also includes brands like Sotheby\u2019s, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Century 21, and Coldwell Banker. As a group, Anywhere has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong> with <strong>12 quarters of profits</strong>, which leaves them with <strong>60% profitable </strong>quarters. While that\u2019s not terrible, it\u2019s not the most financially secure either.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>, which puts them at <strong>75% profitability</strong>. And here\u2019s the kicker\u2014<strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that\u2019s been profitable for the past five years</strong>.</p>\n<p>That financial stability means continued improvements for both agents and clients, with no surprises or cost-cutting moves that hurt your bottom line. If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>When it comes to commission splits, this is where agents often pay the most attention. After all, it\u2019s what determines how much of your hard-earned money stays in your pocket.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Corcoran</strong>, agents face some of the lowest commission splits in the industry, with splits ranging from <strong>50/50</strong> &#8211; <strong>70/30</strong>. For those unfamiliar with splits, this means you could be giving half of your commission back to the brokerage, depending on the deal you negotiate. It ties with Douglas Elliman for one of the lowest splits out there.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> offers one of the most agent-friendly commission structures in the industry. All agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you\u2019ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage for the year, you cap and move to <strong>100% commission</strong>\u2014meaning everything after that is yours to keep.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp rewards agents with stock for hitting certain milestones, and if you meet even more goals, you can get your <strong>$16,000 cap</strong> <strong>back</strong> in company stock. Bottom line, eXp Agents can earn more than 100% of their commission and it\u2019s transparent and the same for every agent, no matter their location or experience.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about E&#038;O insurance, which is critical for protecting both you and your brokerage from legal claims. At <strong>Corcoran</strong>, it\u2019s tough to get specifics on E&#038;O insurance. Agents have described it as <strong>\u201chigh,\u201d</strong> so it\u2019s worth checking with your local office to find out what you\u2019ll be expected to pay.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> makes <strong>E&#038;O insurance</strong> easy and affordable. You pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but only when you close a deal. And once you hit <strong>$750</strong> for the year, <strong>you\u2019re capped</strong> and done paying for E&#038;O. That\u2019s a huge relief for agents, especially if you\u2019re just starting out and don\u2019t want to deal with big upfront fees before you\u2019ve even closed your first deal.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Fees</h2>\n<p>Next up, let\u2019s dive into <strong>fees</strong>, because no one wants to be surprised by extra costs that eat into their earnings. At <strong>Corcoran</strong>, <strong>monthly fees vary</strong> significantly by office, and agents also pay a <strong>6% royalty fee per transaction</strong>. That royalty fee adds up quickly and can really cut into your commission.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong>, on the other hand, keeps things straightforward. Agents pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until they hit their cap. The simplicity and predictability of these fees make eXp Realty a much more cost-effective choice for agents.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a new agent or a seasoned pro, having access to the right <strong>training and support</strong> is critical to your success. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training is top-notch. You get access to <strong>over 50 live training sessions</strong> every week, as well as an <strong>on-demand library</strong> full of helpful resources.</p>\n<p>Plus, new agents can take part in the <strong>Fast Start</strong> program to get up and running quickly, while experienced agents can level up with the <strong>Kick Start</strong> program. And with <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong>, you\u2019ll never be left without help when you need it.</p>\n<p>Over at <strong>Corcoran</strong>, training and support <strong>vary by office</strong>. The level of support you receive depends heavily on your local broker, so if you\u2019re in an office with less training or a less available broker, you may find yourself without the resources you need when it counts.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Corcoran: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>technology and resources</strong>, staying ahead of the curve can be a game-changer for agents. <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is all about leveraging tech to give agents the best tools.</p>\n<p>As a <strong>fully virtual brokerage</strong>, eXp agents can do everything online, from meeting with their broker to attending training sessions. The <strong>eXp World</strong> platform is like a metaverse for agents, allowing them to collaborate and work together in real time. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>On top of that, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> provides each agent with their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a powerful <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a marketing center filled with customizable templates for social media, flyers, and more.</p>\n<p>Details on <strong>Corcoran\u2019s tech</strong> offerings are a bit more elusive. While they\u2019ve built a solid brand, especially in luxury real estate, there\u2019s no clear information on whether they offer the same kind of comprehensive tech tools that <strong>eXp Realty</strong> does. If cutting-edge technology is a must-have for you, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> seems to be the better bet.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-corcoran-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Corcoran May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s be real\u2014Corcoran does have a lot to offer, especially if you\u2019re an agent who prefers working in an office and enjoys having a nearby person to check up on you and make sure you\u2019re on track.\u00a0 In that case, your local Corcoran office might feel like home.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, if it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t want to work at home, <strong>eXp Realty does offer FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide. </strong>But, if you\u2019re the type who needs daily interaction and face-to-face accountability to stay on track, eXp\u2019s virtual model might not be the best fit for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp\u2019s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don\u2019t provide. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents\u2014how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s eXp\u2019s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp\u2019s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there\u2019s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp.

We\u2019re digging into 8 publicly traded real estate brokerage stocks\u2014that\u2019s roughly 15 well-known companies wrapped up into 3 different business models. Yeah, it\u2019s a lot.

It\u2019s about performance\u2014real-world, boots-on-the-ground results. We\u2019re looking at how these brokerages held up before COVID, during the absolute chaos of the 2021\u20132022 buying frenzy, and through the market slump that followed.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"501\" height=\"271\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Supercharge-Your-Marketing-No-Tech-Skills-Needed.webp\" alt=\"Supercharge Your Marketing (No Tech Skills Needed)\" class=\"wp-image-266618 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Supercharge-Your-Marketing-No-Tech-Skills-Needed.webp 501w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Supercharge-Your-Marketing-No-Tech-Skills-Needed-300x162.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<p>By focusing on the past five years of balance sheets, not crystal balls or analyst daydreams, we\u2019ll show you which top real estate companies are actually built to last. Because at the end of the day, profitability isn\u2019t just a flex\u2014it directly impacts your wallet, your tools, and your future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"real-estate-brokerage-profitability\">Real Estate Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Here\u2019s why profitability matters: broke brokerages break agents. Period. If your brokerage isn\u2019t turning a profit, it won\u2019t take long before the pain trickles down to you.</p>\n<p>Resources &#038; Tools? Nope. When the money\u2019s not there, neither are the upgrades. That shiny CRM or slick marketing platform? Yeah, you can forget about it.</p>\n<p>Stability? Don\u2019t count on it. Unprofitable brokerages are more likely to shut down, rebrand, or throw you into some clunky system mid-transaction while they scramble to stay afloat. Nothing says \u201cconfidence killer\u201d like telling a client your brokerage just laid off half its staff.</p>\n<p>Your Commission? At risk. A brokerage that\u2019s bleeding cash only has a few plays: jack up agent fees, slash your split, or both. Why? Because agents are the revenue.

Let\u2019s break down the four main types of real estate brokerage companies shaking up the scene:</p>\n<p><strong>Traditional brokerages</strong> are your classic franchise operations\u2014brick-and-mortar offices, lots of middle managers, and a whole recruitment hierarchy that screams \u201ccorporate.\u201d Think Coldwell Banker or Century 21. Reliable? Maybe. Efficient? Not so much.</p>\n<p><strong>Discount traditional brokerages</strong> are the same setup, just with thinner margins. Lower prices for clients mean thinner commissions for you. Yay?</p>\n<p><strong>Hybrid brokerages</strong> blend traditional setups with modern tech tools. You\u2019ll still find offices and regional managers, but they\u2019re at least trying to bring costs down with digital platforms and smarter systems. Compass is a good example here\u2014trying to play both sides.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud-based brokerages</strong> are the disruptors. No offices. No bloated staff. No middlemen taking a cut before you see your commission. These lean, tech-driven models\u2014like eXp Realty, Fathom, and Real\u2014use virtual tools and smart systems to cut expenses and boost agent value. When done right, they can offer high splits, low fees, and way more reinvestment into agent tools. For a deeper look at the advantages of modern models like eXp, check out what <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/brokerage-fee/\">eXp agents get for their brokerage fees</a>.</p>\n<p>Bottom line? The most profitable real estate brokerage is usually the one that figured out how to stop lighting money on fire just to keep the lights on.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-comparison-selection\">Brokerage Comparison Selection</h2>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s talk about how we picked our players. We\u2019re only looking at top real estate brokerages in the USA that are publicly traded. Why?

That\u2019s right, 100% unprofitable over five years.</p>\n<p>Now, Real does have one thing going for it: it\u2019s smaller.

But before you breathe a sigh of relief\u2014don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>While Compass started off with massive losses that <em>might</em> be shrinking, Real did the opposite. Their losses started small and snowballed into a full-on disaster. And while things <em>may</em> be stabilizing a bit, the trend hasn\u2019t exactly turned the corner.</p>\n<p>So far, Real\u2019s financial strategy looks like: \u201cLet\u2019s burn through capital, hope for hockey stick growth, and figure out profit\u2026 later?\u201d Bold.

These brokerages have been through it all\u2014a so-so market, a red-hot frenzy, and the post-boom slump. That\u2019s a rare, beautiful mess of data\u2014and it tells us a lot about which models bend and which ones break.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-new-wave-of-chaos\">A New Wave of Chaos</h3>\n<p>But now, every brokerage\u2014profitable or not\u2014is staring down a new challenge: the NAR settlement. With buyers and sellers more likely to DIY their transactions, and buyer agent commissions under a magnifying glass, we\u2019re probably looking at fewer deals and tighter margins, especially for newer agents.</p>\n<p>This matters a lot depending on how your brokerage earns its keep.</p>\n<p>No cap? No cushion. Brokerages that rely on collecting a cut from every single transaction are about to feel the squeeze. Meanwhile, those with agent commission caps\u2014like eXp Realty\u2019s $16,000 yearly cap\u2014have some insulation. Once an agent hits the cap, eXp doesn\u2019t milk every future deal; just small admin fees. And yet, despite giving agents more, eXp still manages to be the only net profitable brokerage. Go figure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"traditional-trouble-ahead\">Traditional Trouble Ahead</h3>\n<p>Traditional brokerages are looking at a much shakier future. Between franchise fees, physical offices, and layers of bloated staffing, their cost structure reads like a 2005 business plan. These expenses don\u2019t do much for agents\u2014but they sure eat up revenue.</p>\n<p>Compare that to cloud-based brokerages: lower costs, higher splits for agents, and more financial runway to actually invest in useful tools. And yes, many still offer optional physical spaces when needed. The math just makes more sense.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"are-we-at-the-blockbuster-moment\">Are We at the Blockbuster Moment?</h3>\n<p>We might be creeping toward a real turning point. As more agents jump to leaner, cloud-based brokerages, traditional models could struggle to cover their overhead. And when that happens, the usual moves kick in: higher agent fees, lower splits, and a mass agent exodus that\u2019s hard to come back from.\u00a0 Check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDyaO7XkjQI&#038;t=31s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anonymous agent reviews</a> and you can see agent complaints are already in high gear.</p>\n<p>It won\u2019t happen overnight (remember Blockbuster?). But eventually, the industry catches on\u2014and once it does, there\u2019s no going back to late fees and laminated folders.</p>\n<p>That said, not every cloud-based model is a guaranteed win either. As we\u2019ve seen, even tech-forward brokerages can crash if their math doesn\u2019t work. If the fees and splits don\u2019t support profitability, they\u2019ll face the same fate: rising costs for agents, less innovation, and fewer tools to help you win clients.</p>\n<p>Bad math is still bad math. More agents just make it louder.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"it-gets-better-what-the-most-successful-real-estate-company-smart-agent-alliance-offer-you\">It Gets Better &#8211; What the Most Successful Real Estate Company + Smart Agent Alliance Offer You</h2>\n<p>The bottom line?

Solid, but not groundbreaking. That\u2019s a dead-last agent ranking!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents consistently praise the tech, culture, and brand recognition\u2014especially in luxury markets. The tools are sleek, the vibe is collaborative, and the Compass name does some heavy lifting with clients. Leadership and support also get a thumbs up, and agents like the freedom to manage their own schedules (although that exists at pretty much every brokerage).</p>\n<p>But before you get too cozy, here\u2019s the part that doesn\u2019t show up on Glassdoor: Compass is the least profitable brokerage among all publicly traded firms. Yep\u2014again, <em>dead last</em>. We break down the earnings disaster in our <u>blog on brokerage profitability</u>, but spoiler: even the branding can\u2019t cover that kind of red ink.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-compass-cons-when-the-aesthetic-doesnt-pay-the-bills\">The Compass Cons: When the Aesthetic Doesn\u2019t Pay the Bills</h3>\n<p>Now for the part that <em>really</em> matters: the stuff agents complain about when no one from management is listening. Compass may get points for polish, but the real estate agent reviews make it clear\u2014there are cracks behind the clean branding.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what\u2019s consistently rubbing agents the wrong way:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Fees and Rough Commission Splits</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Compass isn\u2019t cheap to hang your license. Agents frequently mention hefty monthly fees, confusing commission structures, and extra per-transaction costs that add up fast\u2014especially for those not consistently closing deals. One agent put it bluntly: <em>\u201cLow split, then another 3% per deal? That\u2019s annoying.\u201d</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>No Leads, No Problem? Actually\u2026 It\u2019s a Problem.</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The brokerage may provide sleek tools, but the leads? Not so much. Reviews repeatedly call out the complete lack of company-generated business. Several agents said flat-out: <em>\u201cThey don\u2019t provide leads.\u201d</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>High Pressure, Low Warm Fuzzies</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Many reviews describe Compass as competitive and cutthroat\u2014fine if you thrive on 24/7 hustle, less ideal if you were hoping for work-life balance. One agent described it as, <em>\u201cJust like every other brokerage that swears they\u2019re the best.\u201d</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Team or Bust</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Compass leans heavily on a team-based structure, which can leave solo agents feeling lost in the shuffle. Multiple reviews say that without a team, it\u2019s hard to gain traction\u2014and support from management feels nonexistent unless you&#8217;re already producing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Corporate Vibes, Minus the Warmth</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Despite the \u201ccool\u201d aesthetic, several agents described the office culture as cold and corporate. There\u2019s a sense that higher-ups stay distant and agents can easily feel like just another headcount. One review summed it up: <em>\u201cBig company, low commission\u2014get lost in the crowd.\u201d</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So while Compass earns its spot among the top real estate brokerage companies by name recognition and flash, the agent reviews suggest a different story: great surface-level shine, but some serious internal growing pains. If you\u2019re not already a top producer with a team, the costs might just outweigh the perks.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"redfin-structure-salary-and-a-side-of-burnout\">Redfin \u2013 Structure, Salary, and a Side of Burnout</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Redfin-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Redfin Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239649 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Redfin earns a 3.6 rating with 65% of agents recommending it to a friend and 79% approving of the CEO.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Redfin\u2019s model is different from most of the top real estate brokerage companies. It\u2019s not your typical 1099 commission-only gig. Agents often receive a base salary, benefits, and enjoy a collaborative team culture, making it feel more like a W-2 job with corporate perks.\u00a0 Agents who like structure and teamwork tend to feel at home at Redfin. Reviews frequently highlight a collaborative culture, supportive coworkers, and management that doesn\u2019t ghost you when things get tough. The ability to work from home, enjoy a flexible(ish) schedule, and earn a base salary with benefits gives it a corporate vibe\u2014but in a way that some agents actually appreciate. And while the tech can be a lot, agents do give Redfin props for keeping things organized and efficient\u2014at least when it\u2019s working.</p>\n<p>It sounds like a dream setup\u2014until you scroll past the star ratings and into the actual complaints.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-redfin-cons-salary-stability-comes-at-a-cost\">The Redfin Cons: Salary Stability Comes at a Cost</h3>\n<p>If Redfin feels more like a corporate job, that\u2019s because\u2026 it kind of is. And the <strong>real estate agent reviews</strong> make it clear that stability often comes with strings.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commission Caps &#038; Pay Frustration</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Many agents say the income potential just doesn\u2019t cut it. While the base salary is nice for consistency, the commission structure is limited, and some agents feel they\u2019re leaving money on the table compared to more traditional brokerages.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Weekend Burnout Is Real</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Agents love the \u201cflexibility\u201d\u2014until they realize it includes working most weekends and juggling a non-stop client load. Reviews call out a lack of real work-life balance due to the heavy volume and rigid expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Clogged Career Paths</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Looking to move up? Not so fast. Many agents feel like they hit a ceiling quickly, with few opportunities to advance or grow inside the company.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Too Many Clients, Too Little Time</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>That structured lead system? It can flood agents with more customers than they can handle, leading to burnout and customer service fatigue. As one review put it: <em>\u201cGreat place to start, exhausting to maintain.\u201d</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Technology Overwhelm</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Yes, Redfin has tech\u2014but some agents say it&#8217;s overkill. The systems are clunky, CRMs could be better, and the constant updates can be more frustrating than helpful.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if you\u2019re someone who likes structure, salary, and teamwork, Redfin could feel like the best real estate brokerage for your needs. But if you&#8217;re after uncapped income, flexible growth, and control over your schedule, you may want to read between the lines\u2014because these real estate reviews show that consistency comes at a cost.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"douglas-elliman-prestige-perks-and-a-few-cracks-in-the-foundation\">Douglas Elliman \u2013 Prestige, Perks, and a Few Cracks in the Foundation</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:15% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Douglas-Elliman-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Douglas Elliman Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239643 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Douglas Elliman pulls a 3.8 with 67% of agents saying they\u2019d recommend it to a friend, and a solid 88% CEO approval rating.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents rave about the brand prestige, strong training and support, and an office culture that leans collaborative. The company\u2019s long-standing presence in luxury markets brings a level of clout that newer brokerages can\u2019t fake. Add in a flexible schedule, a stash of resources, and seasoned leadership (depending on the office), and Douglas Elliman has its perks\u2014especially if you\u2019re newer and want exposure in high-end real estate.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-douglas-elliman-cons-fancy-brand-familiar-problems\">The Douglas Elliman Cons: Fancy Brand, Familiar Problems</h3>\n<p>As far as top real estate brokerage companies go, Douglas Elliman gets respect\u2014but not without its share of classic big-brokerage baggage.</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Commission-Only Pay (and It\u2019s Not Cheap to Stay)</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Like many traditional brokerages, Elliman is 100% commission-based\u2014so you eat what you kill. Agents also say the splits and monthly fees are steep, making it tough to get ahead unless you\u2019re already producing at a high level. <em>\u201cThere\u2019s a price to pay for the resources,\u201d</em> one review noted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Competitive &#038; Hierarchical Vibes</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Some offices feel like a team, others feel like high school\u2014complete with cliques and top-producer favoritism. It\u2019s a sink-or-swim environment where newer agents can easily feel sidelined.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Support Isn\u2019t Always Consistent</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Support varies widely by office and manager. While some managers are all-in, others are checked out\u2014and if you don\u2019t speak up or push for help, you may be left to figure it all out on your own.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Outdated Tech and Clunky Tools</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Despite the brokerage\u2019s luxury positioning, the technology doesn\u2019t always match.

Reviews mention inconsistent support, unclear expectations, and office politics that get in the way of productivity.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line? Douglas Elliman may be one of the top real estate brokers in the USA, but agents want the backend to match the brand. If you\u2019re an experienced agent with a strong book of business and a taste for prestige, it could be a solid fit.

Not Really a Thing Here</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Multiple reviews say leads are sparse\u2014and when they do come, they\u2019re low-budget rentals or dead-end deals.

You\u2019re on Your Own.</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unless you\u2019re on a team or in a high-volume office, don\u2019t expect leads to rain from the sky.

Depends on Your Definition</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Real estate is demanding, sure\u2014but agents here say the workload and weekend grind can make balance feel impossible.

If you want structure, mentorship, and a company that still values relationship-building over buzzwords, it might be a good launchpad.

Good Luck Out There.</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Unless you\u2019ve got a mentor lined up or a lead-generating sidekick, support for new agents is hit-or-miss, and leads aren\u2019t exactly being handed out like open house flyers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Real Estate = Real Burnout</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>While flexibility is praised, the reality is many agents feel overworked and on call 24/7, with weekends and evenings regularly sacrificed on the altar of client convenience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Self-Starter Required</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You\u2019ll hear it in nearly every <em>real estate brokerage review</em>: success here means being relentlessly self-motivated.

The vibe isn\u2019t always inclusive, and agents feel it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, is Berkshire Hathaway one of the top 10 brokerage firms worth joining? If you\u2019re organized, tech-savvy, and ready to make your own leads work harder than your commission split\u2014yes. But if you\u2019re expecting endless hand-holding and free leads, it may feel less like a financial powerhouse and more like a luxury label with an expensive price tag.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sothebys-luxury-brand-high-standards-and-youd-better-show-up-ready\">Sotheby\u2019s \u2013 Luxury Brand, High Standards, and You\u2019d Better Show Up Ready</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:16% auto\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"113\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sothebys-International-Realty-Logo.webp\" alt=\"Sotheby&#039;s International Realty Logo\" class=\"wp-image-239651 size-full\" title=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Sotheby\u2019s clocks in at a strong 4.3 rating where 74% would recommend it, and 89% give the CEO the thumbs up.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Agents love the global brand recognition, which comes with serious clout for landing luxury clients.

It\u2019s not free. Agents mention steep commission splits and royalty fees, with one calling out the 6% branding tax as a bitter pill to swallow. Oh, and tack on hefty E&#038;O fees while you\u2019re at it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Saturated Markets = Fierce Competition</strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Want to break into luxury?

Because if a brokerage is financially stable, it\u2019s more likely to keep investing in its agents by offering better tools, more training, and stronger support. A struggling brokerage might start making decisions that hurt its agents, like cutting commissions or adding new fees.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about <strong>Douglas Elliman\u2019s</strong> profitability. They\u2019ve posted <strong>13 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>7 quarters of losses</strong>, meaning they have a <strong>46% profitability </strong>rate. Not the strongest track record.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with only 5 quarters of losses,\u2014giving them a <strong>75% profitability</strong> rate. Even better<strong>, eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that\u2019s been profitable for the last five years.</strong></p>\n<p>That financial stability means <strong>continuous improvements</strong> for agents and clients without sudden changes that hurt your bottom line.

This wide variation makes it hard to predict exactly how much you\u2019ll keep and how long it\u2019ll take to cap, so make sure to ask for specifics during your interview.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, it\u2019s straightforward and agent-friendly. Every agent starts with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you\u2019ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission.</strong> Plus, eXp rewards agents with <strong>company stock</strong> for hitting certain milestones.</p>\n<p>If you meet additional goals after capping, you can even get your <strong>$16,000 cap back in stock</strong>. At the end of the year, these agents will have earned more than 100% of their commission.</p>\n<p>And with <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, every agent gets the same deal, whether you\u2019re new to the game or a seasoned top producer. No negotiations are needed, and you know exactly what you\u2019re getting from day one.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Douglas Elliman: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>When it comes to Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance, this is where the details matter. Unfortunately, <strong>Douglas Elliman</strong> doesn\u2019t provide much information on this, and agents are told to <strong>check </strong>with their<strong> local offices</strong>. Depending on your location, these fees could be significant, so make sure to clarify before signing up.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the E&#038;O insurance is easy to understand. Agents only pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but once you hit <strong>$750 </strong>for the year, <strong>you\u2019re done</strong>. No more E&#038;O payments, no matter how many deals you close. This is a great setup for agents who want to avoid heavy upfront costs and only pay when they\u2019re actually making money.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Douglas Elliman: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really eat into your earnings, so let\u2019s break down what each brokerage charges. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay a predictable <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and <strong>$25 per transaction</strong> until they hit their cap. It\u2019s simple, straightforward, and budget-friendly.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Douglas Elliman</strong>, <strong>fees vary by office</strong>, and agents are also subject to a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> per transaction. This means you\u2019re paying a percentage of every deal, which can quickly add up, especially when combined with office fees.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Douglas Elliman: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>When it comes to training and support, you need a brokerage that\u2019s got your back, whether you\u2019re just starting out or looking to take your business to the next level.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training and support are top-notch. They offer over <strong>50 live training sessions every week</strong>, plus an extensive <strong>on-demand course library</strong>. New agents can jump into the <strong>Fast Start</strong> <strong>program</strong>, designed to help them start earning quickly, while more experienced agents can benefit from <strong>Kick Start program</strong> to level up their business.</p>\n<p>On top of that, eXp provides <strong>24/7 support</strong> and has over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> ready to help out when you need it.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Douglas Elliman</strong>, <strong>training and support can vary widely</strong> depending on the office. Some locations might offer great resources, while others may not provide much at all. The inconsistency means that your experience could be very different depending on where you work.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Douglas Elliman: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In today\u2019s real estate world, technology is critical, and having the right tools can make all the difference.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, technology is a strong point. eXp is a fully virtual brokerage, and everything is done online through <strong>eXp World</strong>\u2014from broker meetings to training sessions to client collaboration.

And the best part? eXp constantly updates and adds new tools to help agents stay ahead of the curve.</p>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>Douglas Elliman</strong>, we couldn\u2019t find much concrete information about the tech they offer agents. While there may be resources available, it\u2019s <strong>unclear</strong> if there\u2019s a standard set of tools across all offices. If you rely heavily on cutting-edge technology to run your business, eXp Realty\u2019s setup gives you a clear advantage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-douglas-elliman-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Douglas Elliman May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re someone who prefers a traditional brokerage model with physical offices and enjoys face-to-face interactions, then Douglas Elliman could be a better fit.

Why should you care? Because a financially stable brokerage is more likely to invest in its agents, offering better tools, support, and opportunities.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at <strong>The Agency</strong>. Unfortunately, <strong>they don\u2019t have publicly listed stock</strong>, so their profitability isn\u2019t transparent. This leaves you in the dark about how well the company is doing financially, which is something to keep in mind when considering the long-term stability of the brokerage.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with <strong>15 profitable quarters</strong>\u2014meaning they\u2019ve been <strong>profitable 75% of the time</strong>. Even better, <strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that\u2019s been profitable for the last five years</strong>.</p>\n<p>This financial stability translates into continuous improvements for both agents and clients, ensuring you have access to cutting-edge tools, tech, and support without worrying about surprise changes that could affect your income.

At <strong>The Agency</strong>, splits typically range from <strong>70/30</strong> to <strong>90/10.</strong> Like many traditional brokerages, it depends on the office and what deal you negotiate. So, you\u2019ll want to ask about this when you\u2019re interviewing.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, things are much simpler and transparent. Agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you\u2019ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp offers additional stock options for agents who hit specific milestones\u2014meaning you can actually earn <strong>more than 100% commission </strong>each year. For new agents or seasoned pros, everyone at eXp Realty gets the same deal, no haggling required.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is a must-have for protecting both agents and the brokerage from legal claims. Let\u2019s see how the costs compare between eXp Realty and The Agency.</p>\n<p>At <strong>The Agency</strong>, agents are charged <strong>$1,900</strong> <strong>annually</strong> for E&#038;O insurance, and from what we\u2019ve gathered, this fee is often due upfront, even before you\u2019ve closed any deals.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the E&#038;O insurance structure is more agent-friendly. Agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and once you hit <strong>$750</strong> in total for the year, you don\u2019t pay anything more\u2014no matter how many deals you close.</p>\n<p>This setup is much easier on your budget, especially if you\u2019re just starting out and don\u2019t want to pay hefty fees before making any money.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really take a bite out of your earnings, so let\u2019s break down the costs at eXp Realty and The Agency. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, you\u2019ll pay a manageable <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong>, plus a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until you hit your cap. That\u2019s it\u2014clear and simple.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>The Agency</strong> has fees that <strong>vary by office</strong>. Monthly fees can fluctuate significantly, and on top of that, there\u2019s a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> charged on each transaction. These fees can add up quickly, especially when combined with commission splits, so make sure to ask about the specifics at your local office.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs The Agency: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>When it comes to <strong>training</strong> and <strong>support</strong>, the quality and availability can make a huge difference in your career, whether you\u2019re a brand-new agent or a seasoned pro.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> excels in this area, offering more than <strong>50 live training sessions each week</strong>, along with a robust <strong>on-demand course library</strong>.</p>\n<p>For new agents, the <strong>Fast Start</strong> <strong>program</strong> helps you get up to speed quickly, while the <strong>Kick Start</strong> <strong>program</strong> is designed to take experienced agents to the next level. Plus, eXp Realty offers <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> available to help when you need it.</p>\n<p>At <strong>The Agency</strong>, training and support <strong>vary by office</strong>. Some locations offer more resources than others, but there\u2019s no consistent standard.</p>\n<p>The same goes for support\u2014your experience will largely <strong>depend on your local broker\u2019s availability</strong>, which can be a drawback if you need help outside of regular business hours.

A financially stable brokerage is less likely to make sudden changes that could hurt your business.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices is one of the many companies under the <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Berkshire Hathaway umbrella</a>. However, we can\u2019t find any broken out financial performance of the HomeServices division in Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s public filings. So while Berkshire Hathaway as a whole is profitable, we don\u2019t know whether HomeServices itself is generating a profit or running at a loss.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 15 profitable quarters, putting them at <strong>75% profitability</strong>. And even better\u2014<strong>eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that\u2019s been profitable for the last five years.</strong></p>\n<p>That kind of financial stability leads to continuous improvements for agents and clients alike.

At\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway, commission splits range from\u00a060/40\u00a0to\u00a093/7.\u00a0This is often negotiated between the agent and office, so it\u2019s important to ask for specifics during your interview.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the commission splits are refreshingly simple and transparent. Agents start with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you\u2019ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage in a year, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>And with eXp, there\u2019s no negotiation or confusion\u2014every agent gets the same deal. Plus, eXp offers stock options for agents who hit certain milestones, so you can actually earn <strong>more than 100%</strong> of your commissions each year. Whether you\u2019re a new agent or a top producer, the playing field is level at eXp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Now let\u2019s talk about <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/errors-omissions-eo-insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance</a>. This is crucial for protecting both you and your brokerage from potential legal claims.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, the details about E&#038;O insurance are not widely shared, and it seems to <strong>vary by office</strong>. From what we\u2019ve gathered, these costs can be substantial, so you\u2019ll want to check with your local office to understand what you\u2019ll be expected to pay.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and once you hit <strong>$750</strong> for the year, your E&#038;O fees stop. No more payments, no matter how many deals you close. This is a huge advantage, especially if you\u2019re just starting out or want to keep more of your income in your pocket.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees can really add up, so let\u2019s break down what to expect from eXp Realty and Berkshire Hathaway. At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents pay a straightforward <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong>, and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until you hit your cap. Pretty simple, right?</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, things are more complicated. Monthly fees can range from <strong>$295 to</strong> <strong>$625</strong> per transaction, depending on your office. Plus, there\u2019s a <strong>6% royalty fee</strong> on each transaction, which can really start to add up. When you compare the two, eXp Realty offers a more predictable and cost-effective fee structure, which helps agents keep more of their earnings.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Training and support are key for both new agents and seasoned pros. Let\u2019s see how these brokerages stack up. At\u00a0<a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/training\">eXp Realty</a>, you\u2019ll have access to over\u00a050 live training sessions every week, along with a massive\u00a0on-demand library of courses.</p>\n<p>For new agents, the <strong>Fast Start program</strong> is designed to help you hit the ground running, while experienced agents can level up with the <strong>Kick Start program</strong>. And with <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff</strong> members available to assist you, you\u2019re never left hanging when you need help.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, the training and support<strong> vary by office</strong>. Some offices might offer great resources, while others could leave you wanting more. Your experience will largely depend on your local office broker\u2019s availability, which means you might not always have the support you need at crucial moments.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>Having the right technology can make or break your real estate business, so let\u2019s see how eXp Realty and Berkshire Hathaway compare.</p>\n<p>eXp Realty\u00a0is at the forefront of tech innovation with its fully virtual brokerage model. Agents work in\u00a0eXp World, a metaverse-like platform where you can meet with brokers, get tech support, and attend training sessions. Want the full scoop? Check out our\u00a0<a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/exp-world\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp Realty provides agents with a personal <strong>IDX website</strong>, not just a page on your brokerage\u2019s website, a powerful <strong>CRM &#038; Lead Generator Tool</strong>, a <strong>Marketing Center</strong> filled with customizable templates and social media content, and more. And with eXp, the tech keeps evolving to help you stay ahead of the competition.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, we found <strong>no information</strong> about their technology and resources. Not sure why, but it seems like a bad thing that no one is talking about it. If having access to cutting-edge tools and resources is crucial to your success, eXp Realty is the clear leader here.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-berkshire-hathaway-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Berkshire Hathaway May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>While eXp Realty offers tons of benefits, Berkshire Hathaway may be the better fit if you prefer a traditional brokerage with physical offices. If you enjoy the structure of an office environment or need to have a local broker for face-to-face support and to crack the whip to get you moving, Berkshire Hathaway could be the right place for you.</p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re just looking for out-of-home office space, eXp Realty provides FREE access\u00a0to over <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/offices\">4,000 Regus office business lounges</a> around the world. But if you thrive in a more structured setting with daily in-person accountability, Berkshire Hathaway might feel more like home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp\u2019s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>On top of everything else, eXp Realty offers a range of features that most other brokerages simply don\u2019t. For luxury agents, <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/luxury\">eXp\u2019s\u00a0Luxury Division\u00a0</a>allows you to advertise your high-end listings globally, giving you top-tier exposure.</p>\n<p>They also have a dedicated staff called<a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenous-leads\">\u00a0Revenos</a>, whose sole job is to find and provide quality leads directly to eXp agents\u2014how cool is that?

But your brokerage also shapes your day-to-day experience, determines how much support you get, and dictates the resources you can access to grow your business. You need to choose a brokerage that helps you succeed while ensuring your bottom line stays healthy.</p>\n<p>Today, we\u2019re comparing eXp Realty and Coldwell Banker\u2014two prominent names in real estate. We\u2019ll explore everything from commission splits and fees to the level of training and agent satisfaction at each brokerage.</p>\n<p>With eXp Realty, all the information is easily accessible, but with Coldwell Banker, we had to do some digging to find out what agents experience.

According to Glassdoor, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands strong with a <strong>4.6-star rating</strong>, while <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> also holds up well with a <strong>4.3-star rating</strong>. These ratings give a snapshot of how agents feel about the support, resources, and overall experience at each company.</p>\n<p>And as we all know, agents who are satisfied with their brokerage tend to be more successful. \u00a0If you\u2019re curious about how the top real estate firms stack up, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\"><em><strong>&#8220;12 Insider Picks for the Best Real Estate Brokerage in 2024!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a> Spoiler alert: <strong>eXp Realty ranks #1</strong> on Glassdoor.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"brokerage-profitability\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248037\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp\" alt=\"a green arrow with a coin and a gold coin\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brokerage-Profitability-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Brokerage Profitability</h2>\n<p>Why should you care if your brokerage is making money? Because a profitable brokerage has the financial stability to offer better tools, resources, and fewer surprise changes that could hurt you or your clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> is part of Anywhere Real Estate, which also owns big names like Sotheby\u2019s, Better Homes &#038; Gardens, Century 21, and Corcoran. Anywhere has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with 8 unprofitable quarters. That gives it a <strong>60% profitability</strong> rate\u2014not bad, but there\u2019s definitely room for improvement.</p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s look at <strong>eXp Realty</strong>. They\u2019ve posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, and 15 of those have been profitable, giving them a <strong>75% profitability</strong> rate. What\u2019s more, eXp Realty is the only publicly traded brokerage that\u2019s been profitable over the past five years.</p>\n<p>That stability translates to continuous improvements for both agents and clients. When you work at a brokerage that\u2019s making money, they can afford to reinvest in their agents with better tools, training, and tech. If you want the full scoop on brokerage profitability, check out our blog <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em><strong>&#8220;Top Real Estate Companies That Might Go Under!&#8221;</strong></em>.</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248038\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp\" alt=\"a green and yellow pie chart\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Commission-Splits-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Commission Splits</h2>\n<p>Time to talk about commission splits\u2014probably the first thing most agents look at when comparing brokerages. <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> has a commission structure that varies widely depending on your office, location, and how you negotiate.</p>\n<p>Splits range from <strong>55/45 to 90/10</strong>, so that\u2019s 55% to you and 45% to the brokerage at the lower end of the spectrum. Our research shows that the actual numbers vary a lot, so make sure to ask for specifics when you interview.</p>\n<p>Now, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> is refreshingly simple. Every agent starts at an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you\u2019ve paid <strong>$16,000 to eXp</strong> in the year, you cap, meaning you keep <strong>100% </strong>of your commissions after that. There\u2019s no negotiating for a better split\u2014every agent gets the same deal, whether you\u2019re new or a seasoned pro.</p>\n<p>Plus, eXp offers opportunities to <strong>earn stock</strong>. You get company stock for hitting certain milestones, and if you hit additional goals after capping, you can earn your <strong>$16,000 cap back in stock</strong>. That\u2019s how some agents actually earn more than 100% of their commission each year. Nice!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eando-insurance\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248039\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp\" alt=\"a blue shield with a white check mark\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EO-Insurance-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: E&#038;O Insurance</h2>\n<p>Errors and Omissions (E&#038;O) insurance is a must-have for agents, but how brokerages handle this cost varies. At <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong>, agents pay around <strong>$300 per month</strong> for E&#038;O insurance. Whether that\u2019s upfront or paid over time depends on the office, but that\u2019s a significant cost no matter how you slice it.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, E&#038;O insurance is a lot more manageable. Agents only pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, and eXp caps those fees at <strong>$750</strong> annually. So once you\u2019ve paid $750 in E&#038;O for the year, you\u2019re done. You won\u2019t have to pay another penny, no matter how many deals you close. That\u2019s a huge benefit for agents who are just getting started and don\u2019t want to be burdened with hefty upfront costs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Fees</h2>\n<p>Fees are another critical consideration, and Coldwell Banker and eXp Realty handle them quite differently.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the fee structure is straightforward. Agents pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and <strong>$25 per transaction</strong> until they hit their cap. It\u2019s predictable, easy to understand, and there are no surprises.</p>\n<p><strong>Coldwell Banker\u2019s</strong> fees, however, vary greatly depending on the office. Agents can expect to pay between <strong>$122 &#8211; $350 per month</strong> just to stay on board, and there\u2019s also a <strong>5% to 6.5% royalty fee</strong> charged per transaction. These fees can really add up and take a bigger chunk out of your earnings compared to <strong>eXp\u2019s</strong> much simpler structure.</p>\n<p>Between the clear fee structure at eXp and the variable, sometimes high, costs at Coldwell Banker, eXp Realty definitely offers a more agent-friendly deal when it comes to fees.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Coldwell Banker: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Next up is training and support, which are crucial to helping agents, whether new or experienced, succeed.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, the training opportunities are top-notch. With over <strong>50 live training sessions every week</strong>, plus a full library of <strong>on-demand courses</strong>, there\u2019s always something to help you improve. eXp also has programs like <strong>Fast Start</strong> for new agents who want to get going fast, and <strong>Kick Start</strong> for experienced agents looking to take their business to the next level.</p>\n<p>On top of all that, eXp provides <strong>24/7 support</strong> and over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong> to assist you with your needs.</p>\n<p><strong>Coldwell Banker</strong>, on the other hand, <strong>doesn\u2019t offer a standardized training program</strong> across all offices. Training varies depending on where you\u2019re located and what your office offers. That\u2019s also true for agent support\u2014it\u2019s heavily reliant on the office broker, meaning your experience can vary depending on how available or helpful your broker is.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>When it comes to tech, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> stands out from the crowd.

Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>Beyond that, eXp agents get access to an <strong>IDX website</strong>, a <strong>CRM</strong> called <strong>kvCORE</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> with customizable templates, social media content, and more. eXp is constantly adding new tech tools to help agents stay ahead of the game.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t dig up too much information about what <strong>Coldwell Banker</strong> offers in terms of tech. It\u2019s <strong>unclear if they have any standard tools </strong>across offices, so ask about that during your Coldwell Banker interview.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-coldwell-banker-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Coldwell Banker May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re someone who likes a more traditional office environment with face-to-face interactions and you prefer having a local office broker for day-to-day support, Coldwell Banker could be a better fit. They\u2019ve got a long-standing reputation and strong branding, and for some agents, having that in-person accountability is key to their success.</p>\n<p>However, if you\u2019re just looking for out-of-home office space, <strong>eXp Realty provides FREE access to the 4,000 Regus office business lounges</strong> around the world. But that won\u2019t be enough if you\u2019re someone who needs the structure of a physical office, with a broker cracking the whip. If that\u2019s the case, Coldwell Banker might feel more like home.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\">eXp\u2019s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don\u2019t provide. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents\u2014how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s eXp\u2019s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp\u2019s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there\u2019s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. The best part? That income doesn\u2019t end when you retire and it\u2019s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you\u2019re no longer working. Now that\u2019s a win-win!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">That\u2019s a Wrap</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, when comparing eXp Realty and Coldwell Banker, it comes down to what kind of environment you thrive in. Coldwell Banker has the prestige of a traditional office setting, but with higher fees and less predictable splits, it might not be the most cost-effective option.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, eXp Realty offers transparent splits, lower fees, better tech, and 24/7 support\u2014all of which can help you keep more of your earnings and grow your business faster.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"join-our-free-team-at-exp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</h2>\n<p>Join the leading force in real estate with eXp Realty \u2013 the<span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/join-top-real-estate-brokerage-firms/\"><em>only</em><span>\u00a0</span>profitable publicly traded brokerage</a><span>\u00a0</span>over the past five years and holds the prestigious title of the<span>\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/best-real-estate-brokerage/\">best brokerage to work for</a>.

Because when a brokerage is profitable, it\u2019s more likely to invest in its agents\u2014offering better tools, support, and training.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at <strong>Redfin</strong>. With <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, Redfin has posted <strong>17 quarters of losses</strong>, meaning they\u2019ve only had <strong>15% profitability </strong>rate. Ouch. Financial instability like that often leads to cost-cutting measures that can hurt agents and their clients.</p>\n<p>In comparison, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> has posted <strong>20 quarters of earnings</strong>, with only <strong>5 quarters of losses</strong>, which gives them a <strong>75% profitability </strong>rate. And get this\u2014<strong>eXp Realty</strong> is the only publicly traded brokerage that\u2019s been profitable for the past five years.</p>\n<p>That kind of financial strength is a big deal because it means continuous improvements for both agents and clients, without cutting corners.

You can choose an <strong>up to 40/60 </strong>split and Redfin will provide your leads or an <strong>up to 75/25 </strong>split and you find your own leads.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear what situation results in a lower pay than 40/60 and 75/25, but clearly the words \u201cup to\u201d imply their splits can be lower. Anyway, these splits are fairly new as Redfin recently ended their model that paid agent salaries. We\u2019re guessing Redfin\u2019s low profitability motivated the change.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, it\u2019s straightforward. Every agent starts with an <strong>80/20 split</strong>, and once you\u2019ve paid <strong>$16,000</strong> to the brokerage, you move to <strong>100% commission</strong> for the rest of the year.</p>\n<p>Plus, <strong>eXp Realty</strong> rewards agents with stock for hitting certain milestones, and if you meet additional goals, you can even get your <strong>$16,000 cap back in company stock</strong>. That means agents can earn <strong>more than 100% commission</strong> each year.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fees\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248040\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp\" alt=\"a white paper clip with a dollar sign\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fees-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Fees</h2>\n<p><strong>Fees</strong> can eat into your earnings if you\u2019re not careful, so let\u2019s compare how they stack up between these two brokerages.</p>\n<p><strong>Redfin</strong> takes a different approach. Redfin takes a <strong>bigger bite out of your commission</strong> and covers your fees and some other business expenses that agents typically incur like MLS dues, association fees, mileage, cell phone plan, training, development, sales coaching, and more.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, you pay an <strong>$85 monthly fee</strong> and a <strong>$25 transaction fee</strong> per deal until you hit your cap. For E&#038;O insurance, you pay <strong>$60 per transaction</strong>, but only when you close a deal. And here\u2019s the best part\u2014once you hit <strong>$750</strong> for the year, you\u2019re done paying E&#038;O insurance.</p>\n<p>While eXp Realty does not cover all the fees that Redfin does, having a 80/20 split that goes up to 100% when you cap instead of Redfin\u2019s much lower splits leaves agents taking home more money. Plus, eXp agents do get all the training, development, sales coaching they could possibly need at no additional fee.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248042\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp\" alt=\"a purple and yellow toy light bulb and gears\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Training-and-Support-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Training and Support</h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re just starting out or a seasoned pro, training and support are crucial to your success. Let\u2019s see what each brokerage offers in this department.</p>\n<p>At <strong>eXp Realty</strong>, agents have access to <strong>50+ live training sessions every week</strong>, an <strong>on-demand library</strong>, and programs like <strong>Fast Start</strong> for new agents and <strong>Kick Start</strong> for experienced agents. Plus, you get <strong>24/7 support</strong> and help from over <strong>2,000 full-time staff members</strong>. That\u2019s a huge bonus because it means you\u2019re never left hanging when you need help.</p>\n<p><strong>Redfin</strong> offers <strong>4 weeks of local training</strong>, which is a decent start for new agents. However, beyond that initial training, the level of <strong>support varies</strong> depending on the office broker. So, if you need help outside of standard hours or want more ongoing training, you might find yourself waiting for someone to be available.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248041\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp\" alt=\"a white robot with blue text\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1.webp 290w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Technology-and-Resources-1-150x150.webp 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp Realty vs Redfin: Technology and Resources</h2>\n<p>In today\u2019s real estate world, having the right tech can make or break your business. Let\u2019s see how these two brokerages stack up in terms of technology and resources.</p>\n<p><strong>eXp Realty</strong> is known for being a fully virtual brokerage. With <strong>eXp World</strong>, agents can meet with their brokers, get tech support, attend training, and collaborate with other agents\u2014all in a metaverse-style environment. Want the full scoop? Check out our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-world-tour-newly-improved/\">blog on eXp World</a>!</p>\n<p>\u00a0On top of that, eXp Realty provides agents with their own <strong>IDX website</strong>, a powerful <strong>kvCORE CRM</strong>, and a <strong>marketing center</strong> with customizable templates for social media, flyers, and so much more.</p>\n<p>The details on <strong>Redfin</strong>\u2019s technology and resources are a bit harder to come by. They\u2019re known for their <strong>consumer-facing website</strong>, which is popular with buyers and sellers, but when it comes to tools for agents, it\u2019s not as clear. There\u2019s no virtual platform like eXp World, so if cutting-edge tech is something you value, eXp Realty is the better choice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-redfin-may-be-best-for-you\">Why Redfin May Be Best for You</h2>\n<p>While eXp Realty offers a ton of value, Redfin still has its appeal, especially if you\u2019re someone who values stability and enjoys a more traditional real estate model.</p>\n<p>Redfin\u2019s salary option offers consistency that might be appealing to agents who want a guaranteed paycheck, even if it comes with a lower commission split. Plus, if you prefer working in a more structured environment, where someone is in charge of keeping you on track, Redfin\u2019s office-based approach could be a better fit for you.</p>\n<p>That said, <strong>eXp Realty does provide FREE access to over 4,000 Regus office business lounges worldwide.</strong> But if you thrive on having a salaried position with a traditional brokerage structure, Redfin might be the better option for you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exps-exclusive-resources\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" class=\"wp-image-248129\" style=\"width: 80px;\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources.png\" alt=\"a yellow diamond on a white background\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources.png 256w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/eXps-Exclusive-Resources-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" /> eXp\u2019s Exclusive Resources</h2>\n<p>Beyond the usual offerings, eXp Realty has a few game-changing features that other brokerages simply don\u2019t have. eXp Realty has a <strong>luxury division</strong> with global advertising around the world. eXp Realty has a dedicated team, <strong>Revenos</strong>, whose entire mission is to find and deliver top-quality leads directly to eXp agents\u2014how great is that?</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s eXp\u2019s <strong>Referral tool</strong> that makes sending referrals to other agents effortless, and for those wanting to focus purely on referrals, eXp\u2019s<strong> Referral Division</strong> slashes costs while keeping you active in the industry. And, of course, there\u2019s <strong>Revenue Share</strong>, which lets you build extra income by bringing other agents into eXp. The best part? That income doesn\u2019t end when you retire and it\u2019s willable, so it continues to roll in even after you\u2019re no longer working.
