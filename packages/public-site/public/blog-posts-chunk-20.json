    "content": "<p>For real estate agents choosing between Fathom Realty and Sotheby’s International Realty, the decision often comes down to one pivotal question: is luxury branding really worth the price tag? On one side, you have Fathom’s clean-cut, 100% commission model that lets agents keep every dollar they earn. It&#8217;s a magnet for independent, cost-conscious agents who prioritize net income over brand name. On the other side is Sotheby’s—a legacy luxury brand that brings instant credibility but charges dearly for the privilege, with commission splits, franchise fees, and other costs that can siphon away 30 to 40 percent of your commission.</p>\n<p>But as the real estate industry evolves, more agents are questioning this binary choice. Why sacrifice profitability for branding or branding for autonomy when modern brokerages are starting to blend the best of both? In this breakdown, we’ll compare the structure, support, and agent experience at both Fathom and Sotheby’s, while exploring the growing appeal of newer brokerage models that don’t force you to choose between income and sophistication.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-structures-a-tale-of-two-philosophies\">Commission Structures: A Tale of Two Philosophies</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-potential-beyond-commissions\">Income Potential Beyond Commissions</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support-systems-compared\">Training and Support Systems Compared</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-marketing-resources\">Technology and Marketing Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction-and-cultural-fit\">Agent Satisfaction and Cultural Fit</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#the-verdict-who-each-model-serves-best\">The Verdict: Who Each Model Serves Best</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-structures-a-tale-of-two-philosophies\">Commission Structures: A Tale of Two Philosophies</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a straightforward proposition. Agents choose between a Share Plan with an 88/12 split that caps at $12,000 before switching to 100%, or a Max Plan offering 100% from day one with a lower $9,000 cap. There are no franchise or royalty fees. Annual costs hover around $700, and per-transaction fees are either $165 under the Share Plan or $465 under the Max Plan, with additional charges only on higher-priced sales. For high-volume agents, the savings are hard to ignore. An agent producing $10 million in volume could save over $300,000 per year compared to traditional split-based models—enough to fund a premium ad budget, a full-time assistant, or a vacation home.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s takes the opposite approach, charging agents commission splits ranging from 70/30 to 90/10 along with a 6% franchise fee and additional costs that often lack transparency. Just their E&#038;O insurance alone starts at $2,200 annually. While these expenses may be justified for agents consistently closing $5 million luxury properties, they often hit mid-tier agents the hardest. For example, an agent selling a $1.5 million listing at Sotheby’s with an 80/20 split might walk away with just $33,600 after fees. That same deal at Fathom could yield around $44,550—nearly $11,000 more per sale, lost simply to brand overhead.</p>\n<p>Agents who once felt trapped between these extremes are now looking toward hybrid brokerages that offer generous commission caps alongside luxury-grade branding resources and collaborative communities. These models aim to provide the polish of Sotheby’s with the profitability of Fathom—without the financial drain.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-potential-beyond-commissions\">Income Potential Beyond Commissions</h3>\n<p>Both Fathom and Sotheby’s reveal their limitations when it comes to long-term wealth building. At Fathom, your income stops the moment your closings do. There’s no revenue share, no stock equity, and no retirement plan. While it’s perfect for agents who want to earn and keep as much as possible right now, it leaves no room for passive income or business continuity.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s doesn’t do much better. Despite its global presence and massive referral network, the company doesn’t offer formal team-building incentives, equity options, or passive income systems. You’re leveraging the brand, but once again, the only way to earn is to close more sales. This absence of alternative income streams is a missed opportunity—especially for agents with deep client networks and long-term relationships that could be monetized beyond single transactions.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, forward-thinking brokerages are rolling out models that give agents access to multiple revenue paths. Some offer revenue share for team growth, stock rewards for production milestones, and even profit-sharing or retirement matching programs. These options allow agents to build businesses that scale beyond their own transaction count—something neither Fathom nor Sotheby’s has meaningfully addressed.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support-systems-compared\">Training and Support Systems Compared</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty’s approach to training is minimal at best. New agents receive no formal onboarding, and even experienced professionals entering the luxury market will find no structured guidance on how to navigate high-net-worth clientele or complex listings. It’s a model built on self-sufficiency, which works for seasoned agents—but leaves newer agents or those transitioning to luxury with a steep learning curve.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s does offer more robust training, but the experience depends entirely on the office you’re affiliated with. Some agents benefit from excellent coaching and mentorship, while others find themselves left with generic presentations and dated onboarding sessions. One consistent complaint across both brokerages is the lack of responsive, real-time support. For agents handling multi-million-dollar negotiations on tight timelines, the absence of 24/7 backup can be a dealbreaker.</p>\n<p>Brokerages that are redefining support today typically combine on-demand training libraries with live daily coaching and full-time transaction assistance. These resources are essential in luxury real estate, where the stakes are high, clients are demanding, and every detail matters.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-marketing-resources\">Technology and Marketing Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom provides basic back-end tools like transaction management systems and limited marketing templates. But agents are largely expected to source and pay for their own CRM, lead generation platforms, and automation tools. That may work for tech-savvy agents who want to choose their own stack, but in luxury real estate, a bare-bones setup can put you at a disadvantage. High-end clients expect polished virtual tours, AI-driven property alerts, and seamless digital experiences—and at Fathom, those services aren’t built into the model.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s makes a bigger investment in marketing, especially when it comes to presentation. Glossy brochures, branded listing packages, and global syndication are all part of the draw. But many agents report that these tools are more about brand consistency than business efficiency. The backend systems often feel outdated and disconnected, lacking the automation and customization capabilities today’s agents expect.</p>\n<p>The most effective brokerages now combine branding excellence with real business-building tools. They provide integrated CRMs designed for luxury clients, AI tools for nurturing high-net-worth leads, and automated marketing suites that deliver premium campaigns with minimal agent effort. These platforms save time, increase visibility, and elevate the experience for both agents and clients.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction-and-cultural-fit\">Agent Satisfaction and Cultural Fit</h3>\n<p>Glassdoor reviews provide an honest peek behind the curtain. Fathom Realty receives high marks for financial freedom, consistently scoring around 4.6 out of 5. Agents love the control and low fees, but many note that the experience can feel isolating. One agent summed it up by saying, “You’ll keep more money, but you’ll hit a ceiling unless you’re extremely self-motivated.”</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s earns a solid 4.0 out of 5, with many agents citing the prestige and networking opportunities as key benefits. But a deeper look reveals growing frustration with outdated systems and fee structures that don’t match today’s expectations. As one veteran agent put it, “It’s a great brand, but the cost only makes sense if you’re closing high-end listings every month.”</p>\n<p>Agents today are searching for a mix of transparency, affordability, brand strength, and collaborative energy. They want a culture that prioritizes both financial gain and professional development, not just one or the other.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-verdict-who-each-model-serves-best\">The Verdict: Who Each Model Serves Best</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a great fit for agents who already have their systems in place and want to keep as much of their income as possible. It’s ideal for high-volume producers working in mid-tier markets or experienced professionals who don’t need mentorship or marketing help. If you’re confident running your business solo, it’s a profitable model—but it comes with limitations.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s makes sense for agents in luxury-heavy markets who can truly leverage the brand. If you’re consistently listing $3 million and up properties and want to align with a heritage name that opens doors, the cost may be justified. But for agents selling homes in the $1–2 million range, the math can be tough to swallow, especially with no additional income options or true business scalability.</p>\n<p>Still, both models leave something on the table.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.<strong></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n<li>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>When real estate agents compare Fathom Realty and Compass, the contrast is immediately clear. The two brokerages serve different types of agents, with completely different takes on commission splits, technology, and support. For agents trying to decide where to align their career, the choice often comes down to what matters more—keeping more of your income or accessing sleek tools and polished branding.</p>\n<p>This comparison will unpack the core differences between Fathom and Compass, covering everything from fees and income potential to training, tech, and agent satisfaction. And if neither quite fits, we’ll also show you why more agents are choosing a hybrid path that blends profitability, innovation, and growth.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Compass</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a standout commission model that allows agents to keep 100% of their commissions. There are no franchise or royalty fees, and the structure is intentionally simple. Agents pay around $700 a year in basic fees and between $165 and $465 per transaction depending on the plan they choose. There’s no production cap, and agents aren’t penalized with hidden charges as their business grows. While there’s no top agent bonus, the cost transparency and income retention make Fathom a strong option for agents who want control over their finances.</p>\n<p>Compass takes a much different approach. Agents typically operate on commission splits ranging from 60/40 to 92.5/7.5, depending on experience, volume, and location. There’s also a 6% franchise fee and no production cap, which means even high-producing agents must continue splitting commissions. Monthly desk fees start at $145 and vary widely by market, and some agents report additional transaction fees that can go as high as 4% of the deal. For agents in luxury or urban markets, the branding and support may be worth it—but for many, the costs can feel excessive, especially without an income cap in place.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>When it comes to building wealth beyond commission, neither brokerage goes the extra mile. Fathom Realty offers no revenue share model, stock equity, retirement program, or willable income path. What you earn is entirely based on what you sell, which works for agents focused on quick income but doesn’t offer much for those thinking long-term.</p>\n<p>Compass mirrors this limitation. Despite its reputation for innovation, Compass has not introduced a revenue share model, team-building incentives, or profit-sharing for agents. Income is tied solely to closings, with no additional paths for passive earnings or ownership stake in the company. This can be a dealbreaker for agents seeking financial leverage beyond their next transaction.</p>\n<p>As the industry evolves, more agents are looking beyond these traditional models and seeking brokerages that reward leadership, production milestones, and long-term loyalty with additional income streams.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers very little in the way of structured training. There are no formal education programs and no 24/7 agent support. While this minimalist approach may suit experienced agents who don’t need handholding, newer agents or those switching markets often find themselves struggling to fill in the gaps on their own.</p>\n<p>Compass does offer more on this front through its Compass Academy. Training programs are available and often tailored to agent skill-building and technology adoption. However, real-time support is still lacking. There is no 24/7 live help for agents managing time-sensitive negotiations or complex deals. This can leave agents feeling unsupported during critical transactions, even when they’re paying top dollar to be affiliated with the brand.</p>\n<p>In today’s market, agents thrive in environments that combine self-paced learning with real-time mentorship and hands-on support. Without those elements, both Fathom and Compass fall short of what’s now considered best-in-class brokerage training.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty provides the basics: a working CRM, a transaction management platform, and simple marketing templates. But beyond that, agents are expected to supply and pay for their own tools, lead systems, and automation. This lean model is ideal for agents who already have a tech stack in place, but can be a hindrance for anyone looking for built-in efficiency or scale.</p>\n<p>Compass has built much of its reputation around proprietary tech. Its platform offers sleek design, digital marketing assets, client collaboration tools, and a centralized hub for transaction management. These tools appeal strongly to agents in luxury or high-volume markets where branding and workflow speed matter. However, all of it comes at a cost. Between high commission splits, monthly fees, and add-ons, agents often question whether the technology truly pays for itself.</p>\n<p>Modern agents increasingly expect their brokerage to provide enterprise-level tools without charging enterprise-level fees. Brokerages that bundle these systems at no extra cost are gaining ground quickly.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty holds a 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor based on hundreds of reviews. Agents consistently praise the simplicity of the financial model and the freedom to run their business without corporate interference. The most common downside is the lack of mentorship and community, with some agents noting that it can feel isolating if you’re not extremely self-motivated.</p>\n<p>Compass, on the other hand, has a 3.7-star rating across a much larger pool of reviews. Many agents love the branding, the tech, and the modern feel of the company. But there’s a recurring theme in the negative feedback: the commission splits and fees are hard to justify, especially for agents who aren’t consistently working the luxury segment. Some also mention that the company’s culture feels more like a corporate tech startup than a collaborative real estate team.</p>\n<p>What agents value most right now is a brokerage that feels like a business partner, not just a paycheck processor. Transparency, scalability, and meaningful support make the difference—and too often, both Fathom and Compass fall short of delivering all three.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-compass\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Compass</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty makes the most sense for experienced agents who want to keep as much of their income as possible. If you don’t need training, support, or technology baked into your brokerage and you prefer a simple fee structure, it’s a strong, low-cost option. The lack of growth incentives or additional income paths might be a concern, but for self-directed agents, the model works.</p>\n<p>Compass is a compelling choice for agents in luxury or tech-forward markets who want to leverage sleek tools and polished branding. The proprietary platform and modern marketing materials can help you stand out—if you’re willing to accept higher fees, lower splits, and no real financial leverage beyond your next deal.</p>\n<p>For agents seeking both profitability and professional development, it’s worth asking whether either brokerage offers the full picture. Increasingly, agents are saying no—and turning to more modern models that blend the best of both.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

LPT Realty also has a production cap of $15K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions. The brokerage provides agents with stock-based bonuses, which can increase earnings further. Monthly fees at LPT vary, starting from $0 plus transaction fees of $195 before the cap is reached.</p>\n<p>Corcoran, on the other hand, offers commission splits between 50/50 and 70/30, which are less favorable than LPT Realty’s top-tier splits. Corcoran charges a 6% franchise fee, and unlike LPT Realty, there is no production cap, meaning agents will continue to share their commissions with the brokerage no matter how much they earn. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the franchise fees, offering predictability, but the lower commission splits and ongoing fees may limit earnings potential for agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out by offering a revenue share model, allowing agents to earn additional income by recruiting new agents to the brokerage. Additionally, LPT Realty provides a retirement income path and willable income, giving agents more ways to secure long-term financial stability.</p>\n<p>Corcoran does not offer a revenue share program, retirement income path, or willable income. Agents at Corcoran rely solely on commissions for their earnings, which may limit long-term income potential compared to LPT Realty’s multiple income streams.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers minimal training and no 24/7 support, which may be a limitation for agents who require consistent guidance. While the brokerage focuses on providing agents with freedom and flexibility, it may not be ideal for those who value robust training programs.</p>\n<p>Corcoran offers training that varies by office, so the quality of training depends largely on the location. While there is no 24/7 support, Corcoran’s agents benefit from being part of a luxury brand with a strong reputation in high-end markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides modern technology and marketing tools, offering agents access to systems that help streamline transactions and boost productivity.

    "content": "<p>If you’re choosing between Fathom Realty and Keller Williams, the decision often hinges on what you value more: keeping every commission dollar or gaining access to passive income and world-class training. These two brokerages take very different approaches to supporting agents, and understanding those differences can help you make the right move for your career and financial goals.</p>\n<p>In this comparison, we’ll break down the real numbers and benefits behind Fathom and KW—from fees and income potential to support and satisfaction—so you can clearly see which model aligns best with how you want to build your business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Keller Williams</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is known for its clean, no-split commission model. Agents keep 100% of their commissions without paying any franchise or royalty fees. Costs are minimal, with transaction fees ranging from $165 to $465 depending on your plan and an annual fee of $700. There’s no production cap, which simplifies the process for high-volume agents, and there are no performance-based bonuses either—just predictable, transparent income with no surprises.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams takes a more traditional approach. Most agents start on a 70/30 split, although high producers may reach 100% after hitting a production cap, which typically ranges from $21,000 to $30,000 depending on the office. A 6% franchise fee applies until the cap is reached, and monthly desk fees vary by location. On top of that, E&#038;O insurance can cost between $122 and $350 per month, depending on the region. These ongoing fees can take a significant bite out of commissions, especially for newer agents still working to gain traction.</p>\n<p>While Fathom focuses on simplicity and agent take-home pay, Keller Williams offers more resources—but at a higher cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty keeps it simple—what you earn is what you sell. There’s no revenue share, no retirement income program, and no willable income. For agents who are focused solely on commission income and aren’t concerned with building long-term residual streams, this model may be sufficient. But for those looking to scale their business or build wealth beyond closings, the lack of secondary income paths can be limiting.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams offers agents a revenue share program that pays agents for attracting others to the company. While this program requires time and relationship-building to yield results, it can be a powerful source of passive income over time. In addition, KW offers a retirement income path that provides more financial stability as agents move into later stages of their career. For agents who value multiple income streams and are open to mentorship and leadership, Keller Williams provides more long-term financial upside than Fathom.</p>\n<p>That said, KW’s income opportunities come with a cost. Participation in the revenue share program doesn&#8217;t reduce your office expenses or splits, so the benefits depend on how much you recruit and how well your team performs.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers no formal training programs or live coaching. There’s no onboarding process for new agents and no 24/7 support. While experienced agents who already have systems in place might not miss the structure, newer agents or those switching markets often find the lack of training to be a challenge. This hands-off approach works for self-starters but can leave others feeling stranded.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams, in contrast, has built its reputation around agent training. Many agents consider KW’s education programs to be among the best in the industry. Through in-office mentorship, structured training events, and the Keller Williams University platform, agents have access to development at every level of their career. However, many of these courses come with a price tag, ranging from $299 to as high as $2,500 depending on the program. KW doesn’t offer 24/7 support either, but the structured environment and access to local leaders often help bridge that gap.</p>\n<p>For agents who learn best through direct instruction, consistent coaching, and a team environment, Keller Williams has the upper hand. But for those who want low fees and already know what they’re doing, Fathom keeps things lean and cost-effective.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty’s tech stack includes basic tools for transaction management and some marketing functionality. It’s designed to help agents complete the essentials, but it lacks advanced features like predictive analytics, AI lead follow-up, or customizable CRMs. Agents looking for more robust systems will need to invest in their own tools or work with third-party services.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams has invested heavily in its proprietary technology platform. Agents have access to command centers for lead tracking, client management, and marketing automation, as well as an integrated CRM. These tools are designed to streamline an agent’s workflow and create a scalable business, especially in busy markets. The level of tech at KW can be a significant advantage for agents juggling high volumes or running teams. However, some agents find the tools overwhelming or underutilized, and as with everything at KW, the cost must be weighed against the benefit.</p>\n<p>Agents who value built-in tech will find more at Keller Williams, but those who prefer to control their own systems—or save money—may feel more at home with Fathom.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty maintains a strong Glassdoor rating of 4.6 out of 5. Agents often cite the commission structure and low fees as the biggest advantages, especially for independent-minded professionals. However, the most common critique is the lack of mentorship and growth support, which can become a sticking point for agents looking to scale or refine their skills.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams has a 4.3 rating, with thousands of reviews highlighting the quality of training and culture of collaboration. Many agents appreciate the opportunities to grow, learn, and earn through revenue share. At the same time, some reviews mention frustration with high fees and inconsistent experiences depending on office leadership. Franchise offices vary widely, so an agent’s satisfaction often depends on the specific KW office they join.</p>\n<p>The most satisfied agents today are those who feel both empowered and supported. For some, that means lower fees and autonomy. For others, it means paying more but gaining access to live mentorship, business tools, and income diversification.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-keller-williams\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Keller Williams</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is a smart choice for agents who want maximum take-home pay and a no-frills model. If you’re confident in your skills, have your own tools in place, and don’t need mentorship or extra training, Fathom offers financial freedom with minimal overhead. But if you’re looking to build a long-term business, the lack of revenue share, training, or support may start to feel restrictive.</p>\n<p>Keller Williams, meanwhile, offers a broader ecosystem of income opportunities, education, and proprietary tools. It’s an excellent fit for agents who value training, want to participate in revenue share, and are focused on building wealth over time. The trade-off is higher fees and a more corporate structure—but for many agents, that structure provides exactly the support they need to grow.</p>\n<p>Of course, if neither of these models feels like the right fit, there’s a third path that combines the best of both.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/0d96c9e9a802d78a-Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp/public\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

There is no franchise or royalty fee, which helps agents retain a larger portion of their earnings. LPT Realty has a production cap of $15K, and once agents hit the cap, they keep 100% of their commissions. Monthly fees range from $0 to $149 per month, depending on the agent&#8217;s chosen plan. Transaction fees are $195 before the cap is reached, providing predictability in costs.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers commission splits between 60/40 and 80/20. While this is competitive, it may not be as appealing to agents seeking higher earnings. The franchise fee is set at 6%, and there is no production cap, meaning agents will continue paying franchise fees regardless of their production level. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the royalty structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers additional income opportunities beyond commissions, including a revenue share program. This allows agents to build a team and earn passive income, enhancing their long-term financial stability. LPT Realty also provides retirement income and willable income paths, giving agents more control over their future.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens does not offer revenue share, retirement income, or willable income paths. Agents working at Better Homes &#038; Gardens are limited to commission-based income, which may not provide the same level of long-term financial security as LPT Realty’s additional income streams.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides no formal training but offers 24/7 agent support, which is beneficial for agents who value immediate assistance. This support is particularly helpful for agents who need help with transactions or business development outside regular business hours.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens offers training that varies by office, so the level of education and support may depend on location. However, it does not provide 24/7 support, which could be a limitation for agents needing real-time help.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty provides agents with modern technology tools, including CRM systems and marketing platforms, to help streamline their work and boost productivity. The brokerage focuses on using tech to support agents in growing their business and staying competitive in the market.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens also offers technological resources, particularly marketing tools, but the level of available technology support varies by office. Agents working in locations with fewer resources may find that they lack access to the most up-to-date technology, which could impact their ability to compete effectively in their markets.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 37 reviews. Agents appreciate the transparent fee structure and the additional income opportunities provided by the brokerage.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars from 256 reviews. While agents highlight the strong brand reputation and marketing support, they often express concerns over the higher franchise fees and the absence of revenue-sharing or retirement benefits.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-better-homes-gardens\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Better Homes &#038; Gardens</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out for its favorable commission splits, lower fees, and multiple income streams, making it an excellent choice for agents looking to maximize their earnings and build long-term wealth. The 24/7 agent support and modern technology offerings also provide a more flexible and agent-friendly experience.</p>\n<p>Better Homes &#038; Gardens is a well-known and reputable brand, which can be beneficial for agents looking to leverage brand recognition in their marketing.

Handing out a custom business card at an open house or networking event can make you stand out long after your initial meeting. Unlike generic business cards, a well-designed, personalized card reflects your commitment to quality and sets the tone for future interactions.</p>\n<p>Studies show that 72% of people form judgments on a company or individual based on the quality of their business cards. In an industry as people-centric as real estate, custom cards can be a game-changer.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exclusive-canva-templates-for-your-real-estate-business\">Exclusive Canva Templates for Your Real Estate Business Cards</h2>\n<p>To help real estate professionals like yourself elevate their branding, we are sharing a collection of custom Canva business card templates.

Our templates include optional spaces for QR codes, linking directly to your website or social media platforms. This integration ensures that potential clients can learn more about you with a single scan, bridging the gap between offline interactions and your online portfolio.</p>\n<p>Adding digital elements like QR codes helps reinforce your tech-savvy image while providing quick access to listings or client testimonials, giving your card extended utility in the digital age.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-branding-tools-for-real-estate-agents\">More Branding Tools for Real Estate Agents</h2>\n<p>Your business card is only one part of your overall branding strategy. To create a consistent brand experience, it’s essential to use similar design elements across other materials such as flyers, brochures, and listing sheets. By doing so, you present a cohesive and professional image that clients will recognize and trust.</p>\n<p>At eXp Realty and within the Smart Agent Alliance (that&#8217;s us!), agents have access to customizable templates for various marketing needs?. This makes it easier to maintain uniform branding across all print and digital assets.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dont-forget-to-show-your-card-design-to-your-broker\">Don&#8217;t Forget to Show Your Card Design to Your Broker</h2>\n<p>Before you print your new business cards, make sure to show your design to your broker. This crucial step ensures that your card meets state rules and regulations for real estate advertising. Brokers can verify that the required information, such as license numbers or brokerage details, is correctly displayed and compliant with local laws. Taking this step helps you avoid potential issues and guarantees that your branding aligns with both legal standards and professional guidelines.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"285\" src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/RZBQ4dWu2c_YEpklnDDxFg/d5bcc1e9fa801ca1-Business-Card-Template-Bloog-Images-3.webp/public\" alt=\"Business Card Template Blog Images 3\" class=\"wp-image-249458\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Business-Card-Template-Bloog-Images-3.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Business-Card-Template-Bloog-Images-3-300x86.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Business-Card-Template-Bloog-Images-3-768x219.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-access-and-use-the-templates\">Download and Use the Templates</h2>\n<p>Getting started with these custom business card templates is simple:</p>\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fill Out The Form Bellow</strong>: Submission of the form will automatically send you to the templates.</li>\n<li><strong>Sign In to <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canva</a></strong>: If you don’t already have an account, you can sign up for free.</li>\n<li><strong>Make a Copy</strong>: Once you’ve accessed the template, make a copy to customize it without affecting the original design.</li>\n<li><strong>Customize Your Template</strong>: Use Canva’s intuitive tools to change colors, fonts, and add your personal or brand-specific details.</li>\n<li><strong>Download and Print</strong>: Once your card is ready, download it in your preferred format (PDF or PNG) and print it at home or through a professional printing service.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><iframe\n  src=\"https://link.proedgemarketingcrm.com/widget/form/RGu9I8sb5FXiL81X0vxI\"\n  style=\"width:100%;height:100%;border:none;border-radius:3px\"\n  id=\"inline-RGu9I8sb5FXiL81X0vxI\" \n  data-layout=\"{'id':'INLINE'}\"\n  data-trigger-type=\"alwaysShow\"\n  data-trigger-value=\"\"\n  data-activation-type=\"alwaysActivated\"\n  data-activation-value=\"\"\n  data-deactivation-type=\"neverDeactivate\"\n  data-deactivation-value=\"\"\n  data-form-name=\"Business Card Templates\"\n  data-height=\"749\"\n  data-layout-iframe-id=\"inline-RGu9I8sb5FXiL81X0vxI\"\n  data-form-id=\"RGu9I8sb5FXiL81X0vxI\"\n  title=\"Business Card Templates\"\n      ><br />\n</iframe><br />\n<script src=\"https://link.proedgemarketingcrm.com/js/form_embed.js\"></script></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">That&#8217;s A Wrap!</h2>\n<p>Investing in a personalized business card is an investment in your brand and your future success.

    "content": "<p>In this comparison of LPT vs Douglas Elliman, we will break down the key differences in commission structures, income opportunities, and resources that agents need to consider before deciding which brokerage is the best fit for their career.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Douglas Elliman</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join Our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a competitive commission split that ranges from 80/20 to 100/0, allowing agents flexibility in how much of their earnings they keep. There is no franchise or royalty fee, which makes LPT more favorable for agents looking to maximize their income. The production cap is $15K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions. LPT Realty also offers flexible monthly fee structures, ranging from $500/year plus transaction fees, or agents can opt for $89 or $149 per month, depending on their plan. Transaction fees are $195 before reaching the cap.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, on the other hand, has commission splits ranging from 50/50 to 70/30, which is significantly lower than LPT Realty’s highest splits. Additionally, Douglas Elliman charges a 6% franchise/royalty fee, which reduces agents’ overall income. The brokerage does not offer a production cap, meaning agents continue to split their commissions with the brokerage regardless of their earnings. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty fee structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers additional income opportunities through its revenue share model, allowing agents to earn passive income by recruiting new agents. LPT Realty also provides retirement income and willable income paths, making it a more attractive option for agents who want to plan for their long-term financial future.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman does not offer a revenue share program, retirement income, or willable income path. Agents at Douglas Elliman are limited to commission-based income, which may not be ideal for those looking to build additional wealth through other streams.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not offer a formal training program, but agents benefit from 24/7 support, giving them access to assistance whenever they need it, a crucial factor for agents who operate in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman provides training that varies by office, which may lead to inconsistencies in the quality and availability of training. Like LPT Realty, Douglas Elliman does not offer 24/7 agent support, meaning agents may need to rely on office resources during regular business hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty focuses on providing agents with streamlined, technology-driven tools to enhance productivity. Agents can access essential resources such as CRM systems and marketing tools to help them manage leads and optimize workflows efficiently.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, being a more traditional brokerage, offers strong branding and marketing support, especially when targeting luxury clients. However, it may not offer the same cloud-based efficiency as LPT Realty for agents looking to streamline their business in a modern way.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty holds a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars based on 37 reviews, with agents frequently praising the flexibility in commission splits and the income opportunities through the revenue share model.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, with a rating of 3.9 stars from 638 reviews, has agents who often appreciate the brand prestige but express concerns over the lower commission splits and lack of long-term financial planning options.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Douglas Elliman</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a more agent-friendly fee structure, higher commission splits, and additional income streams through its revenue share model. Its flexibility in fees and long-term financial benefits make it an attractive option for agents focused on maximizing their earnings and planning for the future.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, while prestigious and established, may be a better fit for agents working in luxury markets who value brand recognition over income opportunities. However, the lower commission splits and lack of a cap on commissions could limit earning potential.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included within the royalty structure, providing a more predictable cost, but with the absence of a cap, agents at The Agency may see reduced earnings in the long term.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a revenue share program, allowing agents to earn additional passive income by recruiting other agents to join the brokerage. This model can provide substantial additional income over time, making it an appealing choice for agents interested in team building. LPT also provides retirement and willable income paths, allowing agents to plan for their long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>The Agency does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income paths, or willable income options. Agents at The Agency are limited to their commission-based income, which may restrict long-term wealth-building potential.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty does not have structured training or 24/7 agent support, which may be a downside for newer agents or those who prefer more hands-on guidance.</p>\n<p>The Agency, like LPT, offers training that varies by office. However, there is no 24/7 agent support, meaning agents may need to rely on local office resources or colleagues for assistance outside of business hours. This lack of centralized, consistent support can be a limitation for agents seeking continuous professional development.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a cloud-based platform that provides agents with CRM systems, transaction management tools, and marketing resources to help streamline their business operations.</p>\n<p>The Agency is well-known for its high-end marketing capabilities and strong brand presence, particularly in luxury real estate. However, The Agency’s focus is more on branding and luxury marketing than on providing a modern, cloud-based tech platform like LPT Realty’s.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty has a 4.3-star rating on Glassdoor from 37 reviews, with agents highlighting the income opportunities and flexibility as key benefits.</p>\n<p>The Agency has a 4.1-star rating from 72 reviews. Agents often praise the brand’s reputation and the opportunities to work with luxury clientele, but the higher fees and lack of passive income options are noted as potential drawbacks.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-vs-the-agency\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs The Agency</h4>\n<p>LPT Realty offers a more flexible and financially rewarding model for agents looking for lower fees, a production cap, and passive income opportunities through revenue sharing. It’s an excellent choice for agents focused on building long-term wealth and minimizing costs.</p>\n<p>The Agency, on the other hand, is a strong choice for agents targeting the luxury market who value a prestigious brand and high-end marketing tools. However, the higher fees and lack of a production cap may not be ideal for all agents, particularly those looking for more income flexibility and support.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.

There’s no franchise or royalty fee at LPT Realty, allowing agents to retain a greater portion of their earnings. The production cap is set at $15K, and after reaching this cap, agents keep 100% of their commissions. Monthly fees at LPT Realty are low, starting at $0, plus either an $89 or $149 monthly option depending on the plan an agent selects. Transaction fees before the cap are $195, which keeps costs predictable and manageable.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway, by contrast, offers commission splits between 60/40 and 90/10. However, it charges a 6% franchise fee, which impacts the overall earnings for agents. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway doesn’t offer a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split their commissions with the brokerage indefinitely. Monthly fees at Berkshire Hathaway vary by office, and transaction fees range from $295 to $625, adding up over time, especially for high-producing agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty stands out with its revenue share model, which allows agents to earn additional passive income by recruiting new agents. This gives agents a great opportunity to boost their earnings while growing their teams. LPT also offers retirement and willable income paths, ensuring long-term financial benefits for agents as they build their careers.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway does not offer a revenue share program, retirement income path, or willable income options. Agents are limited to earning from commissions, which may be a disadvantage for those seeking to grow wealth through multiple streams of income.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty does not provide formal training programs, but agents have access to 24/7 agent support, ensuring they have the help they need whenever they need it. This makes LPT Realty a good choice for self-motivated agents who are comfortable learning on their own but still want access to support.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway’s training programs vary by office, meaning the quality and availability of training are not uniform across all locations. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway does not offer 24/7 support, so agents may have to rely on local resources for assistance outside of regular business hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers agents access to modern technology and tools, including CRM systems and marketing platforms, to help them manage their businesses efficiently. LPT’s technology-driven approach gives agents the flexibility they need to succeed in today’s fast-paced real estate market.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway is a more traditional brokerage, but it does provide agents with marketing tools and resources, especially when it comes to leveraging its well-known brand. However, its technology offerings may not be as cutting-edge as LPT’s cloud-based platforms.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty has a Glassdoor rating of 4.3 stars based on 37 reviews, with agents appreciating the low costs, flexibility, and additional income streams offered through the revenue share program.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway has a slightly higher Glassdoor rating of 4.2 stars from 981 reviews. Agents often praise the strong brand reputation and client base, but some express concerns over the ongoing fees and lack of income opportunities beyond commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-lpt-realty-vs-berkshire-hathaway\">Final Thoughts on LPT vs Berkshire Hathaway</h3>\n<p>LPT Realty offers agents more flexibility, lower costs, and the ability to earn passive income through a revenue share model, making it an attractive option for agents focused on building long-term financial stability. The 24/7 agent support and modern technology platforms further enhance its appeal.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway is a well-established brand with strong recognition, which may appeal to agents looking for the backing of a traditional, trusted name in real estate. However, the lack of a production cap, additional income streams, and higher fees might not suit agents who prioritize earning potential and cost efficiency.</p>\n<p>For more in-depth comparisons, check out our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages.
