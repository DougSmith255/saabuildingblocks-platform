    "content": "<p>This comparison between Real vs The Agency will help agents understand the differences in commission splits, income potential, and agent resources. Each brokerage offers distinct advantages, depending on what agents prioritize in their careers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\">\n<p><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-the-agency\">Final Thoughts on Real vs The Agency</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers highly competitive commission splits ranging from 85/15 to 100/0, with no franchise or royalty fees, allowing agents to retain more of their earnings. Real Broker also has a production cap of $12K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions. There’s also a top agent bonus of $24K, which adds to the financial incentive. Monthly fees are $750/year, and transaction fees are $0 until the cap is reached, making it a straightforward cost model for agents.</p>\n<p>The Agency offers commission splits between 70/30 and 90/10, similar to many traditional brokerages. However, they charge a 6% franchise/royalty fee, which impacts an agent’s overall earnings. Unlike Real Broker, The Agency does not have a production cap, meaning agents will always be splitting their commission with the brokerage, no matter how much they produce. Monthly fees at The Agency vary by office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty fee structure.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides agents with additional income opportunities through its revenue share program. Agents can earn passive income by recruiting others to join the brokerage, creating a secondary income stream. Real Broker also offers retirement income paths and willable income with time qualification, which are great options for agents looking to build long-term wealth.</p>\n<p>The Agency does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income, or willable income options. Agents working with The Agency are limited to commission-based earnings, which may not be as financially rewarding in the long term.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h4>\n<p>Real Broker offers more than 30 live training sessions each week, giving agents the resources they need to continuously grow. Additionally, Real Broker provides 24/7 agent support, ensuring that agents always have assistance when they need it, which is a major advantage for agents working outside of typical business hours.</p>\n<p>The Agency also provides training, but the availability and quality depend on the office location, making it less consistent. There is no 24/7 support at The Agency, which could be a disadvantage for agents needing immediate assistance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker’s modern, cloud-based platform offers a variety of tools, including CRM systems, marketing platforms, and transaction management systems. This technology helps agents streamline their work and operate efficiently.</p>\n<p>The Agency is known for its luxury branding and marketing resources, which are tailored toward high-end clientele. However, it lacks the advanced cloud-based systems that Real Broker provides. For agents focused on luxury markets, The Agency&#8217;s branding is an asset, but it may not match the modern tools offered by Real Broker.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker has a Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews, with agents praising the clear fee structure, support, and opportunities for revenue sharing.</p>\n<p>The Agency holds a Glassdoor rating of 4.1 stars from 72 reviews. While agents appreciate the brand’s luxury appeal, there are some concerns about the commission structure and lack of additional income opportunities.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-the-agency\">Final Thoughts on Real vs The Agency</h3>\n<p>Real Broker is the better choice for agents who prioritize maximizing earnings, leveraging passive income opportunities, and having access to modern technology. Its competitive commission structure, lower fees, and revenue share model make it an attractive option for agents who want to build a scalable, long-term career.</p>\n<p>The Agency is a good fit for agents who focus on luxury real estate and prefer working with a prestigious brand. However, the lack of a production cap, higher fees, and no additional income streams may limit its appeal for agents looking to grow financially.</p>\n<p>For more information, explore our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to get a clearer understanding of which brokerage is right for you.

    "content": "<p>Choosing between Fathom Realty and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices comes down to a core question: do you want brand prestige or maximum income retention? These brokerages operate from two entirely different philosophies. Fathom focuses on agent autonomy and a predictable fee structure, while Berkshire Hathaway leans on legacy branding and luxury market credibility—but with heavier costs. If you’re evaluating which model better supports your long-term growth and income goals, this breakdown lays out everything you need to know.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-berkshire-hathaway\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Berkshire Hathaway</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty makes commission splits simple. Agents keep 100% of their commission on every transaction, with no franchise fees or royalty deductions. There’s no production cap, so your income isn’t penalized no matter how much you sell. The only recurring costs are an annual $700 fee and flat-rate transaction fees that fall between $165 and $465 depending on your plan. It’s a low-overhead structure designed to give agents more control over their income with fewer surprises.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway uses a traditional commission split model, typically ranging from 60/40 to 90/10. However, every transaction includes a 6% franchise fee—even after the agent hits their cap, which is not common among modern brokerages. There’s no production cap here either, meaning agents continue paying split percentages and franchise fees indefinitely. Monthly fees and transaction charges vary by office, but it’s not uncommon to see costs that range from $295 to $625 per transaction, in addition to variable office dues.</p>\n<p>The difference is clear: Fathom prioritizes take-home income, while Berkshire Hathaway builds its cost structure around maintaining its luxury brand footprint.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty sticks to one lane when it comes to income: commission. There is no revenue share model, no stock incentives, and no retirement or willable income structure. Agents earn only what they sell, making it a straightforward but narrow model for those looking to scale beyond personal production.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway is equally limited in this regard. Despite its size and reputation, the brokerage offers no passive income opportunities. There’s no formal program to reward agents for building teams, attracting other agents, or contributing to company growth. Your earnings begin and end with closed transactions.</p>\n<p>For agents who are focused solely on commission, both models offer viable options. But for those who want to build long-term, scalable wealth, neither provides a structure to support that growth.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty takes a minimalist approach to training. There is no formal onboarding program, no company-wide education platform, and no access to 24/7 support. While this approach may appeal to experienced agents who don’t need external guidance, it can be a significant drawback for new agents or those who are navigating unfamiliar markets.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway does offer training, but the quality and availability vary by office. In some locations, agents receive strong mentorship and educational opportunities. In others, the resources are sparse or outdated. There’s no centralized, always-available support system, which makes it harder for agents to get the help they need during nights, weekends, or last-minute client emergencies.</p>\n<p>If you’re self-directed and don’t need much hand-holding, either brokerage may be sufficient. But if you&#8217;re seeking structured development and high-level coaching, neither model provides the level of ongoing support that agents now expect.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty provides cloud-based systems and core operational tools like a CRM and transaction management platform. The technology is modern, functional, and designed to help agents stay organized—but it’s not proprietary or focused on luxury presentation. Agents are encouraged to bring in or build their own tech stacks to suit their specific business model, making Fathom a flexible option for tech-savvy agents who know what tools they want.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway offers a more traditional suite of marketing and tech resources. These tools often focus on maintaining the brand’s luxury image—think branded listing materials, email templates, and marketing support that leans heavily into high-end aesthetics. While useful for agents working luxury listings, the tech is less about automation or innovation and more about reinforcing the company’s image. In many offices, the backend platforms are aging and may not integrate well with modern lead generation tools.</p>\n<p>Agents looking for tech flexibility and streamlined workflows often lean toward Fathom. Those prioritizing a brand-enhancing toolkit for high-end listings might prefer Berkshire Hathaway—though it comes with a cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty boasts a 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor, with agents often praising the fee structure, commission model, and freedom to build their business independently. Many reviews describe Fathom as the ideal environment for experienced agents who want to stop splitting their hard-earned commission. However, the lack of support, training, and passive income potential is a common point of concern among those looking to grow or scale.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway holds a 4.2-star rating based on nearly 1,000 reviews. Agents frequently express pride in representing a household brand, especially in the luxury segment. However, some reviews also highlight frustration with ongoing franchise fees, lower splits, and inconsistent office leadership. The prestige is real—but it often comes at the expense of profitability and growth flexibility.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, agent satisfaction at both brokerages comes down to what agents value most: income retention or brand prestige.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-berkshire-hathaway\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Berkshire Hathaway</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is the better fit for agents who want to maximize earnings and minimize brokerage interference. If you’re confident in your ability to operate independently and prefer a lean model that keeps more money in your pocket, Fathom offers exactly that. Its tech-forward, flat-fee model favors experienced agents who no longer need expensive branding to validate their business.</p>\n<p>Berkshire Hathaway, in contrast, is a solid choice for agents focused on luxury markets who see brand recognition as a key asset in winning high-end listings. The trade-off, however, is steep. Between high splits, never-ending franchise fees, and inconsistent support, it’s not always the best long-term financial move for agents looking to build wealth.</p>\n<p>If neither model delivers the right combination of income, support, and opportunity, you’re not alone—and there’s a better option that combines the best of both.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

In addition, Real Broker offers a top agent bonus of $24K, further increasing earning potential.

Unlike Real Broker, Berkshire Hathaway does not have a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split their commissions with the brokerage regardless of their earnings.

    "content": "<p>Choosing between Real Broker and Coldwell Banker can significantly impact an agent’s career trajectory, earnings, and overall satisfaction. This comparison explores key differences in commission structures, fees, training, and support to help agents make an informed decision.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Coldwell Banker</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers agents a competitive commission split ranging from 85/15 to 100/0, with no franchise or royalty fees, making it one of the most attractive options for agents looking to retain more of their earnings. The production cap is $12K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions, and a top agent bonus of $24K is available for high performers. The annual fee is $750, and transaction fees are $0 until the agent reaches the cap, offering a straightforward fee structure.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker provides commission splits between 55/45 and 90/10. However, agents are required to pay a franchise/royalty fee ranging from 5% to 6.5%, which reduces their overall earnings. Unlike Real Broker, Coldwell Banker does not have a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split their commissions with the brokerage no matter how much they earn. Monthly fees range from $150 to $179 depending on the office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty fees, simplifying some of the costs but making the franchise fees a major consideration for agents.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides agents with the opportunity to build wealth through a revenue share program, which allows agents to earn additional income by recruiting others to the brokerage. In addition, Real Broker offers a retirement income path and willable income, making it a great choice for agents who want to plan for long-term financial security.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker, however, does not offer a revenue share program or any retirement income path. This limits agents to commission-based income, which may not provide the same financial stability or wealth-building potential that Real Broker offers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker excels in offering continuous training and 24/7 agent support. Agents have access to over 30 live training sessions each week, allowing them to stay up-to-date with industry trends and strategies. The 24/7 support ensures that agents can always get the help they need, which is particularly important for newer agents or those working in fast-paced markets.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker offers training that varies by office, and the quality can depend on the specific location. However, the absence of 24/7 support can be a disadvantage for agents who require more flexibility or immediate assistance.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker’s technology is built with a cloud-based model, offering agents advanced tools for CRM, marketing, and transaction management. This makes Real Broker particularly appealing to agents who are comfortable using technology to streamline their workflows and grow their business.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker also provides technological tools, though they vary by office. While the brokerage has a long-established presence in the industry, its technology infrastructure may not be as modern or flexible as Real Broker’s.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker has a high Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews, with agents praising the transparent fee structure, revenue share model, and strong agent support.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker has a 4.3-star rating from 2.6K reviews, with agents appreciating the brand’s reputation and extensive network. However, there are concerns about the high fees and the lack of additional income opportunities beyond commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-coldwell-banker\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Coldwell Banker</h3>\n<p>Real Broker is a better option for agents seeking lower fees, and passive income opportunities through a revenue share program, and cutting-edge technology. The competitive commission splits and strong support infrastructure make it a great choice for agents looking to maximize their earnings and streamline their business.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker’s established brand and network are appealing, but the high fees, ongoing franchise costs, and lack of revenue share or retirement income options may not be ideal for agents seeking to grow their financial security in the long term.</p>\n<p>For more information, explore our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to get a clearer understanding of which brokerage is right for you.

Whether you’re working within the U.S. or internationally, eXp’s platform makes it incredibly easy to send referral business across all 50 states and in 27 countries, thanks to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/locations/\">eXp’s global reach and international real estate network.</a></p>\n<p>While eXp agents are free to send referrals to non-eXp agents, the chances are high that you’ll find the perfect match within eXp’s 89,000+ agents. With eXp’s online agent directory, locating top talent is a breeze.</p>\n<p>What really sets eXp apart is its seamless, tech-powered agent referral tool. The company has built an exclusive online portal designed to make providing and managing referrals super easy. Let’s break it down:</p>\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Log in to eXp’s Referral website and start a new referral.</li>\n<li>Enter your client’s info.</li>\n<li>Search <a href=\"https://exprealty.com/agents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">eXp Agent Directory</a>, reach out to an agent to see if they’re a fit for your client, and negotiate your referral commission.</li>\n<li>Complete your referral commission agreement, auto-fill the selected agent, and hit submit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Easy peasy. Once you submit the referral, eXp takes it from there. They handle gathering signatures from you, the other agent, and both brokers, and they track the deal until it closes, ensuring you get paid. Note – if you’re providing a buyer referral, you’ll want to upload your referral contract to skyslope to ensure a smooth payment process.</p>\n<p>The platform keeps things smooth and hassle-free while sending you updates at every key step so you’re never left in the dark. With this fast and efficient system, managing referrals has never been easier, and you always stay in control.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-referral-division-saves-agents-money\">eXp Referral Division Saves Agents Money</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"196\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247866\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/eXp-Realty-Referral-Division-Saves-Agents-Money.webp\" alt=\"eXp Realty Referral Division, eXp Realty Referral Division Saves Agents Money\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/eXp-Realty-Referral-Division-Saves-Agents-Money.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/eXp-Realty-Referral-Division-Saves-Agents-Money-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/eXp-Realty-Referral-Division-Saves-Agents-Money-768x151.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>While all eXp agents enjoy the fast and easy referral business, eXp Realty’s Referral Division is specifically designed for agents who want to focus solely on referrals. For those agents, eXp has created a way to drastically <strong>lower the typical costs</strong> associated with being a real estate agent.</p>\n<p>How? By making referral-only agents part of eXp Commercial. This setup means referral agents don’t need to pay hefty MLS or Realtor association fees—those can add up fast! It’s a massive cost-saver for agents who just want to pass clients along to other agents and not get involved in the actual deal.</p>\n<p>On top of that, eXp has sweetened the deal with a reduced monthly fee for referral-only agents, <strong>cutting costs by more than 40%!</strong> So not only do you avoid MLS and association fees, but you’re also getting an even lower monthly expense than what’s shown in our full breakdown of <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/fees\">eXp Realty fees</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ideal-candidates-for-referral-division\">Ideal Candidates for Referral Division</h2>\n<p>The eXp Referral Division is perfect for agents who want to keep their active real estate license without the grind of day-to-day activities. Instead of juggling listings, open houses, or closing complicated deals, you can focus on generating referral leads.</p>\n<p>Refer potential clients to other agents, sit back, and earn a fee or percentage of the commission when the deal closes—easy as that! Let’s explore which agents will benefit most from this division:</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agents-seeking-a-more-balanced-schedule\">Agents Seeking a More Balanced Schedule</h3>\n<p>For agents looking to stay involved in real estate without the pressures of full-time selling, the eXp Referral Division is a game-changer.</p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re juggling family commitments, exploring other career paths, or simply not ready for the demands of active real estate, this division offers a fantastic middle ground. You can still make money without sacrificing your lifestyle or time.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"part-time-real-estate-professionals\">Part-Time Real Estate Professionals</h3>\n<p>This setup provides the kind of flexibility that traditional real estate roles often lack, allowing you to stay in the game without the full-time commitment. Not every agent wants—or needs—to be in real estate full-time.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself doing fewer deals and questioning whether it’s worth paying for an active license, the referral division could be the answer. By eliminating fees like Realtor association dues, SUPRA fees, and others, this option saves you money while letting you stay in the industry.</p>\n<p>You get to keep your license and earn commissions by handing off leads to active agents—making real estate work for you, on your terms.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"retiring-agents\">Retiring Agents</h3>\n<p>For agents nearing retirement or those stepping back from an active role, the referral division offers the perfect solution. You can still leverage your years of experience by referring clients to other agents.</p>\n<p>This lets you remain connected to the real estate world and generate income, all without the stress of full-time work. It&#8217;s a smooth transition into retirement while maintaining your professional network and expertise.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-referral-divisions-fees\">eXp Referral Divisions Fees</h2>\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:auto 64%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p>Let’s talk numbers! The eXp Referral Division keeps things straightforward and affordable. For just <strong>$50 a month</strong>, you gain access to eXp World, Workplace, and all the tools you’ll need, including Skyslope, My eXp, eXp University, and a global network of professionals. It&#8217;s a small price for staying connected and generating referral income. Here’s the details:</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"770\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Refferal-Devision-2.0.webp\" alt=\"eXp Referral Division included benefits\" class=\"wp-image-248806 size-full\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Refferal-Devision-2.0.webp 600w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Refferal-Devision-2.0-234x300.webp 234w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exp-realty-referral-divisions-splits\">eXp Realty Referral Divisions Splits</h2>\n<p>Now, let’s break down the splits. When you refer a client to an eXp agent, you keep 75% of the referral fee, and eXp takes 25%. If you refer a client to a non-eXp agent, you pocket 70% while eXp gets 30%.</p>\n<p>So, whether you’re keeping it in the eXp family or referring outside, the division has you covered with a fair, predictable split.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"moving-from-realty-to-referral\">Moving From Realty To Referral</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-247868\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moving-From-Realty-To-Referral.webp\" alt=\"eXp Realty Referral Division, Moving From Realty To Referral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"201\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moving-From-Realty-To-Referral.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moving-From-Realty-To-Referral-300x60.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moving-From-Realty-To-Referral-768x154.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n</h2>\n<p>Ready to make the shift? Your first step is to contact your state broker team—they&#8217;ll guide you through the process and help you with timing. You&#8217;ll sign a new Independent Contractor Agreement, but don&#8217;t worry, you’ll keep the same sponsor, so no need to start over from scratch!</p>\n<p>Before you switch from Realty to the Referral Division, here’s what to expect: You’ll lose access to Realtor forms and MLS services, but you’ll get a shiny new email address (yourname@expreferral.com) and updated marketing materials reflecting your status with eXp Referral, brokered by eXp Commercial.</p>\n<p>One small caveat: referral agents won’t have access to Regus office spaces anymore. So, while you’ll be saving big on expenses, make sure you’re ready for the trade-offs!  You can find more specifics <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xin9O0zXx9Q2jKrca99-kzSQ1yhUnXZ-fxloIKM_sWc/edit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"thats-a-wrap\">Why the eXp Referral Division Just Makes Sense</h2>\n<p>Let’s be real—traditional real estate life isn’t always glamorous. Between sky-high fees, unpredictable closings, and clients who ghost harder than your high school crush, it’s no wonder so many agents eventually ask, “Is there a better way to stay in real estate without losing my mind?”</p>\n<p>The eXp Referral Division is that sweet spot between staying licensed and staying sane. Whether you&#8217;re easing into retirement, juggling a side hustle, or just done with fighting over lockbox codes, this model offers a tech-powered, low-cost way to keep earning without touching a transaction. No MLS fees. No Supra key headaches. Just referrals, clicks, and commission checks.</p>\n<p>And when you combine that with the added value of joining eXp and naming a sponsor like Smart Agent Alliance, you’re getting a rocket ship.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/smart-agent-alliance\">Smart Agent Alliance</a> runs meetings so you gain <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/revenue-share/\">passive income</a>.

    "content": "<p>In this comparison between Real vs Redfin, we’ll examine how these two brokerages differ in terms of commission structure, fees, and the opportunities they provide for real estate agents. Each brokerage operates with distinct models, appealing to different types of agents.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Redfin</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers agents commission splits from 85/15 to 100/0 with no franchise or royalty fees, allowing agents to maximize their earnings. The production cap is $12K, after which agents keep 100% of their commissions. Additionally, there is a $24K top agent bonus for those who hit the highest production levels. Real Broker’s annual fee is $750, with no transaction fees until the cap is reached, providing a transparent and cost-effective structure for agents.</p>\n<p>Redfin, however, operates on a different model. Agents working for Redfin receive salaries rather than the traditional commission-based structure. This can offer more stability for agents who prefer a fixed income, but it also limits the potential for higher earnings based on individual performance. Redfin’s commission splits range from 30/70 to 75/25, but these splits apply to specific transactions rather than providing agents with full commission flexibility. Monthly fees are not charged at Redfin, and transaction fees are covered, but the capped earning potential is a significant limitation for agents used to working in a commission-based environment.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides agents with multiple income opportunities beyond their commissions. The brokerage offers a revenue share program that allows agents to earn passive income through team building and recruitment. Additionally, Real Broker has retirement income paths and willable income opportunities with time qualification, giving agents options for long-term financial planning.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Redfin does not offer any additional income streams such as revenue share or retirement income options. Agents are strictly paid based on salary and transaction bonuses, which can limit their ability to build long-term wealth or passive income.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker stands out with its comprehensive support, offering 30+ live training sessions weekly and 24/7 agent support. This ensures that agents have access to valuable learning resources and assistance whenever they need it.</p>\n<p>Redfin provides local training programs, typically lasting four weeks, aimed at getting agents familiar with their unique business model. However, Redfin does not offer ongoing, robust training options like Real Broker, and it lacks 24/7 agent support, which can be a disadvantage for agents seeking continuous development or working outside of typical hours.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers modern, cloud-based technology tools, including advanced CRM systems, transaction management, and marketing platforms, to streamline agents&#8217; operations and maximize their productivity. This cloud-first approach gives Real Broker an edge for agents looking for flexibility and efficiency in their business.</p>\n<p>Redfin is also known for its advanced technology, particularly when it comes to generating leads and simplifying the transaction process. However, Redfin’s tools are primarily designed to support its salaried agent model, which may not be as appealing for agents who prefer working independently or with more commission-based flexibility.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker enjoys a high level of agent satisfaction, with a Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews. Agents frequently mention the transparent fee structure, income opportunities, and support systems as key advantages.</p>\n<p>Redfin has a lower Glassdoor rating of 3.6 stars from 1.9K reviews. While many agents appreciate the stability of a salaried position, complaints often center on the limited earning potential and lack of independence compared to traditional brokerages.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-redfin\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Redfin</h3>\n<p>Real Broker is a better fit for agents looking for more flexibility, higher earning potential, and the opportunity to build passive income through a revenue share program. Its cloud-based platform and extensive training resources make it a great choice for agents seeking a modern and scalable real estate career.</p>\n<p>Redfin, however, may appeal to agents who prioritize a stable salary and consistent work but may not offer the same growth potential or financial rewards as Real Broker.</p>\n<p>For more information, explore our <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\"><strong>eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to get a clearer understanding of which brokerage is right for you.

    "content": "<p>Fathom Realty and The Agency couldn’t be more different in how they approach agent compensation and support. One offers simplicity and full commission retention. The other leans into brand prestige and luxury real estate—but with a more traditional fee-heavy structure. Whether you’re focused on maximizing every commission check or breaking into the high-end market, your choice of brokerage will shape how far and how fast you grow.</p>\n<p>This side-by-side breakdown covers what matters most to agents today—from commission splits and income opportunities to tech, support, and agent satisfaction—so you can decide which brokerage actually supports your goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-the-agency\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. The Agency</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty runs on a 100% commission model. That means agents keep all of their earnings with no franchise or royalty fees cutting into each deal. There’s no production cap, so high producers aren’t penalized for success. Agents pay a $700 annual fee and transaction fees between $165 and $465, depending on plan and volume. It’s a flat, predictable system designed for agents who want financial clarity and full ownership of their income.</p>\n<p>The Agency offers agents commission splits typically ranging from 70/30 to 90/10. While that may sound competitive, the 6% franchise fee applies to every transaction, reducing net income even further. Like Fathom, The Agency does not offer a production cap, so agents continue splitting earnings no matter how much they produce. Monthly office fees vary widely by market, and transaction fees are usually bundled into the royalty cost, but the structure still eats away at take-home pay.</p>\n<p>For agents who want to minimize expenses and avoid watching fees stack up as they grow, Fathom clearly offers the more cost-effective path.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty focuses entirely on commission-based income. There’s no revenue share, no equity program, and no willable income structure. What you earn is what you sell. This works well for agents who want control and simplicity, but there’s no opportunity to grow beyond individual production.</p>\n<p>The Agency mirrors this approach. There’s no passive income model, no bonus structure tied to recruiting, and no ownership opportunities. It’s a commission-only environment where income is always tied directly to transaction volume. While this model might suit agents who prefer selling over mentoring, it doesn’t support those building long-term income strategies.</p>\n<p>In a market where more brokerages are rewarding leadership and production with scalable, passive income, both Fathom and The Agency are starting to feel behind the curve.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty keeps things lean when it comes to support. There’s no formal training platform and no 24/7 assistance. Agents are expected to operate independently and seek out external resources when needed. This works for self-sufficient professionals who’ve already figured out how to thrive, but can be a major drawback for agents who need mentorship or guidance—especially in competitive markets.</p>\n<p>The Agency offers more structured training, but quality varies from office to office. In some markets, agents get hands-on support and development. In others, the brand alone is expected to carry the weight. Like Fathom, The Agency does not provide around-the-clock agent support, which may leave some agents without help during critical deal moments or time-sensitive client needs.</p>\n<p>Agents serious about leveling up tend to look for brokerages that offer consistent, expert-led training and readily available coaching. Neither Fathom nor The Agency currently delivers that at scale.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers agents essential tools for CRM, transaction management, and lead organization. The tech stack isn’t cutting-edge, but it’s reliable and designed to keep operations running smoothly. Agents have the flexibility to bring in their own tools, which is great for those who already have systems in place—but it may not be enough for agents looking for a fully integrated or automated setup.</p>\n<p>The Agency positions itself as a luxury brand and backs that up with polished marketing tools. The branding is clean, high-end, and effective for agents working with million-dollar clients. However, while the marketing is premium, the underlying technology often lags behind more modern brokerages. There’s less focus on automation, CRM integration, or AI-enhanced tools—key advantages that top-producing agents increasingly rely on to scale.</p>\n<p>Fathom wins on flexibility and cost control. The Agency wins on visual polish and high-end presentation. But for agents who want both style and performance, the gap between branding and backend systems might start to show.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty holds a 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor, with agents praising the low fees, the ability to keep their full commissions, and the freedom to run their business without red tape. However, the most common criticism is the lack of structured training and support, especially for those who aren’t already established or self-managed.</p>\n<p>The Agency maintains a 4.1-star rating, with fewer total reviews but a consistent theme: the luxury focus is appealing, the brand recognition is helpful, but the fees and limited training can make it hard for agents to grow unless they already have connections in the high-end space.</p>\n<p>Agents who prioritize earnings and independence tend to be happiest at Fathom. Those who value branding and want to break into luxury may find The Agency attractive—but they’ll need to weigh whether the support and splits actually justify the cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-the-agency\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. The Agency</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is best suited for agents who want to maximize earnings, eliminate unnecessary fees, and maintain full control over how they operate. The lack of support and income diversity might be a turnoff for some, but for experienced agents who just want a low-cost, high-profit setup—it delivers.</p>\n<p>The Agency is a better match for agents already working or wanting to break into luxury markets, especially those who value aesthetics and the social credibility of a premium brand. However, the commission splits, the 6% franchise fee, and the absence of a production cap can seriously impact net income. Add in limited training and passive income opportunities, and the prestige may come at a price.</p>\n<p>For agents seeking a model that offers both profitability and long-term growth, the search often leads beyond traditional structures entirely.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>When comparing Fathom Realty and Douglas Elliman, the differences go far beyond just commission splits. These brokerages represent opposite ends of the spectrum—one built for independence and simplicity, the other grounded in luxury branding and traditional structure. This comparison breaks down the core categories agents care most about, so you can see which model fits your goals.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Douglas Elliman</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\">Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a true 100% commission model. Agents pay no franchise or royalty fees and keep all of their earnings. The only costs are a $700 annual fee and a flat transaction fee that ranges from $165 to $465 per deal, depending on plan structure and production volume. For agents who value transparency and want to control their income, Fathom makes it easy to calculate exactly what you’ll take home on every sale.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman sticks to the traditional commission split model, ranging from 50/50 up to 70/30 depending on experience, production, and negotiation. On top of that, agents are charged a 6% franchise fee that applies to every transaction. Monthly office fees vary by location, adding another layer of unpredictability for agents trying to manage expenses.</p>\n<p>For any agent focused on profitability, Fathom’s structure offers a clear advantage. With Douglas Elliman, the prestige of the brand comes at a real financial cost.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty does not offer any additional income opportunities such as stock programs, revenue share, or legacy income. Agents earn what they sell. This model is best suited for agents who want to stay focused on transactions and don’t mind that their earning power ends with their last closed deal.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman is built similarly. There is no revenue share, no profit share, no stock plan, and no path to earn passive or willable income. Just like Fathom, your only income source is what you close. That’s fine if your only goal is to sell, but limiting if you’re trying to build wealth or future-proof your business.</p>\n<p>For agents looking for a brokerage that offers long-term financial opportunity beyond the next commission check, neither of these two delivers.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty keeps overhead low by forgoing formal training programs. There’s no in-house coaching or structured onboarding beyond basic tools and materials, which works well for experienced agents who already have systems in place. But for newer agents or those switching markets, the lack of support can feel like a gap.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman does offer training, but like many traditional brokerages, it’s handled locally. What you get will depend entirely on your office, your manager, and your specific location. There’s no centralized platform or 24/7 support network to lean on, which can leave agents in a tough spot if they need help outside of business hours.</p>\n<p>In both cases, agents must be self-starters. Fathom agents benefit from a low-cost model but are largely on their own. Douglas Elliman agents may get more in-office attention—if they’re in the right office.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty offers a lean tech platform centered around transaction management and internal communications. It gets the job done but doesn’t offer the kind of integrated marketing, CRM, or automation tools that some competitors do. Agents who are already using outside tools may not mind, but those looking for a fully supported system will need to invest in add-ons.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, in contrast, puts a lot of focus on luxury presentation. The marketing assets are polished, high-end, and geared toward luxury clientele. CRM and digital tools are available and generally more robust, but not always customizable or tech-forward compared to what’s offered at modern cloud brokerages.</p>\n<p>If you want simple systems and the freedom to run your business your way, Fathom will likely suit you. If you’re in luxury markets and need strong brand support and marketing materials that impress, Douglas Elliman brings more to the table.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty earns a strong 4.6-star rating on Glassdoor, with agents praising the 100% commission model and minimal fees. The most common complaints are tied to the lack of training and ongoing support, which can be a dealbreaker for agents who aren’t already self-sufficient.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman has a 3.9-star rating, based on over 600 reviews. While some agents appreciate the brand recognition and the opportunity to work in luxury markets, many mention the commission structure and high fees as sources of frustration. Support and training also receive mixed reviews, depending on the office.</p>\n<p>In short, Fathom agents tend to be satisfied with the financial model, while Douglas Elliman agents are split between loving the brand and feeling constrained by the cost of being there.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-fathom-vs-douglas-elliman\">Final Thoughts on Fathom vs. Douglas Elliman</h3>\n<p>Fathom Realty is ideal for independent agents who want to keep their full commission, work without micromanagement, and skip the endless fee structures that cut into profitability. It’s a streamlined model that rewards agents who already know how to run their business.</p>\n<p>Douglas Elliman, on the other hand, appeals to agents who value brand prestige and operate in high-end markets. But that comes with a price—lower splits, franchise fees, and inconsistent training that make it harder for many agents to scale.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for simplicity and net income, Fathom wins. If you’re prioritizing luxury clientele and marketing presentation, Douglas Elliman might be worth the cost. Either way, it pays to consider what kind of growth you want—and whether your brokerage is really helping you build it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-smart-agent-alliance-agents-thrive-at-e-xp-realty\"><strong>Why Smart Agent Alliance Agents Thrive at eXp Realty</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp\" alt=\"Smart Agent Alliance eXp Realty Sponsor Team\" class=\"wp-image-266464\" title=\"Fathom vs REMAX: Which is Best for Realtors in 2025? 1\" srcset=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team.webp 1000w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-300x59.webp 300w, https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Smart-Agent-Alliance-eXp-Realty-Sponsor-Team-768x152.webp 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n<p>Our team at Smart Agent Alliance is built for agents who want to:</p>\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Keep More Money</strong>: Retain up to <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/\">100% of commissions</a> after cap, with no hidden fees.</li>\n<li><strong>Build Beyond Themselves</strong>: Earn <a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/about-exp-realty/#core-revshare\">revenue share</a> from your team and stock grants for hitting goals.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/exp-realty-sponsor/\">Access Turnkey Systems</a></strong>: From done-for-you lead generation funnels to weekly masterminds with 7-figure agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We don’t believe in “one-size-fits-all” real estate.

    "content": "<p>This comparison between Real Broker and Sotheby’s International Realty will help agents determine which brokerage better fits their professional and financial goals. Both brokerages cater to different agent needs and preferences, offering distinct commission structures, income opportunities, and support systems.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-rank-math-toc-block\" id=\"rank-math-toc\">\n<nav>\n<div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#training-and-support\">Training and Support</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts-on-real-vs-sothebys\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Sotheby’s</a></div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"#join-our-free-team-at-e-xp-realty\">Join our FREE Team at eXp Realty</a></div>\n</div>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"commission-splits-and-fees\">Commission Splits and Fees</h3>\n<p>Real Broker offers a highly competitive commission structure with splits ranging from 85/15 to 100/0. Agents at Real Broker don’t have to worry about franchise or royalty fees, allowing them to keep more of their earnings. The production cap is $12K, meaning once agents hit this cap, they retain 100% of their commission. On top of that, there’s a top agent bonus of $24K, which adds an extra incentive for high-performing agents. Monthly fees are $750/year, with no transaction fees until the cap is reached, making it a straightforward and agent-friendly fee model.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s, on the other hand, has commission splits ranging from 70/30 to 90/10, which can be lower than Real’s most favorable splits. The brokerage also charges a 6% franchise fee, which impacts agents’ take-home pay. Additionally, Sotheby’s does not offer a production cap, meaning agents will continue to split their commissions with the brokerage no matter how much they earn. Monthly fees vary by office, and transaction fees are included in the royalty structure, offering some predictability in costs, but the absence of a cap can significantly reduce an agent’s earnings.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"income-opportunities\">Income Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Real Broker stands out with its revenue share program, which allows agents to earn income by attracting new agents to the brokerage. This adds a passive income stream on top of commissions, making it an appealing option for agents who want to build a team. Real Broker also offers a retirement income path and willable income with time qualification, giving agents more control over their long-term financial planning.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s does not offer a revenue share model, retirement income path, or willable income. Agents at Sotheby’s are limited to their commission-based income, which may not provide the same long-term wealth-building opportunities as Real Broker.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"training-and-support\">Training and Support</h3>\n<p>Real Broker provides agents with 30+ live training sessions per week and offers 24/7 agent support, ensuring agents can access resources and assistance whenever they need them. This extensive support structure makes Real Broker ideal for agents who want continuous education and real-time support.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s provides training that varies by office, meaning the quality of training may depend on the specific location. While the brokerage is known for its prestigious brand and client base, it does not offer 24/7 agent support, which can be a limitation for agents who need immediate help.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"technology-and-resources\">Technology and Resources</h3>\n<p>Real Broker has a modern, cloud-based platform that streamlines transactions and marketing efforts. Agents have access to advanced CRM systems and marketing tools, helping them optimize their workflows and provide top-tier service to clients.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s, being a traditional luxury brand, also offers powerful marketing tools and resources, particularly when it comes to branding and reaching high-end clientele. However, its technology offerings are more geared toward marketing luxury properties rather than cloud-based efficiency.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"agent-satisfaction\">Agent Satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Real Broker holds a strong Glassdoor rating of 4.5 stars from 109 reviews, with agents praising the transparent fee structure, revenue share program, and agent support.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s has a 4.0-star rating from 501 reviews on Glassdoor. While the brand prestige and luxury market focus are often cited as benefits, agents also mention concerns over the higher fees and lack of additional income opportunities outside of commissions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"final-thoughts-on-real-vs-sothebys\">Final Thoughts on Real vs Sotheby’s</h3>\n<p>Real Broker is the better option for agents seeking more favorable commission splits, lower fees, and opportunities to earn passive income through a revenue share program. Its cloud-based platform and comprehensive agent support make it a standout choice for agents looking to build a modern, scalable real estate career.</p>\n<p>Sotheby’s, however, is a good fit for agents targeting luxury clientele who value brand prestige. Its focus on marketing high-end properties and an established global brand are key advantages, but the higher costs and absence of a cap on commissions may not be ideal for every agent.</p>\n<p>For more information, explore our <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/brokerage-comparison/\">eXp vs traditional brokerage comparison</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://wp.saabuildingblocks.com/staging/tools/online-real-estate-brokerage/\">online brokerage comparison</a></strong> pages to get a clearer understanding of which brokerage is right for you.
