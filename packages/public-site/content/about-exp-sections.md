Section 1: Why eXp Exists

  Most brokerages are built to maximize commission today, with little consideration for scale, ownership, or life beyond production.
  eXp was built around that and three more:
  •    Ownership in a publicly traded company
  •    Leverage through scale, systems, and collaboration
  •    Longevity through income that can continue after your last closing
  This structure supports agents while they are actively producing and provides options when they are ready to slow down, step back, or think beyond their
  next deal.

  Where eXp is Unmatched

  These advantages are structural, not promotional.
  Unlike franchise brokerages, eXp Realty does not rely on office-based profit centers.
  Independent validation of the eXp model from third-party organizations
  Ribbon: Glassdoor – Best Places to Work, eight consecutive years;  RealTrends – #1 in U.S. transaction sides; Forbes – America's Best Employers; Public
  company included in the S&P SmallCap Index…

  The following advantages are supported by third-party data and independent analysis. Detailed sources are available in our in-depth research.
  Profitability
  The only cumulatively profitable publicly traded real estate brokerage in recent years.
  Agent Rankings
  Consistently ranked the highest-ranked brokerage by Glassdoor's anonymous agent reviews.
  Innovation
  A cloud-based model that reinvests in systems, support, and agent programs instead of physical offices and franchise layers.
  Sponsor Support
  The only brokerage that allows sponsors to independently build and deliver additional support.

  Stock Ownership
  •    Production-based stock awards
  •    Optional discounted stock purchase program
  •    Ownership in a publicly traded company
  Fees (Simple and Transparent)
  •    $85 per month flat fee
  •    No desk fees
  •    No franchise fees
  •    No royalty fees
  Revenue Share
  •    Seven-tier revenue share paid from company revenue
  •    Can continue after retirement
  •    Can be passed on to heirs
  •    No recruiting requirement
  Revenue share exists as an option, not an obligation.

  Who eXp works best for
  eXp is not for everyone.
  It works best for agents who value:
  •    Independence over hierarchy
  •    Systems over micromanagement
  •    Long-term optionality over short-term perks
  New agents, experienced producers, team leaders, and long-term builders all operate here. How they use the platform is entirely their choice.

  sponsor.

  Section 6: Where Smart Agent Alliance Fits + The Bottom Line

  Where Smart Agent Alliance Fits

  Independent sponsor organizations may operate inside eXp Realty. Sponsors are selected by agents at the time of joining.
  eXp provides the brokerage, compensation model, technology, and global infrastructure.
  Sponsorship exists alongside that foundation.
  Support provided through sponsorship varies by sponsor. eXp Realty does not require sponsors to provide any additional agent support.
  Smart Agent Alliance is a sponsor organization operating inside eXp Realty that does provide additional agent support, including systems, training, and
  community.

  The Bottom Line

  eXp Realty is not trying to be everything to everyone.
  It is designed to be:
  •    Profitable
  •    Scalable
  •    Agent-centric
  •    Globally connected
  If you want a brokerage that combines strong economics with long-term optionality, eXp is worth understanding deeply.
