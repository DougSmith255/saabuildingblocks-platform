# Agent 5 - Incident Documenter - Final Deliverables

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Agent:** Agent 5 - Root Cause Analyst and Incident Documenter
**Status:** ‚úÖ MISSION COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

I've synthesized all previous agent investigations and created comprehensive documentation explaining **WHY** we kept running into deployment button errors. The root cause wasn't a code bug - it was a combination of:

1. **My error:** Changed WordPress hook from `admin_init` to `plugins_loaded` (WRONG)
2. **Infrastructure bottleneck:** PHP-FPM pool exhaustion (5 workers too low)
3. **Architecture issue:** Synchronous blocking workflow (poor UX)

## Key Findings Summary

### The Three Mistakes

**Mistake #1: The Wrong Hook Change (My Error)**
```
WRONG:  add_action('plugins_loaded', 'register_ajax_handlers');
RIGHT:  add_action('admin_init', 'register_ajax_handlers');

Why Wrong: plugins_loaded fires TOO EARLY (before WordPress ready for AJAX)
Result: Created race condition (intermittent failures)
```

**Mistake #2: Never Checked Server Logs**
```
PHP-FPM Log: 100+ warnings "server reached pm.max_children setting (5)"
We didn't look until Session 4
If we'd checked Session 1 ‚Üí Would have found root cause immediately
```

**Mistake #3: Treated Symptoms, Not Root Cause**
```
Session 1: Fix hook timing ‚Üí Still fails
Session 2: Add timeout ‚Üí Still intermittent
Session 3: Increase GitHub timeout ‚Üí Takes longer
Session 4: Finally ask "WHY?" 5 times ‚Üí Find root cause
```

---

### The Correct Fix (Three Parts)

**Part 1: REVERT Hook Change**
- File: `saa-deployment-manager.php` line 334
- Change: `plugins_loaded` ‚Üí `admin_init`
- Why: `admin_init` is CORRECT hook for AJAX registration

**Part 2: Increase PHP-FPM Workers**
- File: `/etc/php/8.1/fpm/pool.d/www.conf`
- Change: `pm.max_children = 5` ‚Üí `pm.max_children = 20`
- Why: 5 workers too low for production with long-running deployments

**Part 3: Keep Timeout Extension**
- File: `class-ajax-handler.php` line 107
- Setting: `set_time_limit(600);`
- Why: This was CORRECT all along (deployments take 30-60s)

---

### Expected Results After Fix

**Immediate (After Revert + Increase Workers):**
- ‚úÖ Deployment button works 100% of time (not intermittent)
- ‚úÖ Zero HTTP 500 errors
- ‚úÖ Zero PHP-FPM pool exhaustion warnings
- ‚úÖ Deployments complete within 60 seconds consistently

**Still Not Fixed (But Acceptable):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User waits 30-60 seconds (synchronous architecture)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No real-time progress updates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't navigate away during deployment

**Future Improvement (Async Pattern):**
- üîÆ User gets immediate response (<1 second)
- üîÆ Real-time progress updates
- üîÆ Background processing
- üîÆ Estimated time: 1-2 hours (API 70% built on Next.js)

---

### Time Cost Analysis

| Phase | Time Spent | Percentage |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Symptom fixes (Sessions 1-3) | 7.5 hours | 91% |
| Root cause fix (Session 4) | 0.75 hours | 9% |
| **Wasted time** | **6.75 hours** | **90%** |

**Lesson:** Root cause analysis upfront saves 10x time

---

## Lessons Learned (Top 5)

### 1. Check Infrastructure Logs FIRST

**Before assuming code bug:**
```bash
# PHP-FPM logs
sudo tail -100 /var/log/php8.1-fpm.log

# Apache logs
sudo tail -100 /var/log/apache2/error.log

# System resources
top
free -h
df -h
```

**Pattern:** Intermittent failures = infrastructure problem 80% of the time

---

### 2. Use "5 Whys" Method

**Template:**
```
1. Why did [error] occur?
2. Why did [answer from #1]?
3. Why did [answer from #2]?
4. Why did [answer from #3]?
5. Why did [answer from #4]?

ROOT CAUSE: [Answer from #5]
```

**Applied to This Incident:**
```
1. Why does button fail? ‚Üí PHP times out
2. Why timeout? ‚Üí Request takes 30-60s
3. Why takes so long? ‚Üí 5 sequential HTTP requests
4. Why can't PHP handle it? ‚Üí Server runs out of workers
5. Why run out? ‚Üí pm.max_children = 5 (too low)

ROOT CAUSE: PHP-FPM configuration + wrong hook
```

---

### 3. Verify WordPress Hook Timing

**Execution Order:**
```
plugins_loaded  ‚Üí For general plugin initialization
init            ‚Üí For post types, taxonomies, general hooks
admin_init      ‚Üí For AJAX registration, admin-specific hooks ‚Üê CORRECT
wp_ajax_*       ‚Üí When AJAX actions fire
```

**Rule:** AJAX handlers register on `admin_init` or `init`, NOT `plugins_loaded`

---

### 4. Intermittent = Resource Exhaustion

**Pattern Recognition:**

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Works sometimes, fails other times | Resource exhaustion |
| HTTP 500 with no debug.log errors | Request never reached PHP |
| Long AJAX wait times | Synchronous blocking |
| Timeout after 30s exactly | PHP default timeout |
| Multiple fixes don't work | Treating symptoms |

---

### 5. User Experience > Developer Convenience

**Wrong Thinking:**
- ‚úÖ Synchronous code is simple
- ‚úÖ Easy to debug
- ‚ùå User waits 60 seconds

**Right Thinking:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Async code is complex
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to debug
- ‚úÖ User gets immediate feedback
- ‚úÖ Better UX

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required

**Priority 1: Apply The Fix**
1. Revert hook change: `plugins_loaded` ‚Üí `admin_init`
2. Increase PHP-FPM workers: 5 ‚Üí 20
3. Restart PHP-FPM service
4. Test deployment button (rapid-fire 5 clicks)

**Priority 2: Update Documentation**
1. Add this incident to CLAUDE.md (prevent future repeats)
2. Create runbook: `DEPLOYMENT-BUTTON-TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
3. Add monitoring script: `monitor-php-fpm.sh`

---

### Medium-Term Improvements

**1. Add Server Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor PHP-FPM pool status
watch -n 1 'systemctl status php8.1-fpm | grep active'

# Alert on pool exhaustion
# (Add to cron or monitoring service)
```

**2. Test Deployment Button Thoroughly**
- Stress test: 10 rapid clicks
- Load test: During high traffic
- Verify: Zero "out of workers" warnings
- Measure: Success rate should be 100%

**3. Document The Fix**
- What: Hook reverted, workers increased
- Why: Root cause was infrastructure, not code
- When: Applied [date]
- Result: Expected 100% success rate

---

### Long-Term Strategy

**Implement Async Deployment Pattern (1-2 hours)**

**Benefits:**
- User gets immediate response
- Real-time progress updates
- Background processing
- Retryable individual steps
- Better error handling

**Status:**
- Async API 70% complete on Next.js
- WordPress just needs to connect to it
- Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

**ROI:**
- Eliminates all timeout issues
- Vastly improves UX
- Enables parallel deployments
- Scales better

---

## Success Metrics

**How to Measure Success:**

```bash
# 1. Check for PHP-FPM warnings (should be ZERO)
sudo grep "pm.max_children" /var/log/php8.1-fpm.log | tail -50

# 2. Test deployment button
#    - Click 5 times rapidly
#    - All should succeed
#    - Zero errors

# 3. Monitor deployment success rate
wp db query "
  SELECT status, COUNT(*)
  FROM wp_saa_deployments
  WHERE started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
  GROUP BY status
" --path=/var/www/html

# Expected: 100% success rate
```

**Before Fix:**
- Success rate: ~60% (intermittent)
- HTTP 500 errors: Common
- PHP-FPM warnings: 100+
- User experience: Poor

**After Fix (Expected):**
- Success rate: 100% (consistent)
- HTTP 500 errors: Zero
- PHP-FPM warnings: Zero
- User experience: Better (works, but still waits)

**After Async Pattern (Future):**
- Success rate: 100%
- Response time: <1 second
- User experience: Excellent
